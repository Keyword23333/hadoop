5380000 why would they not have the same rights as any other citizen of quebec
5380001 i would disagree with this this statement would then suggest that in places that were not colinized by great britain english would not be as alluring but if you have ever travelled to sweden you know that most everybody below a certain age perhaps not only speaks english but speaks it fluently
5380002 ideally i would put in place a single unified school system for everyone where about 80 or 85 of the day would be in french and the rest of the day in english
5380003 the difference between sweden and quebec is that although even immigrants to sweden tend to eventually become bilingual in swedish and english no one native born or immigrant really attempts to live there permanently by learning only english and snubbing swedish and then go about their daily lives expecting every bjorn their run into to speak to them in their second language english
5380004 actually they have even more rights than the vast majority of the citizens of quebec including me since they can choose between two publicly funded school systems in two different languages whereas i can only choose one
5380005 i think this is a great disservice to francophones who want to learn english
5380006 picture it some french speaking kids suddenly start attending predominantly english speaking schools where english is still the language of the playground
5380007 some english kids and take their language to the playgrounds of predominantly french speaking schools
5380008 english teachers are fired en masse and replaced with underqulified people who are rushed in to fill the gaps
5380009 why voluntarily relinquish the one area of quebec society where french isnt believed to be threatened
5380010 and i have never met a single anglo who has or is currently fighting for a segregated school system not a single one
5380011 you just described my high school did every kid at my school become a devoir reading pq voting loco locass fan clubbing qu b co qu b cois not quite but every one learned french everyone learned french through the same curriculum than a kid from saint jean de matha he had the same history program and the same biology program that is what school is about its not about everyone being the same or making everyone the same its about bringing all elements of society together for a season of their lives around some common ideas and values
5380012 if you dont like those values you dont get to opt out you get to fight to change your society
5380013 and qu bec society spontaneously collapses exposed to english the french languages cryptonite why would it be a bad thing for a kid in hochelaga to meet a real live anglo
5380014 we didnt put the indians in reservations to protect them or their culture we put them there so they would go away and die we almost succeeded french culture in north america will live or die in montreal if the french school system is turned into a cultural reservation the culture will die
5380015 the system is segregated anyone who is not trying to unify it is supporting segregation
5380016 and i have never met a single anglo who has or is currently fighting for a segregated school system not a single one
5380017 again there are no anglos that would oppose a unified system but the kind of unification that they would accept is unacceptable to the majority of quebecers therefore we have the present compromise
5380018 since you guys seem well informed about school systems around the world im curious how many countries had a minority language school system for over a century then abolished it
5380019 im sure there are several some have been mentioned already what were the circumstances are there any examples that occured in countries that werent newly independant
5380020 you x people have been very naughty boys and girls
5380021 you know believe it or not there are other ways to learn english than a segregated parallel school system administered by the english speaking minority itself
5380022 a segregated system with two societies living in parallel institutions like the one we have in qu bec today is in my opinion morally wrong and a recipe for permanent conflict
5380023 ultimately i think a unified system with an 85 15 french english ratio like acajack suggested jf lys e a leading pq strategist and backroom player is suggesting 75 25 is what we should we trying to put together perhaps with different ratios for montreal where the challenge is protecting french and integrating immigrants and regions where french is safe and exposure to english inexistant
5380024 publically funded education is such that a state has no responsibility to use those funds to provide language training in any language other than the official language and majority language of the public
5380025 neither however is quebecs unassailable responsibility and it is the height of arrogance for a minority population and 8 is a very small minority to demand that more be done
5380026 whether other countries have minority language education systems or not is irrelevant quebec as a state whose official and vast majority language is french it has no responsibility to teach anyone english just as denmark has no responsibility to teach anyone chinese publically funded education is such that a state has no responsibility to use those funds to provide language training in any language other than the official language and majority language of the public that quebec does provide publically funded english education for a portion of the population is greatly commendable that quebec provides publically funded mandatory english as a second language education is also commendable neither however is quebecs unassailable responsibility and it is the height of arrogance for a minority population and 8 is a very small minority to demand that more be done
5380027 the number of people who expect everyone in quebec to speak english to them is not that high does it exist yes is it much more than a fraction of the non francophone population i doubt it
5380028 whats my point well my point is that i know or know of more unilingual anglophones in my 95 francophone neighbourhood in gatineau and i dont even know everyone in my neighbourhood of course than i know francophones outside quebec out of my hundreds of acquaintances who are unilingual in french
5380029 does that mean that french should be restricted in belgium to ensure that the minority the walloons and newcomers learn better flemish
5380030 really so if i am a francophone living in brussels i will not get even a fraction of services of an anglo in st jean sur richelieu do a quick google search about this brussels while in flanders is something like 90 french speaking and you can definitely get any service you want in french it is officially bilingual and you can definitely get a french language education there it seems like if there was ever place in need of a loi 101 this would be it no brussels is a very important exception to your statement
5380031 given that there is absolute freedom of movement between the english speaking areas of canada and quebec what other choice is there ive already said here that as a francophone i find somewhat humiliating the fact that legal coercion is necessary to maintain at least some level of french here but the alternative is oblivion
5380032 on this i would be interested in knowing what type of unification you think the anglo community in quebec would be willing to accept
5380033 i dont know what would have to be done to make the idea of a single school system acceptable to anglophones
5380034 i was refering to a pre 101 system which admittedly isnt exactly unified my point was simply that the staus quo didnt come about as a result of a desire on the part of anglophones to remain apart i dont know what would have to be done to make the idea of a single school system acceptable to anglophones but i suspect it would require some amount of official bilingualism in the school system and im not talking about the proportion of classes in english and french what language would communication between the school and parents be in what about pta type organizations either youll have to allow some amount of institutionalized bilingualism which is sure to anger many or you go out of your way to eliminate english in schools where the majority of parents speak english as a first language it seems that either way youre setting things up for a conflict where there isnt one at present
5380035 we can go into semantics as to the status of brussels but it is actually the capital of flanders the seat of the flemish was
5380036 were gonna separate and were taking brussels with us na na na na na
5380037 but if you do beleive that french and the quebecois culture is in danger of disappearing what about natives i always want to know what people think about natives and you never answered my above question on a native person from kahnawake going over to chateauguay because it seems like the collective thinking especially among politicians about natives is that its a problem we just want to go away as quietly as possible if quebecois identity is in danger arent natives even more so shouldnt we be legislating that people lear mohawk in school which was the original language in the montreal region
5380038 contrary to french and for a variety of reasons most of which are not the fault of the mohawks the mohawk language today does not have an extensive support structure schools colleges universities media institutions computer software etc
5380039 the way i understand the argument then is that it is too late for native languages so lets make sure the same thing does not happen to french
5380040 but if the native languages are hopeless should we then not protect the languages spoken by them today
5380041 i am still not convinced though that french is in any danger of disappearing there are still francophones in the roc and they still speak french and still consider themselves francophones and they have been living among anglos for an awful long time if a few thousand french speakers can maintain their culture and identity in manitoba how can 6 million in quebec not
5380042 even in canadas capital where i lived for most of my life the recent decline is alarming for the members of the community who pay attention to such things
5380043 personally i am a proud descendant of two families who have been rooted in roc provinces for close to 400 years however i am growing tired of having these feisty but struggling communities used as political leverage against quebec and its aspirations
5380044 this makes me wonder about the relationship the mohawks have with english is it part of their identity like the english language truly became for the irish when they lost their original language or is it just a practical thing
5380045 and once again if thats what the people want i would also be totally favourable to restrictions on the use of french in the quebec city suburb of wendake where hurons live or in innu communities on the north shore like betsiamites and maliotenam
5380046 mohawks speak english therefore they must have rights outside the reservation but not the right to claim the land under my bungalow in st lambert though so i must be allowed unrestricted english services for myself in ddo
5380047 if i accept your logic that english services is a right of mohawks as natives then you must accept my argument that bill 101 is a legislation enacted to protect the linguistic rights french speaking natives dont you
5380048 we ignored your comment because we know you dont mean it you dont care about natives or their rights ive never heard in my entire life an anglo make an argement about native rights whose conclusion was not
5380049 can you provide some numbers for this and the reasonns behind the decline
5380050 kahnawake mohawks used to be mostly bilingual mohawk and french not english english came to dominate only relatively recently
5380051 thanks rory you raised several point i would have never thought of all of which further confirms my view that although a unified system might be desirable it would be virtually impossible to implement for the foreseeable future thats why im not in favour of tinkering with it

5380061 in the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an american and assimilates himself to us he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birthplace or origin but this is predicated upon the persons becoming in every facet an american and nothing but an american there can be no divided allegiance here any man who says he is an american but something else also isnt an american at all we have room for but one flag the american flag we have room for but one language here and that is the english language and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the american people
5380062 let us say to the immigrant not that we hope he will learn english but that he has got to

5380140 will you go with me in my canoe i am on my way to an island where there are pretty birds and you can shoot as many as you please
5380141 poor boy it was the same with me but i will help you if you will do me a service go to that tree
5380142 dig on the west side of it and you will find a pouch of smoking mixture and a pipe bring them to me you can get a flint on the shore bring that also
5380143 now i feel better and can tell you what to do to escape my fate a giant is coming to night with three dogs to hunt you and kill you for his supper you must lose the trail for them by jumping into the water many times on your way to a hollow tree which you will find on the other side of the island in the morning after they have gone come to me
5380144 you are a brave boy to night the man who brought you here will come to drink your blood you must go down to the shore before the darkness comes and dig a pit in the sand lie down in it and cover yourself with sand when he leaves his canoe get into it and say come swans let us go home if the man calls you you must not turn round or look at him when you are free do not forget the skeleton
5380145 you must not go home yet travel toward the east three days and you will come to some huge rocks there you will see a young girl drawing water from a spring she is your sister wild sage whom the giant stole many moons since and whom you believed dead you will be able to get her away when you have done so come back to me

5380155 theres no reason for parking to be paid for by people who dont own cars
5380156 a parking minimum really makes no sense at all for communities where less than 20 percent of households own cars because it drives up the cost of housing and takes up valuable space that otherwise could be used to create additional units or public space

5380167 consider jesus christ who endured from sinners such hostility against himself
5380168 my son do not regard lightly the discipline of the lord
5380169 it is for discipline that you have to endure god is treating you as sons for what son is there whom his father does not discipline if you are left without discipline in which all have participated then you are illegitimate children and not sons besides this we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them shall we not much more be subject to the father of spirits and live for they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them but he disciplines us for our good that we may share his holiness for the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it
5380170 in this you greatly rejoice though now for a little while if need be you have been grieved by various trials that the genuiness of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire may be found to result in praise honor and glory at the revelation of jesus christ

5380181 now imagine that for the 250th anniversary of celebrating that monumental achievement it was decided that johnny halliday would perform in french at the grand finale concert
5380182 this has nothing to do with language politics but of course explaining that to a nationalist is like explaining darwinism to a southern evangelist its a lost cause
5380183 for arguments sake i could see charles aznavour performing at your concert without putting anybodys nose out of joint
5380184 aznavour was already there he performed on july 6 in front of about 100 000 people
5380185 shit johnny halliday coulndt fill a church basement in the suburbs of paris comparing him to mccartney is a little rich for arguments sake i could see charles aznavour performing at your concert without putting anybodys nose out of jount
5380186 english speaking montrealers dont see themselves as a single homogenous group that can trace its history back to a single origin
5380187 the thing is your comparison doesnt work because a great number of quebecs residents are not just familiar with mccartney but have been life long fans if a non english speaking artist had that kind of a connection with the english speaking population of montreal i dont think there would be an issue at all
5380188 you picked halliday at random to make a point that somehow quebec shouldnt celebrate by inviting an englishman just as english mtl wouldnt celebrate by inviting a frenchman i countered with aznavour just to point out that nationality has nothing whatsoever to do with popularity aznavour is very popular amongst english mtlers just as mccartney is with french speaking quebeckers
5380189 you can focus on being a victim of the british for another 200 years and it wont change the reality
5380190 english speaking montrealers dont see themselves as a single homogenous group that can trace its history back to a single origin
5380191 why not can you prove it in fact the connection between english canada to the british isles was much stronger and more intimate than the almost non existant connection between quebec and france a contact between the two took place on july 14 1855 following 95 years of almost complete isolation
5380192 the thing is your comparison doesnt work because a great number of quebecs residents are not just familiar with mccartney but have been life long fans if a non english speaking artist had that kind of a connection with the english speaking population of montreal i dont think there would be an issue at all
5380193 its not about how popular the artist is or how many records he she has sold its about the relevance and significance of that artist to that audience and ultimately to that event
5380194 if anglophones decided to attend aznavours hypothetical concert itd be only to hear english being sung
5380195 you may believe that the theme of the event ought to have been exclusively the celebration of french in north america but really it is a celebration of the founding of a city french of course is going to be a major theme but the belief that the entire event should be organised around the french language is but one opinion
5380196 this is also why shakira redoes redid all of her spanish language hits in english as do many other non anglophone recording artists
5380197 some might call it narrow minded but if 90 of the world spoke french or could converse in french you would have the same situation with the native french speakers as you do with the anglos now
5380198 unlike you i actually find it a little disturbing its as if nothing else is valid or worthwile until its blessed and baptized in english its haughty condescending and ridiculous
5380199 the theme of the event is exactly that the celebration of french in north america
5380200 you even see this today among a small minority of francophone quebecers who will proudly tell you that they only watch american tv for example everything else without exception is crap
5380201 good that you mentioned jerry bruckheimer style explosions on this i wonder if eventually the increased accessibility of digital film making technologies wont ultimately allow many other countries to challenge hollywoods global stranglehold on action packed blockbusters and science fiction as well
5380202 frankly the only thing that i fail to see is how either you or i are in a position to decide what should and shouldnt be the theme of the celebration i acknowledge that your view is shared by some but for some reason you cant see how the support from the public for the mccartney concert alone is proof that not everybody agrees
5380203 acajack that is indeed what i am suggesting i base my assertion on a shaky foundation it is true the number of comments in english many from canadians apparently and in broken french to the songs that two of my favorite groups les 3 accords and les cf have had posted on youtube
5380204 most of us here in our little english speaking islands have historically found pop music in french insipid i know i did do but i dont think that qu b cois pop is insipid at all to my un artsy ear a great many qu bec artists have not only mastered rock and roll they have added elements to it
5380205 wasnt it a bunch of expatriate german scientists led by werner von braun that allowed the united states space program to develop and flourish
5380206 one of my best friends in university was a born and bred anglo montrealer who was very very knowledgeable in modern music genres he once told me quite assuredly that francophone quebec had not produced one single musically significant work not one as a francophone totally disconnected from my own heritage at the time i didnt really pay much attention to this statement but it certainly did come to mind in later years when i reconnected with francophone culture and got to know harmonium beau dommage paul pich robert charlebois etc
5380207 dont you have anything better to do than posting messages at 2 30 in the morning
5380208 the concert has come and gone but still there are those which want to spend time analyzing the effect and the whys move on
5380209 so how about you move on with the quebec provincial budget

5380220 if a child of parents who are not in the public eye could reasonably expect not to have photographs of him published in the media so too should the child of a famous parent
5380221 in our opinion it is at least arguable that a child of ordinary parents could reasonably expect that the press would not target him and publish photographs of him

5380285 dan morris always jokes that im the one user of mysong
5380286 there are progressions i use now in my music that i learned from mysong

5380340 there are powerful arguments that senator mccain or anyone else in this position is constitutionally qualified but there is certainly no precedent
5380341 unpredictable and unsatisfactory it is certainly not a frivolous issue

5380345 its preposterous that a technicality like this can make a difference in an advanced democracy
5380346 no court will get close to it and everyone else is on board so theres a constitutional consensus the merits of arguments such as professor chins aside

5380387 the right formula or the ideal balance between repression and tolerance can best be sought if the mind is freed of liberal norms or impossible and nearly meaningless verbalisms such as free speech free press freedom of conscience and so forth and if an attempt is made quite simply to determine the minimum of governmental repression compatible with safety for a given plan in a given situation
5380388 for public safety has highly elastic requirements varying enormously according to the place moment total situation and scheme of values to be realized
5380389 only an executive can insure the widest measure of tolerance and he can do this only if he has the widest power to adjust formulas to changing conditions
5380390 the explicitness of government uses of force and the noticeability of sudden change in the application of force for the achievement of new or different objectives make state exercises of power call them what you will the subject of considerable misrepresentation and misconception where a new social system like communism or fascism is involved
5380391 it may be said that the coercion most keenly felt is the most important or oppressive to this it need only be answered that where the coercions of government social custom or economic necessity are of long standing and efficient application the people subject to them are no more conscious of them than habitual motorists are conscious of frustration by traffic lights or than habitual travelers in the subways and elevators are conscious of frustration in these unnatural and often extremely uncomfortable modes of transportation those who accept without conscious resentment the discomfort of crowded subways or elevators feel amply compensated by the superior speed and facility of transportation thus afforded them they do not discuss subways or elevators in terms of claustrophobia as many liberals discuss government in terms of liberty and constraint or in terms wholly irrelevant to the points of paramount public interest in the thing discussed
5380392 fascist planning does not involve the introduction of force as a new principle and quantitative measurements of coercion and freedom are impossible
5380393 when planning enters the realm of reality it enters the realm of force and coercion and this is seen in the cases of millions who are forced to suffer privation and humiliation under liberal capitalism as well as in the cases of millions under the authoritarian systems who are forced to accept various impositions of the state plan the idea that one social plan gives freedom while another imposes coercion is like the idea that the difference between a horse and a cow is that the one has a head while the other has a tail

5380415 if private ownership and management of producers goods is to be preserved even in a modified form it will be necessary to adopt a formula which can quickly straighten out the worst of the existing maladjustments due to the use of fixed money obligations prevent as far as possible the recurrence of these and other types of maladjustment and correct promptly in the future any maladjustments which occur in spite of preventive measures
5380416 a debtless economy free of fixed interest charges and without legal enforcement of contracts which stipulate fixed money payments regardless of economic results is the only formula of private ownership and management which can be made to work in anything but a frontier era when lucky strikes and the steady rise in land values can be counted on to make the number of the victims of usury too small to have cognizance taken of them by ethics law or political economy
5380417 more explicitly an ideal scheme of immediate procedure in debt reorganization might work somewhat as follows

5380432 it was important to the ancients to preserve a unique body posture this teaching was developed many thousands of years ago and passed along by teachers of the highest order they knew that certain times in history were more powerful than others and preserved this teaching in stone holy books and in oral traditions which would assist us during this time this posture represents the greatest form of teaching possible the transmission of wisdom beyond words using only the slightest possible effort the concept of working with ecstatic or spiritual body postures is a fascinating study in our modern age it was pioneered by anthropologist dr felicitas d goodman her research which she began in 1977 revealed a long dormant secret by aligning our bodies in certain specific positions we can consciously connect with the powerful realm of spirit known to the spiritual traditions as the dreamtime the garden heaven or in the case of the ancients as tula since 1977 dr goodman has identified nearly fifty postures from such sources as ethnography books and museum exhibits for those wishing further insight i recommend dr goodmans where the spirits ride the wind trance journeys and other ecstatic experiences

5380601 the relative price stability of the past 15 years is giving way to worsening inflation despite the recent softening of oil prices the consumer price index for all items shows the inflation rate averaged 2 6 a year from 1992 through 2007 but has doubled since january reaching an annual rate of 5 6 in july businessweek com 8 14 08 by next year the monthly figure could hit double digits and the inflation rate for 2009 overall could triple 2007s 2 85 most americans will have to tighten their belts and accept lower living standards unless this inflationary spiral can be stopped there will be pain higher prices and a weaker economy resulting in fewer jobs meanwhile millions of americans who are already feeling poorer because of falling home values and a soft economy will be further pinched by higher prices for heating oil groceries clothing autos and appliances labor is unlikely to remain so quiescent particularly as the expectation of inflation becomes clear

5380628 its safe to say that rads users love their ide and tools as well as the support and care they get from ibm
5380629 theres still a huge amount of development that is contingent upon ides
5380630 its really not an out of the box ide its an ide that youve got to assemble whereas the others are out of the box ides
5380631 billys toxic britney bitch michael jackson amp rick james amp white stripes
5380632 if you do something 60 times you are going to develop some best practices
5380633 if theres one thing ibm is good at its putting processes in place and operationalizing them
5380634 if you integrate too quickly you smother the fire that made the acquired company special
5380635 but if you dont integrate fast enough then you dont leverage the synergies i think ibm has figured out a nice balance between those two things
5380636 there are very few companies out there that are able to acquire companies and do a good job at integrating them
5380637 ibm is one of a handful i dont say that just because i love it here statistically if you look at the acquisition process about 30 percent of acquisitions actually hit the target in terms of the synergies that create the premium that make you want to acquire somebody which is really quite dismal at ibm our percentage is much higher
5380638 semantically related things should be clustered together and kept separate where they are not
5380639 a bug which costs 1 to fix on the programmers desktop costs 100 to fix once it is incorporated into a complete program and many thousands of dollars if it is identified only after the software has been deployed in the field
5380640 but i must say that we were too tired by the night before to have any big reaction
5380641 this has been the holy grail of computer science for many decades
5380642 but now in some very key areas were building tools that can do actual proof about the software and how it works in order to guarantee the reliability
5380643 it is time to have an efficient sat solver on these platforms
5380644 developing an efficient algorithm to solve sat impacts the resolution of many other important problems
5380645 i knew that this first competition on parallel search was for me when i saw the announcement
5380646 time was the biggest challenge the first version of manysat was made in a week i knew that we would have to compete against several parallel solvers that already had proved their capacity and that were highly tuned
5380647 they helped a lot in contributing new ideas and tuning the solver
5380648 they also gave me access to their university cluster and this proved essential to fully test manysat on thousands of industrial benchmarks
5380649 we had to submit to the second and final qualification round
5380650 if something had been wrong there we would have had no chance to correct and qualify but things went well and overall we qualified in the first position we were a bit surprised by our performance
5380651 we have the best multicore based sat solver in the world
5380652 is to transfer some of the knowledge gained during this manysat experience into microsoft products
5380653 before being a race against competitors because of that many sat did not benefit from any prior specification steps we were inventing a very effective technique and now we have to fully describe and analyze it

5380678 you know just doing it the way the book shows it until i get it mumble mumble
5380679 america is at that awkward stage its too late to work within the system but too early to shoot the bastards
5380680 we have only a one party government its the winners and then everybody else is the losers and the winners divided into two parties the republicans and the democrats what a charade the combat between the republicans and the democrats is its rich kids we had to choose between two members of skull and bones

5380690 the complexity of this system causes me to have the opinion that most of these pathologies are rooted in the persistence of certain thought patterns if they last long enough they can reset the brain as in the baroreceptor reflex if they get too strong they can escape their feedback loop as leptin does

5380697 the key issues in programming relate to people and the way they communicate and organise themselves
5380698 dynamic analysis tools say well youve got a problem on something over here
5380699 static analysis tools say youve got a problem on line 123
5380700 if new tools do not fit with existing ways of doing things no one will use them
5380701 were where network security was in 1995 when some people didnt even have a firewall
5380702 people would use our tool and find out that they had many reliability problems and many potential security problems but the cost of researching and fixing them all was astronomical so they would give up
5380703 not only did we have multiple pieces of technology from multiple vendors and multiple sources but we had multiple versions within those
5380704 for example we were running two or three versions of linux which created the need to create three user test cases in qa quality assurance to ensure that all three versions of the operating system would behave the same multiply that by all of the permutations of everything and that led to a very long and complex qa process
5380705 even as we were writing very clean software on our end we would have integration issues mitigating our integration issues became a finger pointing exercise
5380706 i just wanted to be able to call one vendor to solve a problem
5380707 as a dot com the business relies heavily on technology and they werent able to deliver more than one project in a year with their existing setup basically they had reached a screeching halt in their business
5380708 the soa environment will allow them to be agile and use plug and play technologies in such a way that their business can react faster to market conditions and eventually become proactive
5380709 no matter the target environment portal process server websphere or application server developers are dealing with familiar tools and the same environment
5380710 this leads to agility and reuse as well as quick ramp up times for our developers
5380711 what seems very simple to flag a vehicle as a cpo from a manufacturer actually consisted of a lot of steps and infrastructure and it took several weeks and a lot of manual effort
5380712 now the cpo feeds happen much more quickly and we even have a project underway where we will be able to roll out three cpos at once
5380713 we just couldnt have been able to scale to those levels
5380714 as we see the ability to use this platform for more business initiatives we continue to add scope to the re architecture
5380715 weve built a bridge to our legacy platform and we use the phrase when we blow up the bridge well be done at this point were looking at another couple of years if we execute our current roadmap
5380716 ibm rational developer for system z v7 1 continues to make mainframe developers happy
5380717 the ibm software combines the strength of a powerful graphical user interface with the advantages of the consistently managed mainframe and uses existing and proven technology
5380718 two of the top needs we hear from our clients are simplifying their i t infrastructure and gaining more business value from their i t investments the modern mainframe helps with both
5380719 these modern enhancements have been designed to shorten what used to take multiple months down to approximately a couple of weeks our clients will greatly benefit from faster application deployment and freeing valuable it resources for more strategic projects
5380720 i think in general we have 1 000 plus people using agile in the ibm community
5380721 agile is taking many things that weve been using for a lot of years before agile was around and adding a lot of new things and putting a very good spin on it and making development more human
5380722 we firmly believe and our executives firmly believe that the most successful organizations of tomorrow will be the ones able to adopt agile principles
5380723 its pretty obvious that the whip approach only works for a while
5380724 this helps us get some assistance to teams in their quest to become more agile
5380725 ibm is redefining how software development and delivery will be done in the future
5380726 open commercial development at jazz net is changing the way ibm products are delivered to customers by making the process truly a community effort
5380727 jazz is a wonderful example of the technical innovation that is occurring on the eclipse platform
5380728 ibm has a well deserved reputation in the eclipse community for producing great technology and i am sure our community will be very interested in this new product
5380729 with ibm rational appscan standard chartered bank is educating its developers and it staff on the importance of web application security incorporated throughout the development lifecycle
5380730 ibm rational appscan lets us establish best practice in our coding and testing processes thereby ensuring the security and compliance of our web applications this is reducing costs enhancing the security of our products and improving our security testing productivity
5380731 traditionally web application security testing has been owned by security experts but that is not enough to stay in synch with the requirements of processes within companies today
5380732 the addition of ibm rational appscan will help users save time and money by incorporating web application testing much earlier in the software lifecycle process
5380733 there is no acceptable margin of error for military defense systems automobile safety and space exploration and increasingly these customers are turning to ibm to help them make certain that all systems are a go
5380734 the challenges faced by todays software developers are about team collaboration productivity and working across borders and time zones its important for our students to understand the global dynamics of software development and jazz provides us with a platform for that
5380735 the ibm jazz projects we are conducting help our students investigate how to improve communication and collaboration in globally distributed teams using leading edge technology from one of the best software companies in the world

5380741 tell you what ill schedule you to talk with a nutritionist who can beat into your head the importance of essential fatty acids reduced simple sugar intake high quality protein intake breakfast and 4 6 smaller portioned meals a day then you can meet with a cscs certified strength and conditioning specialist for another hour who will explain to you how to jump on the stairstepper for 30 minutes 4 times a week on the hill or strength or fat burner program and supplement that with weight training you can come back in three months having lost 15 lbs and ill re evaluate you then
5380742 well treat you thats what we do but if youre not going to put the time and effort into taking care of your body you can pay a bit more of the costs of your medication

5380745 providing secondary spill containment at railroad tank car loading racks that is compliant with the epas spcc spill prevention control and countermeasures regulations is our number one priority
5380746 we have worked with owners engineers and design build contractors throughout the industry providing a safe and compliant railroad spill collection pan system for the bio fuels industry

5380748 do i have any regrets sure i regret that i didnt videotape my passing and post it on youtube bet you it would have gotten a lot of hits i regret not dying a moment after someone in the room laid a big fart so hed think hey i didnt mean to
5380749 but i look on the bright side its always good to die
5380750 not to mention all the time ill be saving no more time wasted doing a number one or a number two no more number three either whatever the hell
5380751 i know what youre asking are there seven words you cant say in heaven as a matter of fact there are these are the seven words you cant say in heaven bush cheney rove rumsfeld wolfowitz gonzales and libby and libby doesnt even belong on the list man its such a friendly word sounds like a nickname scooter libby come on the first name is a pie the last name is a canned fruit
5380752 im interested in how music makes me feel if it was an early who single im interested in how that made me feel and i a lot of other kids feel or what about a motown record made a lot of us dance at a particular time but im more interested in how it does that musically i think thats the underlying core at it the way that the backbeat and bass line works rather than something else thats how i listen to music i listen to the notes
5380753 little rock criticism is concerned with music because most rock critics are less concerned with sound than sociology this can have depressing consequences for instance springsteens success is defined in terms of his critical cult punk imagery or his dramatic stage show hardly anyone has discussed his inventive use of song structure multiple bridges for example his extraordinary guitar effects or the simple power of his voice
5380754 i think something else that i did which not many people male or female have the technical expertise as both musicians and writers to do was to really try to get inside and explain the process of making rock music and records which is what i still call them even if now theyre really cds or files or whatever you know what i mean most rock writers are people with literary aspirations who appreciate music but really dont understand how to do it or else they probably would there are people who write for guitar mags who may have some more knowledge about how to tap like eddie van halen but they have even less elegance or imagination when it comes to the english language of course there are just as many great rock musicians who cant really articulate what it is that they do
5380755 it would be better if he or she knew enough about performance practices to be able to identify specific techniques and better still if the reviewer could follow a theme and variations recognize basic forms of counterpoint and identify common harmonies not because that sort of information belongs in every review rather if the reviewer understands on a structural level whats going on in the music it will be that much easier for him or her to explain his or her observations to the reader provided of course that he or she writes well enough to make those ideas comprehensible
5380756 periodically i get to feeling guilty because i am a music critic i hate the term but i suppose it applies who knows nothing about music i have listened to a lot of rock and jazz of course and i do know a good deal about the development of american music but i cant read music after several patient lessons i am hard pressed to detect even the simplest chord changes i never count time and i dont know the first thing about harmony actually i do know the first thing it has to do with sound waves i dont know the second thing furthermore i know that stuff means something to musicians even rock musicians worse still some listeners care about it too
5380757 for the record i think an understanding of the basics of music theory and notation as well as an overview of western classical history will help any pop writer this information gives you another way to talk about tunes and performers a significant way but simply one among many
5380758 most people enjoy music and have opinions on what works and what doesnt without having any music education just as people can enjoy novels and poetry without having studied literature it may be useful to have some understanding of how things work technically but so far theres no evidence that music education makes for better rock criticism the reverse if anything
5380759 i dont think critics should stay away from anything a critic should learn as much about music as possible from any angle that seems interesting music theory history psychology literature theater acoustics religion dance anthropology film theory pharmacology economics fashion linguistics electronics sports and all the other things that touch on music playing an instrument and being in a band help you appreciate what musicians have to learn how groups make decisions and how songs feel from the inside its one way though not the only way to understand how music works
5380760 to evaluate rock music as music the peripherals need to be set aside the look of a band where theyre coming from is musically irrelevant the difference between good heavy metal and bad heavy metal can only be determined just as you would determine the difference between good and bad funk or country by focusing on the music played bad clothes or hair is irrelevant even bad lyrics and hackneyed melodies though worth discussing may not tell the listener anything about the bands ability as rock musicians
5380761 so contrary to the letter writers who righteously and semi regularly demand that musician drop the biographical trivia and concentrate on the music i say it cannot be done you might as well demand that sophocles cut the oedipus anecdotes and concentrate on incest or that shakespeare cut the hamlet crap and get to the point about ruling class decadence or that tolstoy deal with the issues of war and peace not the personalities
5380762 meme of the day its all about the music man

5380764 i believe most sincerely that it is now time for canadians to unfurl a flag that is truly distinctive and truly national in character as canadian as the maple leaf which should be its dominant design a flag easily identifiable as canadas a flag which cannot be mistaken for the emblem of any other country a flag of the future which honours also the past canadas own and only canadas
5380765 there are other members of the same natural order rodentia such as rats and mice not less active and industrious than the beaver and for this quality alone no one would dream of selecting one of these vermin for our national emblem
5380766 no recognition of history no indication of the existence of french and english canada or the partnership of the races no acknowledgement of history
5380767 the maple leaf flag is neither unmistakably canadian nor a unifying force its only advantage is that it is innocuous that it produces tepid approval mild disapproval or indifference that it can therefore be adopted without any display of strong feeling whatever
5380768 do you think maybe its too busy at the base

5380779 our resolution appeals to the nationalist elements that it is high time they speak against separatists who are supported by the isi
5380780 congress has bent in front of separatists in the same manner that the rajiv gandhi government had succumbed in the shah bano case
5380781 im waiting for the building inspectors to do their jobs because they are not doing their jobs

5380791 when paul wolfowitz uses his influence as a us government official and as president of the world bank to fill the purse of his paramour and by inference to line his own pockets as well one can hear the cackling from state houses and presidential palaces all across africa
5380792 paul wolfowitz should resign now before his poor example and bad judgment are emulated by petty dictators and venal middle managers throughout the developing world

5380842 the soviets pointed out however that not all of this material reached its destination as some soviet vessels and ships chartered from other countries were sunk by the italians or forced into ports held by francos nationalist forces

5380844 today building software and applications is akin to building a car there are many parts built by different companies that go into the car and all of these have to work together properly for the car to run
5380845 specifically the car manufacturer and various part vendors have to agree on how their parts will interact and affect only these interactions failing to do so by making unjustified assumptions based on observations can cause unforeseen failures in a car and inconvenience to the end user
5380846 todays pace of technology evolution makes software compatibility an even more important and challenging problem
5380847 anyone developing a new or updated part must ensure that it works correctly with older systems as well as future systems it thus becomes critical to have contracts between different parts of the software that govern the behavior of those parts
5380848 are caused by third party device drivers that do not adhere to the required protocol underlining the importance of defining these contracts
5380849 however there is a catch to using software verification tools
5380850 the rules must be stated in a formal language that the tools understand it is not enough to have documentation in english as is the common practice today
5380851 what we are doing may boil down to speculation because it is statistical
5380852 we are trying to come up with what are likely rules but there is no guarantee they will be true because they are based on observations we expect human experts to look at the candidate rules inferred by our tool to validate or correct them
5380853 but we can assume that by and large most programs use any particular resource in a correct manner there may be variations in how the programs work but overall certain patterns will emerge whenever the contract constrains the programs behavior
5380854 can identify scenarios where the program may fail to follow a rule

5380916 israel to bring about the dissolution and fragmentation of the arab states into a mosaic of ethnic groupings
5380917 the dissolution of syria and iraq into ethnically or religiously unique areas such as in lebanon is israels primary target on the eastern front iraq rich in oil on the one hand and internally torn on the other is guaranteed as a candidate for israels targets its dissolution is even more important for us than that of syria iraq is stronger than syria in the short run it is iraqi power which constitutes the greatest threat to israel
5380918 an iraqi iranian war will tear iraq apart and cause its downfall at home even before it is able to organize a struggle on a wide front against us every kind of inter arab confrontation will assist us in the short run and will shorten the way to the more important aim of breaking up iraq into denominations as in syria and lebanon
5380919 in iraq a division into provinces along ethnic religious lines as in syria during ottoman times is possible so three or more states will exist around the three major cities basra baghdad and mosul and shiite areas in the south will separate from the sunni and kurdish north
5380920 a clean break a new strategy for securing the realm
5380921 should make a clean break with the oslo peace process and reassert israels claim to the west bank and gaza it presented a plan whereby israel would shape its strategic environment beginning with the removal of saddam hussein to serve as a first step toward eliminating the anti israeli governments of syria lebanon saudi arabia and iran
5380922 a comprehensive political and military strategy for bringing down saddam hussein and his regime
5380923 while the unresolved conflict in iraq provides the immediate justification the need for a substantial force presence in the gulf transcends the issue of the regime of saddam hussein
5380924 even if evidence does not link iraq directly to the recent attack any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove saddam hussein from power in iraq we believe the administration should demand that iran and syria immediately cease all military financial and political support for hezbolah and its operations
5380925 when all is said and done the conflict in afghanistan will be to the war on terrorism what the north africa campaign was to wwii an essential beginning on the path to victory but compared with what looms over the horizon a wide ranging war in locales from central asia to the middle east and unfortunately back to the u s emphasis added afghanistan will prove to be an opening battle but this will not end in afghanistan it is going to spread and engulf a number of countries in conflicts of varying intensity it could well require the use of american military power in multiple places simultaneously

5380941 since its based on open standards the consistent and unified nature of the ibm software architecture helps curtail any problems that might present themselves down the road rational rose real time software was the right choice for the critical nature of the james webb space telescope the software is much easier to manage and maintain pre and post launch
5380942 achieving predictability and quality in business critical software application deployment
5380943 our goal was to improve the quality of our software applications by implementing a standardized software development process that is supported by industry leading tools

5380946 ibms market leading offerings help our clients develop quality software and manage their it infrastructure while integrating quality management across the software development lifecycle
5380947 when ibm donated eclipse five years ago we were thrilled by the possibilities of an open and universal platform to build blend and integrate development tools from various vendors and open source projects and with todays launch it is here to use
5380948 the new delivery platform gives customers freedom of choice it starts with an ibm supported pure and current eclipse environment and grows non disruptive to completeness with the ability to use the integrated functionality of one of several rational products the result is a stunningly flexible and powerful development environment that adapts in the same way an soa based system would

5380953 the first step in our soa strategy has led to a direct dollar savings of 15 000 per integration interface which are now implemented as reusable services as reuse of the soa platform continues and these numbers hold true we anticipate this savings on at least 15 new integration interfaces over the next 24 months not to mention the soft dollar implications on resource utilization costs and efficiency as those resources can now focus their efforts on other fronts
5380954 with these new initiatives ibm is not only helping business partners realize the potential of soa for driving business were helping them better understand how soa helps customers align technology with business strategy
5380955 at the top of cios wish lists today are service oriented architectures which can help drive greater business flexibility improve operational efficiencies and align it investments more effectively with business priorities
5380956 critical to the success of any soa project is managing quality throughout the lifecycle

5380982 see i told you so burning man was just a fad it was only a minute before someone sold out and turned it into a corporate thing see i told you so everything you lived for regarding burning man was only a fantasy
5380983 people who work full time on logistics for making a slab of nevada desert home stage gallery and canvas for 40 000 people deserve to make a living at it
5380984 people who work full time on logistics for making a slab of nevada desert home stage gallery and canvas for 40 000 people deserve to make a living at it
5380985 there is no other reason to retain these legal ownership titles other than to capitalize on their brand value at some later date
5380986 this person is too much of a pain in the ass to deal with
5380987 i saw this thing on mtv its a place where you can do drugs and chicks walk around naked and woooooo dale earnhardt rules
5380988 its a good idea for brllc to control the trademark and eliminate that legal weak spot and protect the trademark from exploitation its also a good idea bad blood or not for them to acknowledge that you were critical to the creation of this thing and pay you something decent for it
5380989 if burning man gets too big well just shut it down and do something else
5380990 it will be co opted by corporate branding yes it is unfortunate that the name is held in a for profit llc but look around that is what it takes to protect somthing as important and big as bm
5380991 if bm becomes public domain it will be co opted by corporate branding
5380992 two years later on the heels of the disastrous for the organizers 96 bm i resigned from active involvement in the event
5380993 helco a supra national conglomerate attempts to buy out burning man and fails
5380994 seems like john law took the flight approach when the going got tough the event has grown 5 times since you left john
5380995 because i worked for the company as a fulltime worker before i got a job with the dod in iraq i had to resign among other things besides refusing to take care of employees hurt on the job paying less money than anyone in a 100 mile radius forcing employees to live in unsafe conditions feeding them from a kitchen that still falls short of county health codes the real reason was when i was a worker one of the owners of the burning man llc will roger peterson threw a female worker into a fire and refused to give her medical treatment unless she had sex with him numerous people had to intervene to save her life the entire dpw revolted they fired those who talked and they still let this man live and work among the employees and your ticket money pays him 40 000 and his rent in oakland the event is alright but with larry harvey and the rest of his company refuse to follow human decency abuse woman let the man get away with it and still live and work among the dpw and in the past three years they lowered the pay of the dpw 30 they pay the least and think it is ok to physically abuse workers yeah i have a problem
5380996 burning man belongs to us the burners lets take the power back and make it like it used to be
5380997 i feel that jl springing this matter on the courts rather than presenting this info to us the community shows a surprising lack of faith in the unity and independence we all strive for
5380998 you appoint burning man as your representatitve to take actions necessary to protect your intellectual property or privacy rights
5380999 the only jury that matters a jury of your peers
5381000 burning man never sought out any publicity the media just came to us
5381001 i heard you say burner do you know where the party is tonight
5381002 i have full faith that the name of the event is in safe hands with those that sustain and uphold the integrity and mission of the event criticism is healthy but mistruths born of misplaced anger in my view seems to foster further mistruths born of misplaced anger
5381003 i dont know the exact definition of open source but i have a feeling that it fits pretty much what burning man is a protected trust held for the best to freely contribute to for the betterment of all how ever anyone may see fit your gifts are cherished by me and i never heard anyone deny the wonderfulness of them
5381004 larry in my very clear view has never been in a position to try and grab steal take or whatever the name idea or concept of
5381005 in 1986 jerry james cobbled together an 8 foot tall human figure and burned it on baker beach with larry harvey they got the idea after they had attended baker beach solstice bonfires amp art soirees hosted by mary grauberger in the early 80s jerry james looked me and the cacophony society up in 1988 and asked for our help and by 1990 we were integrally involved in the baker beach party
5381006 three old white guys own the trademarks they all hate each others guts
5381007 all the great shit i did to make bm so great
5381008 really i happen to have very fond feelings with all the people i worked and played with over these years that span my experience of the extended guerilla theater run of this burning archetype and way beyond
5381009 its my judgement that its misplaced because i know that larry is trustworthy from 25 years of close friendship john mistrusts him and thats our difference of opinion
5381010 there is a lot of larry bashing and discrediting i never heard larry bash or discredit john but i get the impression from john that a part of his issue is he is not given due credit so i responded by giving acknowledgment
5381011 it also seems johns grudge with larry is because larry held onto his vision of his creation even as john tried rigorously to wrest it away johns vision was to shut it down after 96 because it was more responsibility than he could fathom and made his view clear that it was headed toward disaster
5381012 97 was a triumphant success that seemed to only make john more bitter
5381013 burning man has continued to grow in success because of larrys focus that started it and attracted cocaphony
5381014 taking back personal power from the consumer marketing machine of our modern times
5381015 larrys vision to change the world and i think hes making an impact
5381016 hatered is a strong emotion i asked larry how he felt and he told me he did not hate john nor michael
5381017 did anyone notice that on the 2 00 street there were only 3 or 4 music spaces this year
5381018 if youre doing business with a religious sunofabitch get it in writing his word isnt worth shit not with the good lord telling him how to fuck you on the deal
5381019 this not a question of cult worship here its simply a question of who does the name burning man belong to not being a lawyer i could only express my gut feelings on this as i elaborated prior i believe larry owned it as being the originator i retract my second guesses as to johns motivations perhaps im guilty of
5381020 i dont know flynn why does it always get left alone until it comes to that

5381035 were surrounded by all these really impressive projects i had spoken to a bunch of the people who were working on them and a lot of them were friends whom we had interacted with before and whom we had been inspired by ours was a young project in comparison with most
5381036 is to take what these existing people based extension systems already have going a strong force of extension officers meeting one on one with farmers and using video to take a one on one demonstration to many farmers
5381037 were taking the production of videos to the grass roots level to create something like a youtube or a netflix type of system where farmers are shown adopting better practices and other farmers who watch can say oh this is something i can trust because these farmers are my vicinity its creating a social network dynamic with video at the local level
5381038 and to show the others who are there as well as beyond what weve been up to and to see how we can expand what weve been doing
5381039 weve found that using this local support of a facilitator plus a community tv and dvd player we can improve the efficiency of extension officers by 10 times because they now have local support
5381040 adding video as a medium to the extension system seems like a no brainer
5381041 but at the same time we have to consider how video fits in with that existing extension system there are lots of variables you can try to see what connects best with a community who should we feature within the videos an outside expert from a university might be able to give a great lecture but the farmers might not be receptive to it they want to hear from people in the local vicinity who can give them that motivational factor
5381042 the extension system would rely on contacting the bigger more progressive farmers who were willing to listen to these extension officers
5381043 just like anyone else farmers are more receptive to listening to people from their own vicinity whom they can trust as someone who faces the same resource constraints as they do some farmers are even incentivized to appear on tv to be featured as a better farmer were taking the information already being exchanged at the village level to involve a greater part of the community
5381044 educating farmers about better agricultural practices and technologies is crucial for developing countries
5381045 obviously its a very time consuming and logically challenging task especially in india to reach such a vast population that is so diverse in terms of cropping systems cultures and socioeconomic situations across the country
5381046 rajesh was just coming off a project to use a sms short message service based system to help manage the internal operations of a sugar cane cooperative in the indian state of maharashtra
5381047 rajesh was interested in trying to see how technology can be applied to agriculture in india the sms based project was mostly addressing higher income farmers who were members of the sugar cane cooperative and he wanted to see how we could apply video based media that he saw being pretty successful in the educational domain for agriculture particularly for subsistence small holder agriculture
5381048 thats how i got started working on developing digital green from its inception
5381049 figuring out how to be receptive to the interests and real use of this media for farmers to apply on their fields
5381050 were working with nonprofits in other places in india to see how the system integrates within different types of environments
5381051 the next three states were looking at are maharashtra chhattisgarh and jharkhand were trying to extend the model toward the northeastern parts of india where there are even higher levels of poverty we want to see how the system functions in poorer regions where it could have a larger impact
5381052 were at the phase where weve seen a very significant impact of digital green
5381053 a factor of 10 improvement per dollar spent in the effectiveness of the agricultural extension system the next step is to take it to the next level and try to partner with organizations across south asia and africa organizations that are already trying to reach farmers and are facing resource constraints and difficulties connecting with farmers digital green has both social as well as technology based elements
5381054 especially of the farmers themselves as they come out to view these videos and to be featured in videos

5381173 do not bring in bombay 92 or gujarat 2002 as these backlashes were not against terrorist attacks
5381174 it cannot be excluded that yesterdays atrocity in mumbai was organized or facilitated by agents provocateurs working for one of indias intelligence agencies or that elements within the security forces allowed the terrorist attack to take place with the aim of panicking the public into accepting increased repressive powers for the state it is also possible that the mumbai bombings were the work of hindu supremacist fanatics bent on stoking up anti muslim violence

5381610 some seem to believe we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along
5381611 we have heard this foolish delusion before as nazi tanks crossed into poland in 1939 an american senator declared lord if only i could have talked to hitler all of this might have been avoided we have an obligation to call this what it is the false comfort of appeasement which has been repeatedly discredited by history
5381612 we must not negotiate with a terrorist group intent on israels destruction
5381613 the problem with tim russert wasnt found in the questions he asked the problem was found in the answers he accepted
5381614 i serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views
5381615 s ome of those in the so called counter culture of the sixties reacted not merely by criticizing particular government policies but by attacking the symbols and in extreme cases the very idea of america itself by burning flags by blaming america for all that was wrong with the world and perhaps most tragically by failing to honor those veterans coming home from vietnam something that remains a national shame to this day
5381616 who led a movement to help america confront our tragic history of racial injustice and live up to the meaning of our creed he was a patriot
5381617 patriotism is merely a religion love of country worship of country devotion to the countrys flag and honor and welfare
5381618 in absolute monarchies it is furnished from the throne cut and dried to the subject in england and america it is furnished cut and dried to the citizen by the politician and the newspaper
5381619 the newspaper and politician manufactured patriot often gags in private over his dose but he takes it and keeps it on his stomach the best he can blessed are the meek
5381620 sometimes in the beginning of an insane and shabby political upheaval he is strongly moved to revolt but he doesnt do it he knows better
5381621 yet it was not a thing to be very seriously ashamed of a man can seldom very very seldom fight a winning fight against his training the odds are too heavy for many a year perhaps always the training of the two nations had been dead against independence in political thought persistently inhospitable toward patriotism manufactured on a mans own premises patriotism reasoned out in the mans own head and fire assayed and tested and proved in his own conscience the resulting patriotism was a shop worn product procured at second hand the patriot did not know just how or when or where he got his opinions neither did he care so long as he was with what seemed the majority which was the main thing the safe thing the comfortable thing does the reader believe he knows three men who have actual reasons for their pattern of patriotism and can furnish them let him not examine unless he wants to be disappointed he will be likely to find that his men got their patriotism at the public trough and had no hand in their preparation themselves
5381622 after all throughout our history men and women of far greater stature and significance than me have had their patriotism questioned in the midst of momentous debates thomas jefferson was accused by the federalists of selling out to the french the anti federalists were just as convinced that john adams was in cahoots with the british and intent on restoring monarchal rule likewise even our wisest presidents have sought to justify questionable policies on the basis of patriotism adams alien and sedition act lincolns suspension of habeas corpus roosevelts internment of japanese americans all were defended as expressions of patriotism and those who disagreed with their policies were sometimes labeled as unpatriotic
5381623 of course precisely because america isnt perfect precisely because our ideals constantly demand more from us patriotism can never be defined as loyalty to any particular leader or government or policy
5381624 patriotism is supporting your country all the time and your government when it deserves it

5381686 my goal is to help you inject some innovation into the work you do
5381687 its really hard to notice other things if you keep your eye on the ball you need to focus to get your work done but you might miss things that come out of left field its really hard to balance that
5381688 we can be paralyzed by fear as well fear of failure is probably the biggest impediment to innovation
5381689 theyre rebels theyre difficult to deal with sometimes theyre not always fun to have around
5381690 its important that you as a leader embrace the irritant
5381691 when you try to manage it you actually kill it
5381692 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
5381693 phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that
5381694 we think going forward the phone of the future will be differentiated by software
5381695 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull

5381699 airlines are looking to take fixed costs out wherever they can
5381700 if a lounge is being used three four or five times a day for only a small number of passengers it just makes prudent sense to stop paying for it in this high cost environment can i continue to offer all amenities to all people when im not being compensated
5381701 it is easy to underestimate the power that exists in lots of little actions
5381702 the lounge needs to be in the same terminal as the traveler
5381703 business travelers cant fritter away time schlepping from one terminal to another
5381704 the liberty of each of us to pursue our own dreams
5381705 patriotism is supporting your country all the time and your government when it deserves it

5381708 by the end of the day if the weather cooperates we can probably get all of our tourists out of there
5381709 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5381710 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5381711 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5381712 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5381713 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5381714 we dont want people to focus on the exact track this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5381715 we want every every floridian and guest to be a survivor
5381716 i know its only a tropical storm but we take it seriously
5381717 everybody seems to be acting like this is a non event
5381718 i think that the rape of a small child 6 or 8 years old is a heinous crime and if a state makes a decision under narrow limited well defined circumstances that the death penalty is at least potentially applicable that does not violate our constitution
5381719 but it basically had a blanket prohibition and i disagree with the decision
5381720 and thus have not been free to express their own understanding of our societys standards of decency
5381721 i think if someone gets caught abusing a kid they should be rounded up and killed case closed
5381722 yeah i thought i was talking to you but clearly you believe i should only speak to people who are paid 150 an hour to hear about this shit i guess you dont understand that its tough for me to trust strangers particularly strangers who sit there and only say hmm every 15 or twenty minutes it can be kind of nerve wracking after you do that it could be kind of nice to speak to a trusted friend
5381723 i hope this response was simply a matter of political expediency for the democratic candidate
5381724 while the evidence tells me that the death penalty does little to deter crime i believe there are some crimes mass murder the rape and murder of a child so heinous so beyond the pale that the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage by meting out the ultimate punishment
5381725 hansen said recent studies have shown that nano sized particles in some
5381726 crude foundation of a whole new global platform for collaboration
5381727 never before in the history of the planet have so many people on their own had the ability to find so much information about so many things and about so many other people
5381728 now processing roughly one billion searches per day up from 150 million just three years ago
5381729 despite talk of a new wired world where information ideas money and people can move around the planet faster than ever before just a fraction of what we consider globalization actually exists
5381730 what really stands out is the absence of the middle man
5381731 i think to inform each other is the crucial piece of business
5381732 playing an active role in the process of collecting reporting analyzing and disseminating news and information
5381733 we media how audiences are shaping the future of news and information
5381734 what became known as citizen journalism is the result of the digital eras democratization of media
5381735 who coined this term and when it entered the mainstream media
5381736 jays definition is about defining the activity and not its relationship to the media
5381737 employ the press tools they have in their possession to inform one another
5381738 designed to help publishers and editors understand citizen journalism and how it might be incorporated into their web sites and legacy media
5381739 when the people formerly known as christians employ the spiritual gifts they have been given to reach the lost thats missional evangelism
5381740 when the people formerly known as the audience employ the press tools they have in their possession to inform many others of a newsworthy event thats citizen journalism
5381741 jay is this definition the first step in clealy articulating citizen journalism as a journalistic philosophy in its own right it would be nice
5381742 this is a crappy newspaper that cat picture would never pass any editorial scrutiny
5381743 employ the press tools they have in their possession to inform one another
5381744 when the people formerly known as the audience employ the press tools they have been given to inform each other thats citizen journalism
5381745 freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one
5381746 employ those press tools to which they have access to inform one another
5381747 freedom to use the words citizen journalism is guaranteed the most to those who own the url
5381748 journalism is something done by journalists or printed in news publications
5381749 when the people formerly known as the audience employ the press tools they have in their possession to inform many others of a newsworthy event thats citizen journalism
5381750 here is one advantage bloggers have in the struggle for reputation for the users trust they are closer to the transaction where trust gets built up on the web theres a big difference between tapping a built up asset like the st pete times brand and creating it from scratch
5381751 you dont own the eyeballs you dont own the press which is now divided into pro and amateur zones you dont control production on the new platform which isnt one way theres a new balance of power between you and us
5381752 howard weaver vice president for news at the mcclatchy company said it comes as close as anything ive seen to a roadmap for the near future
5381753 just so you know the media has no mind it cannot make decisions which means it does not get behind candidates it does not decide to oppose your guy or gal it is a beast without a brain most of the time it doesnt know what its doing
5381754 im just advising newsroom joe and jill make room for fdl in your own ideas about whats coming on news wise dont let your own formula blog opinion fake you out a conspiracy of the like minded to find out what happened when the national news media isnt inclined to tell us might be way more practical than you think
5381755 were at the twilight of the curmudgeon class in newsrooms and j schools though they can still do a lot of damage you know theyre giving up when they no longer bother to inform themselves about what they themselves say is happening
5381756 the important thing is to show integrity not to be a neuter politically and having good facts that hold up is a bigger advantage than claiming to reflect all sides equally well
5381757 enterprise reporting goes pro am assignments are open sourced they begin online reporters working with smart users and blogging editors get the story the pack wouldnt couldnt or didnt
5381758 newassignment net just launched its first reporting project a partnership with wired com and newsvine its called assignment zero heres the deal and the links
5381759 a highly satisfying failure jeff howe called it in wired no a spectacularly successful failure says beth lawton at the digital edge meanwhile offthebus net launched this week carrying the lessons of zero into political space
5381760 here are my coordinates for the territory we need to be searching i got them from doing a distributed trend story with wired com and thinking through the results
5381761 this white house doesnt settle for managing the news what used to be called feeding the beast because there is a larger aim to roll back the press as a player within the executive branch to make it less important in running the white house and governing the country
5381762 youre assuming that you represent the public i dont accept that
5381763 bush and his advisors have their own press think which they are trying out as policy reporters do not represent the interests of a broader public they arent a pipeline to the people because people see through the game of gotcha the press has forfeited if it ever had its quasi official role in the checks and balances of government
5381764 savviness that quality of being shrewd practical well informed perceptive ironic with it and unsentimental in all things political is in a sense their professional religion they make a cult of it and it was this cult that karl rove understood and exploited for political gain
5381765 were headed i think for schism tumult and divide as the religion of the american press meets the upheavals in global politics and public media that are well underway changing around us are the terms on which authority can be established by journalists the net is opening things up shifting the power to publish around consumers are becoming producers readers can be writers
5381766 some of the pressure the blogs are putting on journalists shows up then in the demand for
5381767 theyre not equals but washington and arlington have their own spheres over the newspaper and reporting beats len downie is king over the website jim brady is sovereign over the user s experience no one has total control theres tension because theres supposed to be tension
5381768 an industry that wont move until it is certain of days as good as its golden past is effectively dead from a strategic point of view besides there is an alternative if you dont have the faith or will or courage needed to accept reality and deal the alternative is to drive the property to a profitable demise
5381769 so while people in the old press pack up and tell stories about giants they knew in the era when they are also asking each other where headed
5381770 mcclellan bush cheney and rove proved there were other ways
5381771 woodward and bernstein of 1972 74 didnt have such access and this probably influenced for the better their view of what nixon and his men were capable of watergate wasnt broken by reporters who had entree to the inner corridors of power it was two guys on the metro desk
5381772 just one mans opinion but now is a good time to say it the new york times is not any longer in my mind the greatest newspaper in the land nor is it the base line for the public narrative that it once was some time in the last year or so i moved the washington post into that position
5381773 this here is a post for practically everyone in the game of seizing on media bias and denouncing it which is part of our popular culture and of course a loud part of our politics and this is especially for the were fair and balanced youre not crowd wherever i may have located you
5381774 the posts links dont expire you see links to the new york times do
5381775 oreilly feeds off his own resentments the establishment sneering at inside edition and like howard beale the mad prophet of the airwaves his resentments are enlarged by the medium into public grievances among a mass of americans unfairly denied voice
5381776 dan rather and cbs took the risky course impunging the motives of critics rather than a more confident and honorable one lets look at our sources and methods what can explain such a blind reaction here is my attempt
5381777 occupy the reasonable middle between two markers for vocal critic and critics look ridiculous charging you with bias their symmetrical existence feels like proof of an underlying hysteria their mutually incompatible charges seem to cancel each other out the minute evidence they marshall even shows a touch of fanaticism
5381778 among foreign correspondents there is a phrase parachuting in thats when a reporter drops into foreign territory during an emergency without much preparation staying only as long as the story remains big the high profile people who might parachute in are called bigfoots in the jargon of network news the problem with being a bigfoot of course is that its hard to walk in other peoples shoes
5381779 the bias charges are getting more serious lately as the stakes rise in iraq and the election but there is something lacking in press coverage and it may be time for wise journalists to assess it the re building story has gone missing and without it how can we judge the job bush is doing
5381780 there are hidden moral hazards in the ethic of neutral observation and the belief in a professional role that transcends other loyalties i think there is an abyss to observation alone and i feel it has something to do with why more people dont trust journalists they dont trust that abyss
5381781 find some new information and put it into your post
5381782 opinion based on information everyone has is less valuable than opinion journalism based on information that you dug up originated or pieced together so its not important to us that contributors keep opinion
5381783 what capacity for product development do news organizations show zip how are they on nurturing innovation terrible is there an entreprenurial spirit in newsrooms no do smart young people ever come in and overturn everything never
5381784 number one is the houston chronicle number two the washington post theres more and theres a big chart so check it out more
5381785 i think the happiest conference goers at blogher were probably the newbies people who want to start blogging or just did they got a lot of good information and advice some of the best information was actually dispensed in response to the fears provoked by blogging which shouldn t be avoided the sages said but examined turned around defused and creatively shrunk
5381786 the weblog comes out of the gift economy whereas most of today s journalism comes out of the market economy
5381787 the quality of any weblog in journalism depends greatly on its fidelity to age old newsroom commandments like check facts check links spell things correctly be accurate be timely quote fairly
5381788 sure weblogs are good for making statements big and small but they also force re statement yes theyre opinion forming but they are equally good at unforming opinion breaking it down stretching it out
5381789 when youre sitting at your desk and there are things strange wonderful and new on your screen you may have to re decide what journalism is and is finally about in order to cover the new class of cases that arise when youre doing it live online
5381790 its pirate radio legalized its public access coming closer to life inside the borders of blogistan a real place with all the problems of a real place were closer to a vision of producer democracy than we are to any of the consumerist views that long ago took hold in the mass media including much of the journalism presented on that platform
5381791 and big media doesnt entirely own the press because if it did then the first amendment which mentions the press would belong to big media and it doesnt these things were always true the weblog doesnt change them it just opens up an outlet to the sea which in turn extends the press to the desk in the bedroom of the suburban mom where she blogs at night
5381792 journalists think good information leads to opinion and argument its a logical sequence bloggers think that good argument and strong opinion cause people to seek information an equally logical sequence what do the bloggers bring to this my short answer to the press is everything you have removed
5381793 journalists you can stop worrying about bloggers replacing the traditional news media were grist for their mill says satullo a mill that doesnt run without us bloggers consume and extend the shelf life of our reporting and they scrutinize it at a new level of intensity
5381794 the web is good for many opposite things for quick hitting information for clicking across a field for talk and interaction its also a depth finder a memory device a library an editor not to use a weblog for extended analysis because most users wont pick that option is web dumb but media smart whats strange is that i try to write short snappy things but they turn into long ones
5381795 i remember the moment when presidential campaigns turned from just maddening and absurd to completely empty for me it might have happened years before but i am a believer in politics so it took until the fall of 2000 bush and gore were then fighting it out not by opposing one another in any kind of argument but by running virtually the same campaign on the same issues pandering to the same groups advancing a rhetoric that sounded the same but for a few catch phrases
5381796 somehow it had all gotten away from them presidential campaigns had drifted out of alignment with most americans the ritual no longer seemed like something the country did for itself every four years but what a professional cadre did and sold back to the country as politics but it wasn t really at least it wasn t democratic politics at anything like capacity
5381797 were winning to somehow be removed or retired as the operating system for news campaign reporting would immediately become harder to do not because there would be no news but rather no common repeatable instructions for deciding what is a key development in the story a turning point a surprise a trend master narratives are thus harder to alter than they are to apprehend for how do you keep the story running while a switch is made
5381798 spin alley an invention of the american press and politicos shows that the system we have is in certain ways a partnership between the press and insiders in politics they come together to mount the ritual an intelligent nation is entitled to ask if the partners are engaged in public service when they bring to life their invention alternative thesis they are in a pact of mutual convenience that serves no intelligible public good
5381799 how is it you know youre the press because you have a pass that says press and people open the gate the locker room doors admit you
5381800 the answer i think involves an open secret in political journalism that has been recognized for at least 20 years but it is never dealt with probably because the costs of facing it head on seem larger than the light tax on honesty any open secret demands the secret is this pssst the press is a player in the campaign and even though it knows this as everyone knows it the professional code of the journalist contains no instructions in what the press could or should be playing for
5381801 i think its a bankrupt form it serves no clear purpose has no sensible rationale the journalists who offer us strategy news do not know what public service they are providing why they are providing it for whom it is intended or how we are supposed to use this strange variety of news
5381802 when journalists avoid drawing open conclusions they are more vulnerable to charges of covert bias of having a concealed agenda of not being up front about their perspective of unfairly building a case for against while pretending only to report what happened

5381852 the idea that taking the most important product and reducing the amount of news and getting rid of staff to me seems pointless to how you should run a newspaper business

5381866 but newspapers are essentially a logistics business that happens to employ journalists thats why newspapers didnt invent google
5381867 edward reasoned that google already is the key distributor online he said that google is great at technology and newspapers arent and for the future where are the best technologists going to go google google is also brilliant at selling ads and edward even wondered where the best sales talent would go in the future there or a paper so why not hand over those segments of the business to google and concentrate on what a newspaper should do journalism
5381868 do what you do best and link to the rest
5381869 the issue is newspapers trying to build their own web platforms with technology that is inferior
5381870 journalism is just the sideshow to attract an audience to attract the constantly declining ad revenue
5381871 whether its google or someone else the idea is right newspapers should concentrate on what the are supposed to do and stop trying to differentiate themselves with technology

5381873 outsource the copyediting to india or to ughhh thought provoking ideas but i cant get around to accepting them a few contentious thoughts come to mind first the natural consequence of the arguments would have google control monopolizing newspapers printing and distribution and advertising platforms doesnt it strike anybody that maybe just maybe this is too much power on anybodys hands google will play with most of the cards why wouldnt it impose reduced sales commissions and salaries to journalists where else would the sales people and journalists go to work under such a monopoly in the same vein why would any newspaper owner get into such a dead end alley then as someone has already commented technology is moving in leaps and bounds it gets easier and easier for the end users jounalists just think of how easy it is to setup a newspaper around a blog in order to solve the problem that is diminishing the printed newspaper role we must understand it i think it boils down to two main issues 1 technology has allowed companies to advertise themselves inexpensively any company can setup an attractive website for a couple of 000s which combined with the ease of searching makes it an extremely inexpensive way to reach their potential buyers and even sell directly eroding the old newspaper exclusivity there are literally millions of websites catering to consumers and competing with newspapers 2 again someone already touched the subject of journalism excellence and integrity unfortunately this has not received the business value it deserves newspaper managers cater over and over to circulation numbers not quality journalism if people stop believing in the god then advertisers will shy away from the totem where they used to hang their ads the quality reliability assurance effect is no longer there to trickle down to their companies hence the ads have little advertising value left to them buzzmachine blog archive googles first step as a paper platform july 23rd 2008 at 6 04 pm other day and again in my upcoming guardian column i quoted telegraph digital head edward roussel speculating about shifting his papers platforms buzzmachine blog archive guardian column a new news platform july 23rd 2008 at 6 14 pm guardian column this week reprises the discussion from my post about google as the new pressroom and then adds some thoughts about news organizations sharing open source platforms snippet the digital buzzmachine blog archive google as the new pressroom july 25th 2008 at 5 57 am buzzmachine blog archive google as the new pressroom var disqus url http marshalsandler com p 4183 var disqus title buzzmachine blog archive google as the new pressroom var disqus message buzzmachine blog archive google as the new pressroom 0a view the entire comment thread i hope im not skipping over somebodys whose already suggested this analogy make newspaper companies like real estate companies realtors are independent contractors who pay the company for infrastructural support and get a commission from the clients advertisers could pay the commissions to the best performing or their favorite news writers who could then pay the newspaper companies for the information gathering support this would encourage good reporting however thats defined by different advertisers and the public in the end who buys what the advertisers are paying to promote the newspapers could then outsource the distribution as real estate companies do usually to local title companies who create flyers and print brochures google could easily certainly be a main online distributor integrate horizontally instead of vertically indeed as way up there in the comments newspaper companies would be the keeper and creator of connections a worthy purpose zomerschool crossmedia terugblik deel 1 jaap stronks onderwijsblog july 25th 2008 at 1 10 pm een belangrijk inzicht is dat journalisten niet langer distributeur zijn zie bijvoorbeeld google as the new press newsroom maar eigenlijk ook your corporate homepage is really google com nieuws is niet langer what will really be the official news 2 0 glowrich on new media july 27th 2008 at 3 53 pm 10th of july 2008 jeff jarvis has another thought provoking post on newspapers his point is that they should make their mind up about what they are journalist and july 28th 2008 at 11 25 am today the daily telegraph anounced their change from ms to google http www macworld co uk business news index cfm rss amp newsid 22077 july 28th 2008 at 11 54 am 2008 benjamin birkenhake hat mich per mail auf den recht lesenswerten artikel von jeff jarvis google as the new pressroom hingewiesen im artikel sagt jarvis dass die verlage im falschen gesch ft sind zeitungen und lsdi giornali perch non lasciare a google la diffusione dei contenuti e concentrarsi sul giornalismo ipotesi per una nuova economia delle redazioni del futuro july 29th 2008 at 1 19 am patto

5382004 novell is not entitled to any of the revenue sco received under the 2003 microsoft agreement
5382005 sco renegotiated a contract and expanded suns rights to svrx technology still owned by novell and sco improperly received the money for granting such right even though those rights remained with novell
5382006 could not return the parties to the same position they were in prior to the 2003 agreement sun has already received the benefits of the agreement and developed and marketed a product based on those benefits there was also evidence at trial that opensolaris directly competed with novells interest the court therefore cannot merely void the contract
5382007 we continue to disagree with the premise of this trial and believe that novell is not owed anything but that they have interfered with scos unix rights
5382008 we have developed a balanced plan that provides new options for customers while continuing to dedicate our efficient legacy generating assets to our ohio retail customers

5382014 we used to have alta vista and that was it for search
5382015 if it were true that older kids are able to learn at a faster rate then the differences in test scores should get bigger as kids progress and the material gets more difficult but we really see the opposite
5382016 kids learn at lot before kindergarten especially if theyre in preschool one way to think about it is that the oldest kid in kindergarten has about 20 percent more life experience
5382017 but once they start they basically learn at the same rate
5382018 older kids may do better at first but theres a tradeoff
5382019 theyre also a year in school behind other kids their own age at the end of the line somehow that year will catch up to them they start work a year later and parents have an extra year of child care costs if they delay entry so its not free
5382020 what we think is going on is that teachers are comparing younger kids to older classmates and the younger kids tend to stand out
5382021 they stand out either as not doing as well or they tend to stand out as being more hyperactive
5382022 older kids do better at first and younger kids do worse but they catch up
5382023 the thing is schools are making profound decisions based on these differences differences that tend to fade away
5382024 its clear the pattern is these academic differences get smaller as kids get older
5382025 it doesnt seem reasonable to us that there could be large long term gains from starting kindergarten at an older age when there isnt much of an effect for kids in eighth grade
5382026 whether they go to school earlier or later thats really not going to matter much at the end of the day
5382027 coming out soon that talks about how to design and validate these kinds of heterogeneous platforms dave is likewise not beholden to one ideal platform or solution

5382029 i wanted to come in strong and stay focused i knew johnny was going to be right on me so i wanted to finish strong and keep my composure plus i wanted us to go 1 2 and bring some medals back
5382030 it was a decent race i cant say good race it wasnt my best race i clipped one of the hurdles and usually i never touch a hurdle so then i alternated on one of the last hurdles and thats another thing i never do i tried my best and the best man won today
5382031 nothing really crossed my mind as i finished i just wanted to hurry up and get done with the race im glad we finished 1 2 im really appreciative about that
5382032 i just wanted to stay relaxed on the anchor leg and keep the lead so we could bring home some medals i was still a little too tight from the 400 hurdles
5382033 after this long season im so happy to finish it with this victory this was a great experience its my first world team and i hope it wont be my last i ran my best today
5382034 we were going for the record so we wanted to run our hardest even out front
5382035 people will stay in a difficult situation as long as they feel like there is hope

5382051 comprehensive wiretap system that intercepts wire line phones cellular phones sms and push to talk systems
5382052 so little has been known up until now about how dcs works
5382053 this is why its so important for foia requesters to file lawsuits for information they really want
5382054 before calea it was a rudimentary system that mimicked ma bell
5382055 it is fair to say we can do push to talk
5382056 all of the carriers are living up to their responsibilities under calea
5382057 the real question is the switch architecture on cell networks
5382058 nothing ever gets connected or disconnected until i say so based upon a court order in our hands
5382059 we run the interception process off of my desk and we track them coming in we give instructions to relevant field people who allow for interconnection and to make verbal connections with technical representatives at the fbi
5382060 the carriers have legal teams to read the order and they have procedures in place to review the court orders and they also verify the information and that the target is one of their subscribers
5382061 i know of no issue of compromise internal or external
5382062 the underlying problem isnt so much the weaknesses here as the fbi attitude towards security
5382063 to the extent that inside threats exist they can be controlled by process rather than technology
5382064 im not saying dont do wiretaps but when you start designing a system to be wiretappable you start to create a new vulnerability a wiretap is by definition a vulnerability from the point of the third party the question is can you control it

5382071 a lengthy and far reaching process throughout the state and defense departments and other agencies
5382072 while weve all seen progress in some areas especially on the security front its not surprising the gao would make this assessment given the difficult congressionally mandated measurement they had to follow
5382073 prospects for additional progress in enacting legislative benchmarks have been complicated by the withdrawal of 15 of 37 members of the iraqi cabinet
5382074 this boycott ends any claim by the coalition to be a government of national unity
5382075 the average number of daily attacks against civilians remained about the same over the last six months 25 in february versus 26 in july
5382076 some army units sent to baghdad have mixed loyalties and some have had ties to shiia militias making it difficult to target shiia extremist networks
5382077 although we still have a ways to go iraqi security forces are making significant tangible improvements
5382078 the problems that the military commanders and the minister of defense have here in generating the iraqi army are very significant and they shouldnt be taken lightly

5382115 in autoimmune diseases such as arthritis we discovered that cytokines are over produced causing the immune system to fight itself resulting in inflammation and tissue destruction
5382116 we further found that by blocking just one cytokine tumor necrosis factor tnf alpha we were able to block all the cytokines involved in the inflammation with remarkable clinical results
5382117 during the conference i will be discussing the potential therapeutic targets in tissue affected by atherosclerosis which is caused by a chronic inflammatory response in the walls of the arteries in large part caused by an excessive immune response to cholesterol
5382118 i will also discuss whether it is possible even likely that cytokines play a critical role in all diseases involving multiple biological processes thus providing therapeutic targets for all unmet medical needs

5382123 months of unfair treatment that has created a harmful distraction at the justice department
5382124 its sad that we live in a time when a talented and honorable person like alberto gonzales is impeded from doing important work because his good name was dragged through the mud for political reasons
5382125 everybody came to the conclusion that it was not possible to sustain a positive proactive agenda at the department of justice with all the distractions
5382126 be in the best interests of the department that he resign
5382127 i think the attorney generals assessment was that all of the investigations were a distraction that was harmful to the department
5382128 after much thought and consideration i believe this is the right time for my family and i to begin a new chapter in our lives
5382129 my own view is that the replacement of the attorney general with an objective credentialed strong individual is a very good solution
5382130 i have to modify what the president said that he didnt do anything wrong

5382147 we hope that these data encourage physicians to use clinical remission as a new standard for evaluating symptom control in the treatment of early ra
5382148 clinical remission is highly relevant to patients daily lives as they cope with their symptoms
5382149 its important for people living with a chronic disease like moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis to be able to continue with their daily life activities
5382150 these data show that if patients receive combination treatment early they are more likely to be able to continue with their daily activities including going to work than those treated with methotrexate alone

5382153 it is high time now that muslims in europe pressed for their rights like enacting laws banning aggression on islam and enhancing islamic education
5382154 freedom of religion is non negotiable it is a fundamental right of individuals and communities and entails respect for the integrity of all religious convictions and all ways in which they are exercised similarly freedom of expression is central to europes values and traditions it is also non negotiable but it does come with responsibilities and should be exercised with the necessary sensitivity to others
5382155 the insult of prophets in the name of freedom of speech is a crime which cannot be ignored we therefore ask the european union to adopt laws to prohibit that kind of insults

5382182 nobody disputes the truism that autism results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors
5382183 go home and accept it its genetic all you can do it adapt your house and your life you cant do much for your child
5382184 modern medical evidence suggests clear biological causes for autism and this has meant that parents no longer need to blame themselves
5382185 the exact cause of autistic spectrum disorders is still not known but research shows that genetic factors are important in some cases autistic spectrum disorders may also be associated with conditions affecting brain development such as maternal rubella tuberous sclerosis and encephalitis
5382186 the position of the nas less than 6 years ago was to ignore totally environmental factors
5382187 an autistic spectrum disorder is a lifelong disability and there is at present no one effective treatment that appears to work for everyone however the situation is not as bleak as this must at first appear given appropriate intervention early in life specialised education and structuredsupport can really make a difference to a childs life helping to maximise their skills and achieve their full potential as adults

5382211 but as you know its actually the show moves back and forth in time so we have the opportunity to use you know ted and actors in ways that are not conventional so we love arthur frobisher and were very excited to try to find a way to keep that character his presence in the show
5382212 it led us to having serialized stories and not plots that end each episode a case each episode because its not to us really about the cases its about what the case in the first season the frobisher case what it does to our people its putting high powered people in extremely intense situations of a crucible and seeing how they respond and pushing people to the limits

5382245 the 2009 nissan gt r isnt for me there i said it ive come clean the holy grail of new performance cars the great nissan gt r isnt my thing man what a load off my chest now before you threaten my kids let me explain fact is ive now driven three different gt rs a total of 2 200 miles which probably means i have more miles in a gt r than any other american and i have no hesitation calling it the best performance car you can buy at any price sure the steering is unnecessarily heavy the ride is ridiculously harsh and the engine is just too damn quiet but this is an amazing machine pure speed if going fast is your goal the nissan gt r is the car to have trouble is there are several cars on the market for the same money that also go way too fast but offer more luxury more prestige and more fun they are in no particular order the mercedes benz c63 the bmw m3 the porsche 911 and a well used but well preserved ferrari f355 although none of those cars can really run with the almighty gt r each is capable of sub 5 second 0 to 60 mph times 12 second quarter mile runs and enough g load to cause a redout theyre also more luxurious more livable and far more impressive to members of the opposite sex most of whom would see the gt r and wonder why you put that big ugly wing on your 300zx then theres the hooligan factor sometimes having a fast car isnt only about speed sometimes its about fun and the gt r with its very sophisticated all wheel drive system gets a big fat zero in this category powerslides and burnouts arent really in the vocabulary sure its fun to use its launch mode and leave the world behind but most of the time id rather shave a little life off my rear tires dont get your pocket protector in a bunch i know burnouts and powerslides are slow but there are times when i prefer blazing the tires through a couple of gears or a good old fashioned powerslide to all out speed such recklessness always makes me smile and nobody is timing me in the real world rarely do i try to shave a tenth of a second on my way to costco which brings me back to the gt r its a serious performance machine maybe a little too serious i prefer cars with a lighter side cars with a second dimension cars with a little less to prove even if they are slower around the n rburging theyre usually more fun

5382255 i am delighted to announce the completion of this exciting merger between sirius and xm
5382256 we have worked diligently to close this transaction and we look forward to integrating our best in class management teams and operations so we can begin delivering on our promise of more choices and lower prices for subscribers
5382257 every one of our constituencies is a winner combined sirius xm radio will deliver superior value to our shareholders by offering more compelling packages and the best content in audio entertainment we are well positioned for increased subscriber growth our laser focus on subscribers will continue and listeners can be assured that there will be no disruption in service we also believe that the completion of the merger will eliminate any confusion that has been lingering in the marketplace
5382258 one of the most exciting benefits of this transaction is the ability to offer subscribers the option of expanding their subscriptions to include the best of both services given the respective popularity of exclusive programming on both sirius and xm we expect many subscribers will upgrade their current subscription
5382259 the upside potential for both consumers and shareholders is huge consumers have the ease of adding premier programming without purchasing a new device for shareholders this kind of organic growth is a key part of the companys future and the success we expect to see
5382260 in addition to realizing significant potential revenue growth the management team will move quickly to capitalize on the synergies that many analysts have predicted for this combination we expect to begin achieving those synergies without sacrificing any of the world class programming and marketing we are known for
5382261 we have all the tools necessary to begin executing as a combined company with high aspirations for subscriber growth and greater financial performance in part from the significant synergies that we begin realizing literally today on day one we are moving quickly to integrate the operations

5382266 the comet trial showed that patients who received combination therapy have a nearly three fold reduction in work stoppage compared with those who took high dose methotrexate alone the ability to remain a productive member of the workforce has implications for patients employers and society as a whole the effect of ra is especially significant for women aged 55 64 years because they have a high incidence of stopping work early nearly a quarter of patients who were in employment at baseline in the comet trial had stopped working at least once by the end of 1 year compared with about a tenth in the combination group
5382267 the results of the comet trial suggest that remission is an achievable goal in patients with early severe ra within the first year of therapy with etanercept plus methotrexate the positive clinical outcomes in the combination treatment group also seem to determine the ability of patients to remain in employment furthermore these outcomes appear to be achieved without exposing patients to significant additional risk

5382278 to designate a protest area where demonstrators can be placed preferably not in the view of the event site or motorcade route
5382279 that the white house has a policy of excluding and or attempting to squelch dissenting viewpoints from presidential events
5382280 individuals should have the right to express their opinion to the president even if its not a favorable one
5382281 at least one squad should be roaming throughout the perimeter of the event to look for potential problems
5382282 these squads should be instructed always to look for demonstrators
5382283 the rally squads task is to use their signs and banners as shields between the demonstrators and the main press platform if the demonstrators are yelling rally squads can begin and lead supportive chants to drown out the protestors usa usa usa as a last resort security should remove the demonstrators from the event site
5382284 if it is determined that the media will not see or hear them and that they pose no potential disruption to the event they can be ignored on the other hand if the group is carrying signs trying to shout down the president or has the potential to cause some greater disruption to the event action needs to be taken immediately to minimize the demonstrators effect
5382285 remember avoid physical contact with demonstrators most often the demonstrators want a physical confrontation do not fall into their trap
5382286 decide if the solution would cause more negative publicity than if the demonstrators were simply left alone

5382317 yes we have plenty of money we have enough money to spend but were not going to splash out stupidly we could spend more but were not going to pay silly money for a player that is only going to strengthen the squad a bit if they might win you the champions league thats a different matter but no one is a better judge than arsene

5382325 we are prepared to do whatever it takes to win a football game in respect of a football game are we ready to kill someone to win a game no because you have to respect the rules in football the beauty in the game is to win in respect of the rules
5382326 can you win the league by playing completely non football i dont believe so historically it is proven that the teams who win the league are the better technical teams
5382327 the leading clubs have a responsibility to try to make the games attractive they can never be a long term target to play a dirty game or one which is not attractive
5382328 we want to play our game because we feel it is the most efficient way to win
5382329 i feel the player loses value if he is not eligible for the champions league
5382330 look just look at our squad and you show me one weakness one area where we are light
5382331 basically we balance the budget in the way we run the club
5382332 i have the money available to buy the players but we go into the competition with that target i think every manager should do this
5382333 we have gone three or four years into a different policy of bringing on our own players which we have to see through
5382334 but i am convinced we have opted for stability with young players who have spirit of our game the spirit of our club
5382335 and i believe we will show we are more united and that we have the needed belief to be successful that should be one of the advantages we have in this
5382336 i think you always want to buy the players at the right price
5382337 when you want to move a club forward as i think i have done here in the last 10 years some investment is needed not only to buy players but to spot players when they are not necessarily stars the quality of a manager is as well to develop players
5382338 for example when we bought adebayor who was thinking that he is a great player we bought him for what you can call at the time a reasonable price
5382339 but it is not necessarily linked with the price of the players it is linked with the how well the player develops how good he becomes and then you assess the situation of the player once he plays
5382340 manchester united are in the 20 30 million bracket of the market chelsea are in an unlimited bracket and we have to be in our own bracket reasonable but shrewd
5382341 of course i have made mistakes there are players i should have done but none at 30m
5382342 with ribery we had top class players in that position rosicky and hleb
5382343 so yes i have missed out on a couple of players in the past but frankly it hurts too much to tell you
5382344 but according to rumours both are concerned that arsenal have not been punching their weight in the transfer market this summer wengers reply do not believe the rumours adebayor has signed a lucrative new deal and f bregas is not about to leave
5382345 the job of the media is to imagine the worst and the job of the manager is to imagine the best so there is always a difference
5382346 if i go into a season and say for f ks sake if we dont win anything they will all leave we are already beaten

5382636 this important legislation boldly recognises that women and girls are at the centre of the global hiv epidemic
5382637 while far from perfect pepfar will significantly bolster the reach and effectiveness of the u s global aids programme and will strengthen its priority to women and girls laying out stronger measures to hold it accountable
5382638 social factors that exacerbate womens and girls risk of hiv infection
5382639 icrws research shows that when women and girls have access to education and economic resources such as the availability to earn a living or own their own homes or land remarkable changes occur in the lives as well as in their communities they are less likely to marry as children domestic violence diminishes they are less economically dependent on men and as a result vulnerability to hiv decreases
5382640 we are very disappointed that the final bill compromises women and girls rights to full information and services related to sexual and reproductive health this will ultimately undermine the effectiveness of the investments made to reduce womens vulnerability without stronger links between hiv programmes and comprehensive reproductive health information and services women will be short changed
5382641 is continuing to impose arbitrary funding directives to encourage abstinence only programmes over effective comprehensive prevention interventions
5382642 we deeply appreciate the hard work of everyone involved in the congress and the white house which has led to this crucial legislation yet in terms of funding it appears to more rhetoric than reality
5382643 president bush should also move to immediately implement the bills provisions such as by lifting immigration restrictions on people who are hiv positive

5382650 our goal is to protect the grande ronde aquifer which is the water source for pullman and moscow
5382651 the aquifer is threatened by over pumping and were trying to limit wsu so they cant expand their pumping
5382652 we believe the result of that ruling will limit water consolidation by wsu
5382653 i have a private well in the grande ronde just like wsu
5382654 my well is dropping about a foot per year and it will be affected it costs me a lot of money and i dont have the resources to deepen it like wsu does
5382655 they did not address the constitutionality of the 2003 municipal water law and we hope to explore it further in court
5382656 in the 2006 case we wanted to consolidate our water rights and we got the right to pump water from the wells
5382657 we felt the responsible thing to do was save the university money and the department of ecology approved
5382658 the department of ecology has been irresponsible in its assessment of how much water was available so theres a problem there
5382659 its a public interest issue because everyone who lives in pullman depends on this aquifer
5382660 it is a serious matter when it is dropping like this aquifer at an average rate of 1 5 ft per year
5382661 we exchanged documents and the golf course designer indicated it might be up to 130 million gallons
5382662 its a good amenity for faculty staff students and visitors
5382663 theres a certain amount of trade off in any kind of development water use is part of the picture
5382664 i know wsu likes to promote itself as an example of sustainability but theyre not walking their talk
5382665 they are engaging in a non sustainable use of the single most important resource to the community that being its water

5382687 its extremely important to have people like al gore who are pushing and pressing the edge of the envelope
5382688 but at this point i dont think theres anyone in the industry who thinks that goal as a practical matter could be met this is not yet a plan for action this is a superstretch goal

5382713 the specialty of rheumatology has made tremendous strides over the last 30 years when my father also a rheumatologist was practicing and aspirin was the standard treatment today the standard treatment for people living with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis includes disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs dmards and biologic therapies that inhibit specific proteins like tumor necrosis factor tnf
5382714 initiatives like generations will bring awareness to this serious illness which can affect entire families and in turn may give rheumatologists the opportunity to prevent the debilitating effects of ra
5382715 findings from the generations surveys provide interesting perspectives relative to both patient and physician insights

5382733 the continuing presence of a large dead zone highlights the need to implement ways to reduce the amount of nutrients coming from the mississippi river watershed which have contributed the dead zone growth in recent years
5382734 reducing nutrient pollution to protect coastal resources is one of the greatest ecosystem management challenges that we face nation wide
5382735 hurricane dollys winds and waves caused reaeration of parts of the dead zone especially along its western and shoreward edges just before measurements were taken

5382749 a major new academic exchange programme which will help to undermine attempts to boycott israeli universities
5382750 by birax choosing starting academics when the unions start discussing a boycott there will be more people who have had some contact with israel and will have some knowledge weve discovered that 80 percent of those who attend the union meetings dont know anything about israel or the issue so its sort of a value added element to the program

5382757 from this perspective the sincerity of our professions is tested by our behavior in these villages every intentional pressure aimed at uprooting the local population is tantamount to a planned act of eviction on our part
5382758 there is no doubt that here there is a calculated action aimed at increasing the number of those going to the hebron hills then controlled by jordan as if of their own free will and if possible to bring about the evacuation of the whole civilian population

5382760 my family felt it my wife bente said that i sometimes repeated myself and talked nonsense i am constantly tense when were out of the house i am almost paranoid and just want to get back home but i know i have protection and that does make me feel safer the thing is though that i feel i am wearing manacles
5382761 naser khader is a pig i hate naser khader fucking hypocrite he should be trampled to death naser khader doesnt care about us other moslems
5382762 even on a website as harmless as that i am smeared massively even by school children and thats my point that we are dealing with extremist imams who defer from encouraging violence and terror but when abu laban e g says that i am a rat why does he say that why doesnt he say that i am a pig its because rats are exterminated an imam in the south of jutland said that those who hate naser khader will go to paradise the imams do not directly encourage violence and terror but when they focus their hate on a single person it can have serious consequences the same thing happened to van gogh no imams in the netherlands said he should be killed but the organized hatred was so massive that he was made an outlaw and in the end someone killed him independently
5382763 yes if you take a look at some of the people in the entourage of some of the imams theyre short cropped psychopaths they remind me of nazis
5382764 my niece went to an arab wedding where several people walked out because she was related to the traitor my nephew was apprenticed to a pakistani mechanic when he found out i was his uncle he was fired my mother receives calls from the middle east where she is told what will be done to me and the family
5382765 all kinds of things i wont go into details but im not the only target my extended family is also a target
5382766 i have asked myself many times what is my crime what did i do my crime is to say that i want to combine islam and democracy that is what some see as a crime now the imams are saying that with the muhammed affair they have put limits on how much islam and moslems can be offended they think the danes have been taught a lesson i say that founding democratic moslems has acted as a lightning rod which has helped hinder a smear campaign and lynch justice against moslems in denmark that is also the impression i get from my emails that now it is clear that moslems are different
5382767 the ones who arranged the conference in bahrain that is amongst others al qardawi him thats him
5382768 its him who talked about the friday of wrath its him who said the moslem wrath must strike denmark al qardawi was among the first to issue a fatwa justifying the killing of innocents for purposes of jihad were seeing the consequences of that in iraq where innocent civilians are slaughtered al qardawi helps decide how to be a moslem in the west with the others he issues fatwas about how women should work fatwas against fraternisation between the sexes fatwas against moslems working in banks because they collect interest and al qardawi also organises a conference which the danish imams were delegates to i have realised that they have a very strong international network
5382769 there are two kinds of salafists one is the wahabi salafists which includes people like osama bin laden and the al qaeda network and then there are the salafists of the moslem brotherhood salafism means to go back and live life like it was lived at the time of the prophet the bin laden salafists are for global jihad using terror as the means the brotherhood salafists acknowledge the weak position of moslems at the moment and therefore discourage violence their means are to educate spread the faith and gain control of moslem societies they think sharia should be the law where moslems live that means that that youth thing is actually the consequence of that education where they refer to quotes from the koran and are in the process of being brainwashed
5382770 what is significant about both kinds of salafists is that they have embraced the concept that as long as youre weak it is acceptable to be double dealing that was what shocked me most that some danish imams are salafists salafists hate everybody whos not like them they are also against other moslems and especially secular moslems and moslems who want to combine islam and democracy
5382771 maybe we should investigate who should have met who and so on that may be but i think that we should be careful that it doesnt distract us from what is the real issue the real issue is to strengthen the integration and its about the fact that we have some trojan horses among us the salafists and they worry me sick
5382772 i dont want to talk about that investigation because it distracts from what its really about were facing an incognizable enemy from within thats why we need to be united in the fight against this enemy but i would like to make it clear that i am a fanatical democrat i dont want ministers to abuse their power and not inform the parliament all that needs to be in order that said theres something more important than that we need to wake up we are dealing with an enemy within who is more dangerous than you can imagine i recently realised that
5382773 salafism has nothing to do with the governments immigration policies salfists are present in the netherlands and spain too the ones who blew up themselves in madrid were salafists too the salafists try to maintain pressure and in my opinion they are the ones who are responsible for the muhammed conflict it might be true that the way our allies act the lack of support from the other eu countries and the us it might have something to do with our immigration policies i wont reject that notion out of hand but this is about something much bigger than that consider the egyptian ambassador to denmark whos a christian by the way she said that the main culprit is naser khader because when he said that he disagreed with the islamic faith community an apology had almost been imposed on the danish government he split the moslems so a hidden agenda was most certainly present there was a fight about who would command the moslems in denmark and the west they used the cartoons as an excuse in that fight
5382774 i am worried about the general lack of knowledge of what we are dealign with and that is true for the political system in general ask people in christiansborg if they know the salafists in all parties not just my own there is a desperate naivity and lack of knowledge in regard to the salafists and the threat we are facing this disturbs me
5382775 no theyre not that is what we need to remember always and that is why we need to stop talking about the moslems the salafists hate the majority of moslems who arent like them the problem is that they wield a lot of power there are 100 imams in denmark but only five or six are prominent
5382776 its been revealed that they are salafists thay have hidden agendas them going to a conference arranged by a man like that really who bankrolls them by the way you cant go to a conference like that in bahrain for less than 30 000 dkk where does that money come from
5382777 yes they receive a lot of support theyre also backed by totalitarian regimes with their own agenda thats also why they fear me becoming minister for integration
5382778 yes thats why akkari talks about someone blowing me up if id been asked six months ago i would have said no i dont have the energy now i only have one goal and thats to become minister for integration
5382779 because i am their worst nightmare because i understand them because i know their ideology and their agendas i know how to resist them and i understand the various connections thats the first the second is that concrete initiatives are needed to really turn on the switch for the majority of moslems who are marginalised unemployed and unintegrated one of the most important things is to unite them and all other danes under the flag of some common values i think thats more important than standing around throwing rocks at each other calling each other sheeps goats and dangerous
5382780 i can tell from the polls that there is a possibility for a majority consisting of the liberals the conservatives and the social liberals
5382781 hi naser khader when i vote i usually vote for the danish peoples party but if i promise to vote for you will you promise me to stay on in danish politics
5382782 once i was very racist and voted for jonni hansen note nazi for local elections because of people such as abu laban and ahmed akkari
5382783 its nice to know that democratic moslems exist and i will join the support organisation immediately its way cool that youve tatooed democracy in arabic in case you should run into one of the imams
5382784 i see myself as a classic social liberal and i very much feel a connection with the original spirit of the party and thats why i think that what i represent is pure radicalism note see note at top that is what the social liberals have been known for and they have been frontline soldiers in the fight against blind religiousity and against intolerance theyve been frontline soldier for democracy and the rule of law as s ren bald says take a look a this
5382785 dear cousin its an extraordinary pleasure to see that the strongest and the best values of the social liberals centered about freedom of speech democracy and secularism are represented by one man who has come to both denmark and the social liberals from without but who in such an elegant way has understood what democracy is about a man who doesnt want to implicate all kinds of pseudo considerations into the substance of free formation of opinions and real freedom of speech its an honor for the social liberals that this man has come to us as his party of choice
5382786 why should i change my party i am a social liberal and i think that what i do is in keeping with the radical spirit of the social liberals
5382787 it cant be done something like that would be possible in the us for the republican president to appoint a democrat to be a minister but it cant be done in denmark
5382788 to be honest the matter of integration is in need of us going beyond calling each other sheeps goats and dangerous its simply that which i feel people need unity cooperation and in the end some form of national bi partisan agreement its more important than party politics
5382789 yes they need to get the thing they fear they are the greatest enemy of integration they are greater enemies of integration than the danish peoples party the danish peoples party are nothing compared to them but its not enough to resist them its also important to do something real for the integration look at the cooperation the democratic moslems have with employers it shows that it can be done
5382790 yes to take an example theres a bank that has contacted us and said that they would like 50 100 new apprentices from the immigrants millieu and we help them get them as the leader of the democratic moslems i have had meetings with some of the biggest danish companies who want to contribute the fact that we have shown ourselves to be democrats means that we meet greater understanding were also planning to do job sites on our website before the muhammed conflict employers were worried that employing moslems would be problematic but now we can tell the sheep from the goats among the moslems
5382791 yes i want to clean the place up because thats what they fear the most because so much swindling cheating and humbug is going on
5382792 the many thousands of letters from citizens have touched me deeply and i have also received a lot of support from fellow politicians marianne jelved note leader of the social liberals has called she was very worried and it also impressed me that fogh in the middle of last weeks eu summit called me and spent half an hour supporting me he caught me on my cell phone all i said was that i needed some breathing space to reconsider my priorities i didnt say that i wanted to leave politics
5382793 yes and i mean it that is my goal it may be that some wont like it but i am my own best advisor because i have a project for life now and that is to fight those intolerant islamists i am so tired of them they and their big beards make me want to vomit and then they issue a fatwa that you cant shave many of the refugees from iran fled those things and then we have to face it here again their goal is to impose sharia on moslems in the west and the motto of the salafists is and in arabic it sounds almost poetic allah is our goal the koran is our law jihad is our way and death as a martyr our highest aspiration thats the motto and thats why they need to be fought to last fucking democrat
5382794 the political is not the primary thing in the democratic moslems on the board are people from several different parties the primary goal is to spread democracy among moslems and to do everything to draw away the marginalised moslems from the islamists and to include them in danish society thats also why i dont like defining myself by my religion i agree with fogh that religion has too big a place in the public space and i disagree totally with haarders wish for more religion so no democratic moslems will not become a political party even though i am sometimes frustrated i feel more at home with the social liberals i have been a member for 22 years and i feel that my actions are in keeping with spirit of the brothers brandes and h rup
5382795 i didnt in my wildest dreams think it would fill up so fast

5382798 not only are consumers interested in green products and companies our survey shows that nearly half of them will pay at least five percent more for them
5382799 with so many consumers online researching and purchasing products retailers should include relevant environmentally conscious information throughout their paid and natural search campaigns affiliate promotions display ads and e mail

5382813 cll and fl collectively represent approximately 30 percent of the more than 73 000 non hodgkin lymphoma cases diagnosed annually in the united states and canada
5382814 current conventional therapy is non curative in these patient populations our goal is to bring new therapies to patients the partnership with aegera accelerates the clinical testing of a novel blood cancer therapy and brings us closer to that goal

5382818 the first time i heard him talk to a black church he was very professorial more so even than he was in the white community there was no joking no self deprecation no style it didnt go over well at all
5382819 he learned that for barack obama it was not the type of district unlike obamas state senate district where the university of chicago and the multicultural hyde park produced most of the votes rushs congressional district extended deep into black neighborhoods where obama was unknown that he was well suited for
5382820 the type of campaign that he had to run to win that district is not barack obama it was a predominantly african american district it was a district where you had to campaign solely on those issues and barack did not campaign that way and so as a result he lost which was good
5382821 considering the white supremacist interests have made his road far steeper than any white or clinton candidate
5382822 the young men need to remember that obama is not running for president of the blacks he is running for president of the u s
5382823 what about israel obama would anyone have an issue of course not but oops barack obama has already answered that question hasnt he
5382824 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same u s government that you aspire to lead and we are talking about attacks like the subprime mortgage that you spoke of that wasnt just a general ambiguous kind of phenomena but a phenomena that targeted the african community and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell by the new york police department and javon dawson right here in st petersburg by the st petersburg police and jena 6 and hurricane katrina and the list goes on in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on the behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country

5382840 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is no effort without error or shortcoming but who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself for a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat

5382869 they recently hired an adhd expert who noted in the minds newsletter i got yesterday how hideous autism was because she read how parents loved their autistic child but got no love back from the child
5382870 the biomedical treatments that some feel have been shown to lead to recoveries are complex comprised of several inter dependent parameters and carried out over a long period of time usually for a minimum of two years
5382871 so studies on mice monkeys and in vitro are good enough to suggest treatments but those treatments cannot be subject to clinical trials this is quackery pure and simple

5382873 ms mccarthy also contends that mercury in vaccines caused damage to her sons gut and immune system leading to autism yet the mercury preservative ms mccarthy assails was removed from the childhood vaccination series in 2001 her son evan was born in 2002

5382901 the club has massive commercial developments and in fact they now define the nature of their business as being football and property
5382902 the only danger is they might have predicated a few decisions on the premise that highbury square was going to bring in more revenue than it might realise
5382903 however i would say arsenals finances are very good not withstanding the fact they have got a huge debt which is manageable as long as they fulfil three criteria
5382904 these are that they play to sell out grounds in the english premier league that they enjoy a successful run in the champions league and that they keep their wage to turnover ration at a healthy level under 60
5382905 if they continue to do that there is a very great difference in going in to debt and trying to buy success through the purchase of players and going into debt to build a new stadium as arsenal has done which triples your matchday income at one fell swoop
5382906 it worked well with denilson and fabregas that night of course you cannot say after just one match you need a run of games to see if a partnership will work but i am confident it will

5382915 people with depression and those taking antidepressants especially ssris are 50 more likely to fall than other older people
5382916 very common and risk factors for falls are easy to identify
5382917 this risk associated with ssris has been reported before but not in such a large group of older people living in the community
5382918 but in people with depression falls add to the consequences of depression there is an opportunity to offer fall prevention strategies as part of the initial treatment for depression in patients and as part of ongoing treatment
5382919 we need to increase the awareness among family members on fall prevention
5382920 more than one third of patients with depression will fall and the consequences can be disastrous our findings emphasize the need to incorporate fall prevention strategies in stroke services
5382921 we need to emphasise fall prevention during treatment of depression in older people

5382928 on another thread democrats admission of lack of mental health is noted in a gallup poll perhaps the reason for a lot of self revulsion on the left could derive from infatuation with a revolt from authority and setting oneself up in a narcissistic personality cult as did the dictators above could it be inquiring minds want to know
5382929 is a perfect example of an unhappy leftist projecting his own status onto milton friedman even lenin would not have called mf that but of course the left is now in a downward spiral except in venezuela
5382930 better yet even if theres no one available for advise other than the socialist and anti globalist then ask no one
5382931 the term is used as a well meaning man of the left who serves as a dupe for guys like lenin who were criminals terrorists that sought
5382932 friedman was widely admired by a lot of good latin american presidents and ministers of economy or finance
5382933 among them were his patents of nobility which were always top secret among even the top communists back in his comintern days he was a hereditary noble just like prince kropotkin only prince k had class and didnt institute the gulag program which anne applebaum demonstrates was started by lenin in the early 20s

5382940 christina aguilera back to basics tour live and down under
5382941 have been in the process of reviewing our policies regarding the police presence in the residence halls and will continue to do so in the light of this ruling
5382942 the police were not lawfully present in the student residents sixth floor living area because the police had no greater right absent a warrant or consent than a private citizen to act in the manner that they did
5382943 we decline to comment on the effect if any these new regulations would have on our decision
5382944 i do not agree with jacob houvener that officer matt kuhrt lacked legal authority to enter his dormitory hallway clothed with this authority police have routinely been present in dormitory hallways thus student residents lack the requisite expectation of privacy to exclude police and safety personnel
5382945 our policy already reflects pretty much what the latest finding gives to us so we arent going to deviate from that
5382946 our policy to begin with was that we dont do routine patrols
5382947 we dont have the sort of staff to do routine patrols every once in a while someone might find themselves in the residence halls and they might wander around a bit but we dont do that anymore
5382948 i know the division is going to make sure our staff particularly those that work in the residence halls are trained on making sure they understand what the recent ruling means
5382949 student safety is always a paramount issue and we want to make sure we do everything we can to make students feel safe in residence halls but at the same time we dont want to overstep our bounds
5382950 i dont think anybodys really excited about the idea of police patrolling the halls of residence halls

5382953 twisted pair copper interconnect is critical for volume deployment of 10 gigabit ethernet and end customers are demanding nics which support dual ports
5382954 we are proud to demonstrate the first viable 10gbase t dual port nic and look forward to supporting the development of nics for the upcoming generation of pcie gen2 servers which fully exploit the available bandwidth
5382955 currently available 10gbase t phy multi chip silicon from our competition does not permit deployment of dual port nics due to their high power in excess of 10w port
5382956 aquantias low power aq1001 enables dual port nics with a proven 90nm design

5382958 liberals recreated the american soul first in the media and then in the teachings and textbooks of americas schools by the time the viet nam war was underway the real battle was already over
5382959 of their national character their cohesion and vision in place of these stood attributes of ethnic pluralism leftist self hate and alienation
5382960 liberals are not concerned with outcomes or even with how policies work they are only concerned with how policies feel
5382961 thus they often embrace false and unworkable principles like equality simply because they are emotionally irresistible
5382962 the known propensity of a democracy is to licentiousness which the ambitious call and ignorant believe to be liberty
5382963 democracy is the pathetic belief in the collective wisdom of individual ignorance
5382964 human beings need a system where rights are earned and balanced by responsibility a free and undisciplining political system like liberal democracy allows and encourages misbehavior people then misbehave by the very freedom which it affords liberal democracy accommodates peoples corruption and then abandons them to it rather than encouraging them to improve
5382965 a whole political philosophy libertarianism has developed around the concept of maximum individual freedom of action without any thought as to why we face more and more restrictions
5382966 the problem is not how to induce men to live cooperatively without imposing on their individual rights
5382967 devise sensible necessary and limited restraints to induce good behavior with as little trauma as possible
5382968 it is judicious coercion openly arrived at and fairly administered which will achieve this end
5382969 must be psychologically reenthused and reimbued with the concept of community
5382970 a politicians thinks about the next election a statesman thinks about the next generation
5382971 it remains for conservatives to acknowledge that democracy is self terminating and to develop an alternative which balances rights with responsibilities
5382972 t o live within a just order is to live within a pattern that has beauty the individual finds purpose within an order and security whether it is the order of the soul or the order of the community without order indeed the life of man is poor nasty brutish and short
5382973 most of the advertising is aimed at the guys and they need to clean up their act
5382974 it is not that the region does not have health professionals it does but the trouble is that they tend to be clustered in state capitals and other major towns
5382975 a woman should not start having children too early in life because if a womans body is not ready to receive pregnancy the likelihood that they should start having children at about the age of 18 or older also many women in the north will not allow a male doctor to attend to them during delivery
5382976 post partum is the most dangerous period the treatment should be taken immediately when the bleeding starts even small cottage hospitals i believe have such medication available drugs intravenous estrogen and intravenous fluid curettage and other tools but the treatment must begin within two hours to be effective
5382977 she will be rushed to the hospital at the last minute and by that time it is too late to save her
5382978 estimates of maternal deaths are under reported by as much as 50 percent because maternal deaths are more often than not counted at all
5382979 what we need most is to raise awareness in the rural areas to practice safe motherhood this is possible even in a dicey situation like ours
5382980 as for the issue of religion what we have started doing is to work with other faith based organizations to help us in propagating this information we are also working very closely with some traditional organizations and community based agencies which are also helping us to make information widely available to different groups of people
5382981 the total federation account allocated to the 19 northern states from 1999 to 2007 is 2 4 trillion naira 100 million dollars what is lacking is the political will and public commitment if the governors muster the political will there is hope that the world will witness appreciable progress on the attainment of the mdgs
5382982 reporting services 2008 was able to respond to 3 4 times the total number of users and their requests on the same hardware without http 503 service is unavailable errors compared with reporting services 2005 regardless of the type of renderer
5382983 based on our tests we believe that every reporting services 2008 installation or upgrade should pay close attention to the disk configuration of the report server databases
5382984 i wonder why all of those people who arent coughing want cough syrup
5382985 industry best practice demands standards based web development but theres very little foundation level information available for students
5382986 the average beginner tutorial is out of date and most standards based articles are beyond beginner level operas new curriculum aims to fill that gap with a set of articles showing how to build standards compliant web sites from the ground up
5382987 as one of the worlds premier web technology companies yahoo prides itself on following best practices and building the web the right way to enable us to become the starting point on the internet for our consumers
5382988 therefore yahoo insists its employees be competent in their knowledge of web standards the opera web standards curriculum delivers exactly the spread of knowledge yahoo would expect a front end developer to know
5382989 the opera web standards curriculum developed by top industry professionals is an excellent rubric for educators to review affirm and enhance their current instruction
5382990 the school of computing university of dundee gives its full support to the web standards curriculum from opera this will be an invaluable resource for the teaching of web standards at all levels and will fill an important gap in the available resources about this important subject
5382991 operas choice of industry leaders for preparing course material emphasizes the importance of the material this course will help students to learn the right way to implement web design and will increase their understanding of the importance of web standards for creating valid web resources university level students will find the wealth of material in the course allows them to brush up on current knowledge find new ways of doing old tasks and discover new technologies for implementing web design dundee university intends to use material from the course in our undergraduate teaching to emphasize the right modern way of doing web design
5382992 opera has always fought to bring web standards to a global audience
5382993 the new web standards curriculum will reach many web developers who are new to web standards arming them with the tools and information they need to deploy web standards easily and efficiently im proud that opera can play an even greater role in spreading web standards to developers all over the globe
5382994 the science provided by the blue crab advisory report is critical as state resource managers make decisions regarding the blue crab fishery

5382996 front seat cushions are under a lot of pressure these days
5382997 takes several minutes to prepare which keeps a person busy
5382998 before i bought i researched through the internet and talked with several
5382999 i get a lot of orders from the u s military probably because they are discovering turkish coffee in the gulf and iraq
5383000 many people think that the turkish coffee is a special blend that is only grown in turkey so it has to be exported and bought separately
5383001 you can make turkish coffee from any type of coffee you buy as long as it has been ground to a fine powder
5383002 and every major grocery store in the u s has a grinder with a turkish coffee setting
5383003 recent studies done on cafestol a molecule with anti carcinogenic properties showed that it is present in the highest quantity in unfiltered coffee drinks such as french press coffee or turkish coffee
5383004 you have to sit down first before you even take a sip
5383005 otherwise due to the small cups its served in it will spill on you this is probably another reason why it is traditionally shared with others
5383006 the memory of sharing even a single cup of coffee will last for 40 years
5383007 it is fun to prepare it and serve it in little cups and the taste is great
5383008 turkish coffee is sort of catching on in central alabama
5383009 people are tired of the espresso and the milkshake like coffee drinks they are not unique anymore
5383010 its not surprising then that they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
5383011 religious suffering is at the same time an expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature the sentiment of a heartless world and the soul of a soulless condition it is the opium of the people
5383012 no we are not a separate party like our friends and allies in the feminist labor civil rights religious and community organizing movements many of us have been active in the democratic party we work with those movements to strengthen the partys left wing represented by the congressional progressive caucus
5383013 there is a trend in modern politics that we refer to on the left as neo conservatism this from my view could be defined as a post modern dialectical methodology of nihilism what i mean to say is as follows nihilism suggests that survival is attributed to the will to power the weak are destroyed by the strong and so to maintain survival one must destroy the weak or in turn be destroyed this is why neo conservatism tells us that we must take an offensive stance against terrorism if we do not destroy our foe they will destroy us
5383014 political power grows out of the barrel of a gun
5383015 it is not the consciousness of men that determines their being but on the contrary their social being that determines their consciousness
5383016 no era justo que nosotros pag semos lo mismo que los peludos ya que ellos dan m s trabajo
5383017 se ha hecho justicia hoy es un gran d a para los calvos del mundo

5383023 when we looked realistically at how much time ronny turiaf will play for us
5383024 its probably not a number that justifies that kind of financial commitment
5383025 the last thing a 25 year old like ronny wants to do is sit on the bench
5383026 ronny feels strongly that his future is not here in los angeles
5383027 he feels its time to move on and thats a hard thing for a kid like that to say
5383028 the emotion he brought whether he was playing or not

5383049 excuse me sir how do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time
5383050 several years ago i was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp when i rubbed it a genie appeared and offered me two wishes my first wish was that if i ever had to pay for anything i would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there
5383051 most people would wish for a million dollars or something but youll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live
5383052 thats right whether its a gallon of milk or a rolls royce the exact money is always there
5383053 my second wish was for a tall chick with a big ass and long legs who agrees with everything i say
5383054 demand ed that dean carlota not be allowed any extension of his term beyond his birthday
5383055 the agreement reached last november 2 allows dean carlota to join the search as a nominee seeking extension of his term provided he submit just like any other nominee to an open transparent and deliberative process
5383056 we are not requesting the board to reject outright dean carlotas request for extension we are simply appealing that the board respect the universitysanctioned agreed upon selection process and make its decision after deliberative mechanisms within the community directly affected be first implemented to ensure that the selection process is participatory and meaningful for the stakeholders
5383057 public office is not the private reserve of public officers
5383058 who practically begged for an extension so that he could hold on to his administrative post

5383062 i think it is good there are many diseases that can be created in todays world such as hiv through illegal sexual relations
5383063 when i first came to jail i cried so much blood was coming out of my mouth my husbands brother told me he would give my children back when i came out of jail but he has become a talib nobody comes to see us in jail there are a lot of diseases
5383064 the ones who killed my husband they have money and they threw me in jail i am 100 per cent innocent i have no one no brother to look after me
5383065 there is a dangerous tendency to accept in afghanistan practices which would not be countenanced elsewhere because of cultural differences and local traditions
5383066 they are very aware of the inequality in the system

5383076 well did isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites as it is written this people honors me with their lips but their heart is far from me
5383077 woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayers therefore you will receive greater condemnation
5383078 woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you travel land and sea to win one proselyte and when he is won you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves
5383079 this book can change people it can bring catholics and protestants together pope benedict xvi emphasized that the pauline year is an ecumenical event thats why he invited so many other faiths to his declaration of the year of st paul
5383080 because of the amazing grace that he received paul was able to spread the message of christ to many people
5383081 we cant have any evangelization when people do not think that they are sick with sin and need help this is why paul uses the bad news to show that all people are sinful and then the good news with the faithfulness of god and promise to all his people is fulfilled in jesus christ
5383082 benedict xvi said its not just a question of who was paul but who is paul and how he can speak to us today especially during this year
5383083 by studying pauls letters and the acts of the apostles where we learn about pauls life we can appreciate what paul says because he was writing under the inspiration of the holy spirit and he continues to talk to us today
5383084 catholics dont know gods words and how hes revealed himself in salvation history as well as not completely understanding the traditions of the catholic church as a result of not knowing gods word and the church they cant bridge the gap between faith and everyday life
5383085 but scripture is filled with hope and truth studying the bible is about regaining our story and realizing who we are
5383086 there is one thing we find in pauls writings and that is the knowledge of our god and father and of his son our lord jesus christ once again jesus in the holy eucharist is going to lead us back to the father to discover who god is and what that makes us sons and daughters of god
5383087 of all the neutrals switzerland has the greatest right distinction she has been a democratic state standing for freedom in self defense among her mountains and in thought in spite of race largely on our side

5383090 this is a rare opportunity for doctors nurses and others to interact with leading catholic theologians religious educators ethicists and philosophers

5383096 arsenal star says they have a chance but need to buy wisely
5383097 i belive in this pre teen website team they have potential and bringing in anyone else with experince will kill them
5383098 i saw arsenal they have a good team but have a small group of experienced players the second group is full of boys they have talent but maybe arsenal are without the depth needed to win the title
5383099 if arsene doesnt think we need anyone we dont need anyone
5383100 we have to make that decision but i believe he will play yes
5383101 he has worked very hard since he has come back
5383102 you cannot say he will be at his best but he will be fit enough because his reaction on saturday after the game did not seem too bad
5383103 at 21 he already has a lot of experience and he is an intelligent boy
5383104 but i would not like to put too much pressure on him
5383105 we know we have every single player in his area is very important and now he has maybe more experience than the others now
5383106 to win big trophies like euro 2008 makes you more confident and gives you something you can pass on to the team around you
5383107 it will still take some time before i start full training although the recovery process is going on fully and in the last week i was able to play with the ball after a long time
5383108 it has still been just light kicking as i cant kick properly i have to be patient and wait for the moment when i am absolutely fit not to rush anything
5383109 my target is always to spend the right money on the right player therefore the timing of your buy is also important as well
5383110 he has not called and if he does how much i would i begin with a two and this would be followed by a high figure
5383111 theyre a lot better than the big kid boots you had me in last year finally i move up the list enough to get a nice pair of hunting boots theyre comfortable my feet stayed dry and they fit right

5383117 there are things about elephants that seem so similar to us their family life their emotional life the fact that they grieve they stand out from other animals
5383118 i think the real shock right now in terms of the mirror self recognition tests and their intelligence and their emotions is theyre like us its not that theyre way up there its that theyre on level footing with us
5383119 humans are regarded as the enemy you must never ever be cruel to an elephant because they have an amazing memory they will remember that for life and they bear grudges

5383130 by muslim male extremists between the ages of 17 and 40
5383131 for the award winning act of stupidity now the people of america want to elect to the most powerful position on the face of the planet the presidency of the united states of america to a muslim male between the ages of 17 and 40 have the american people completely lost their minds or just their power of reason im sorry but i refuse to take a chance on the unknown candidate obama
5383132 which is why his confusion about barack obama continues to eat at him
5383133 does he trust a local newspaper article that details obamas christian faith or his friend leroy pollard a devoted family man so convinced obama is a radical muslim that he threatened to stop talking to his daughter when he heard she might vote for him

5383135 thomas jefferson was accused by the federalists of selling out to the french the anti federalists were just as convinced that john adams was in cahoots with the british and intent on restoring monarchal rule the use of patriotism as a political sword or a political shield is as old as the republic

5383138 for the young veterans i meet when i visit walter reed for those like john mccain who have endured physical torment in service to our country no further proof of such sacrifice is necessary and let me also add that no one should ever devalue that service especially for the sake of a political campaign and that goes for supporters on both sides
5383139 i believe those who attack americas flaws without acknowledging the singular greatness of our ideals and their proven capacity to inspire a better world do not truly understand america but when our laws our leaders or our government are out of alignment with our ideals then the dissent of ordinary americans may prove to be one of the truest expressions of patriotism
5383140 under the constitution all men are created equal and all are entitled to be treated with dignity
5383141 no one is undeserving of humane treatment it is an unmistakable lesson of history that when one group of people starts to see another group of people as other or as different as undeserving as inferior ill treatment inevitably follows
5383142 after six and a half years we now know the truth about the detainees at guantanamo some of them are terrorists some of them are foot soldiers and some of them were just innocent people caught in the wrong place at the wrong time but the detainees at guantanamo have one thing in common with each other and with us they are all human beings and they are all worthy of humane treatment
5383143 it is a testament to the continuing greatness of this nation that i a lowly air force reserve major can stand here before you today with the world watching without fear of retribution retaliation or reprisal and speak truth to power i can call a spade a spade and i can call torture torture

5383154 mr brown in his eulogising that nothing no prison cell no forced migration no violence no massacres could ever break the spirit of a people yearning to be free should understand that this equally applies to the palestinian people he conveniently forgot that his description of the suffering of the jewish people echoes the current oppression by israel of the palestinian people mr brown is out of step with the majority of the british people who while having a proud tradition of fighting anti semitism are no longer prepared to allow the israeli government to commit its acts of subjugation and oppression with impunity

5383159 i say art is music music is art they complement each other if an emotion makes me remember beautiful white sand and a blue horizon i want to do a painting but if i have my guitar and the same picture in my mind i compose a white sand piece of music its two forms of expression with brush with strings but the same emotion
5383160 the art school expected students not to know that much about the material i went there after five years of watching my father
5383161 i would ask him questions with the curiosity of a young child why do you use a palette that is glass instead of wood how do you clean the brush how do you approach the canvas when my father had a show he always brought me with him i met many of his colleagues it was fascinating to see different styles
5383162 they knew i am the son of my father and they saw that i was a good painter
5383163 i respected him as an artist and educated man but while i was paying attention i was trying to do my own thing
5383164 my father was not at the same level as a violin player that he was as a painter
5383165 my father was driving me all the time to gigs in his aquamarine alfa romeo then sneaking in see me i was so embarrassed well i was fourteen
5383166 he decided to buy a night club with the father of another member of my band why are we driving these guys to play everywhere he said lets buy our own place we played there every saturday and sunday during the week i was doing my art
5383167 i stopped playing with the band after my father died
5383168 we lost the poetic way to approach the music jimi hendrix died
5383169 the first years i worked mostly en plein air to study the light and shadow at different times of the day with different weather rain snow sun
5383170 after ten years of painting that way every day month after month i could do it in my memory i understood that it doesnt matter where you are you can paint anything so i decide to close myself in the studio to focus on developing the painting in my brain and then putting it on canvas i became a little more of a surrealist my style is not abstract even though its my interpretation i never use a photograph its the memory of a scene an emotion filtered through memory the memory is not completely realistic it is blended with your soul
5383171 you will have the vision and the sound the piece on canvas and the music complement each other

5383201 it works great because the perceived value of the free version is off the charts because everyone knows they are getting a subset of a product that is worth thousands of dollars to corporations its a bargain to them when they can start with the free version see if it meets their needs and then choose the higher end offerings if they need or want them
5383202 whenever you have people willing to pay for a version of your product take their money and return them a great product and value not only will that revenue act as a cash source foundation for your company but it will define the value of your product to those who only want a free version that in turn will create even more demand for both and leave you with happier customers

5383257 theres no doubt that when it comes to our treatment of native americans as well as other persons of color in this country weve got some very sad and difficult things to account for i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds

5383309 there were probably viable spores on spacecraft that were launched over the past few decades however we are quite careful to monitor the trajectories and subsequent disposition of the spacecraft so that we know what has happened to them

5383350 my daughter isabel sends me 750 000 pesos 440 dollars a month which is enough to cover my medical insurance taxes and minimum living costs
5383351 isabel left nine years ago because after making a huge effort to study agronomy she looked everywhere for work for six months even in other departments but she couldnt find anything a year and a half after she left they called her from the national coffee growers federation for a job interview but what good was it then
5383352 emigrating is not easy and luckily people are starting to recognise that
5383353 today it is accepted that it is difficult although it is true that there are also many positive factors involved
5383354 they want to pay it off quickly so that they have a foundation that will let them come back in five years with a solid base of capital they dont want to end up like some of her girlfriends who left saved a bit of money came back and then ran out and had to go back again just recently
5383355 there are a lot of people who go there to work to send back remittances and money to support their families in my case for example i was able to study nursing which i could never have done here and even though i like to come to visit i dont feel safe here anymore in my own city

5383363 we are horrified at the new federal policy it will cause havoc with our program and could jeopardize coverage for thousands of children
5383364 highly restrictive much more restrictive than what we want to do
5383365 enrolled at least 95 percent of children in the state below 200 percent of the federal poverty level
5383366 no state in the nation has a participation rate of 95 percent
5383367 no state would ever achieve that level of participation under the presidents budget proposals
5383368 the program was always meant for children in lower income families as states move higher up the income scale its more likely to substitute for private coverage
5383369 the state must establish a minimum of a one year period of uninsurance for individuals
5383370 the number of children in the target population insured through private employers has not decreased by more than two percentage points over the prior five year period
5383371 we have no evidence of a decline in employer sponsored coverage resulting from the childrens health insurance program
5383372 no state can meet 95 percent no state currently meets 95 percent
5383373 granting this expansion is essential to the health and well being of new yorks children

5383390 it is abject hypocrisy for brown to praise israeli achievements in the face of war terror violence threats intimidation and insecurity
5383391 why did he have nothing to say about palestinian achievements in the face of decades of ethnic cleansing illegal occupation political detentions and assassinations of civilians an illegal apartheid wall through the west bank and the siege of gaza he has completely swallowed the zionist narrative in his grovelings to olmert a case of one failing prime minister trying to prop up another
5383392 the university and college union has not even voted for a boycott
5383393 we have merely suggested that members reflect on their moral consciences and ask themselves whether they can with equanimity continue links with israeli institutions that are complicit in the attempted extirpation of the palestinian people and the colonisation of the west bank but clearly we have hit a raw nerve to judge from the hysteria in both governments bricup sees this as a mark of its achievement we have drawn national and international attention to this barbarism and we are receiving an increasingly sympathetic response from our israeli colleagues
5383394 he had the chutzpah to quote the prophet amos who never failed to speak truth to power about social injustice
5383395 brown has never managed to speak truth to power about anything unlike archbishop desmond tutu who has called israels siege of gaza an abomination
5383396 much of the finance for these partnerships is clearly coming from parts of the private and voluntary sectors that are allied to israel irrespective of its actions or policies as a state
5383397 but whatever the source we are urging our colleagues not to touch any of this funding with a bargepole it is blood money and they should recognise it as such

5383403 master dooku it is a very great honor that you would agree to spend this evening with me thank you
5383404 i too am very pleased to have finally met you madame ovorp i have heard a great deal about you
5383405 i have been impressed at how well you have raised your apprentice he has been the perfect gentleman and friend for my granddaughter i thank you parenting is hard enough but when the child is in your care for training your success is all the more meaningful
5383406 i expected you to make a play to put your granddaughter and my padawan together against the judgment of the council and my own
5383407 we respect them master dooku so we will comply fully with the demand that they not see each other face to face
5383408 however in the spirit of the law that you are wishing to impose i will tell you that while we respect i do not agree keeping them apart will only lead to the result you wish to avoid therefore i will either arrange or be the go between for their data messages they in turn have agreed not to go behind the jedis collective backs this is not negotiable i have already sent a communiqu to master yoda on this decision
5383409 i respect the jedi order master dooku they have been the movement behind much good i have taught my offspring to respect religions such as yours even if we do not agree with all the tenets would that my world had been the same
5383410 could you tell me lady just where that world is my information was not clear on your background
5383411 yes master jedi i knew you collected information on noela when it was done
5383412 it wasnt that your contacts were sloppy merely that they got much of their information from people that had already shown loyalty for my family how could i fault the caring of a hold parent for his own child
5383413 is it not i must misunderstand then even for a man with clear and concise motivations such as yours master dooku i think despite your need for power you do love the work of your own hands and young qui gon is certainly what he is due in part to you
5383414 i did not request this evening because i wanted to argue about the jedi decision i requested it because i wanted to meet the person most responsible for a dear friend of my granddaughter i thought him to be a man of culture and refinement that i could enjoy for an evening
5383415 i find to my pleasure that i was not mistaken

5383417 in agriculture we often look at how climate affects the food supply but not at how what we eat affects climate
5383418 the energy used in the food economy to provide the typical american diet and that used for personal transportation are roughly the same
5383419 far from trivial as nationally this difference amounts to over 6 of the total u s greenhouse gas emissions
5383420 challenging and essential for us today is building sustainable alternatives to our current food system in our own communities while these grassroots initiatives are often thriving all around us they seldom make the headlines we need to recognize and support them if we are to find that another world is possible in our lifetimes

5383423 in so many ways he was the opposite of most conservatives he rarely talked a good game but he always played one
5383424 francis was not a conventional movement conservative he was too smart too honest and as these essays indicate too ready to state social truths that the media had worked strenuously to conceal
5383425 what paleoconservatism tries to tell americans is that the dominant forces in their society are no longer committed to conserving the traditions institutions and values that created and formed it and therefore that those who are really conservative in any serious sense and wish to live under those traditions institutions and values need to oppose the dominant forces and form new ones
5383426 is the american conservative movement as totally bankrupt as it appears to be
5383427 it represents what the cultural elite thinks america and the world should and would be like if only the philistines would get out of the way and let the federation spend their money as the elite wants and the enduring popularity of the series suggests that no small number of viewers at least unconsciously share this vision or have absorbed its premises that of course is what comes of surrendering the production and even the meaning of popular culture to the elite
5383428 has specialized in surrendering and abandoning the premises of an authentic right and granted the granting the premises of the left

5383460 smoke in the atmosphere temporarily reduces the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface this transitory effect could partly offset some of the warming caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases and other pollutants
5383461 the heating of the smoke layer and cooling of the surface can lead to increased atmospheric stability which in turn may keep clouds from forming
5383462 we think that this influence of smoke aerosol on clouds further affects the balance of radiation reaching the surface in the arctic
5383463 whats the deal with all of these flavored waters i see at my neighborhood deli lately
5383464 heres the deal whats been missing from the entire kerry campaign is just how tough a motherfucker john kerry really actually is and its got jackshit to do with hunting geese and killing the vietcong kerry is a superhero the kind of valiant son of a bitch who doesnt give a rats ass about his own life in order to make the lives of others better

5383477 as the links i posted show there are people who either cannot distinguish between bushs
5383478 the current polling indicates a win for no by 8 to 15 points some in venezeula believe that chavez would respect a no win and carry on i am not so sanguine
5383479 why be concerned about deterring accusations of fraud if any such accusations could easily be shown to be baseless by transparent verifiable election procedures
5383480 dont criticize americas national and state governments or political parties ever
5383481 this has become a cottage industry staple for so many bloggers and crazed tv types like ko or even entire networks like msnbc which ko pollutes with his nightly diatribes
5383482 im reading some books about real dictators and the repression that they inflicted on populations and can only conclude that this generation has been sadly undereducated on real historical events
5383483 it confuses me cernig given the posts that appear so frequently from you and libby on your site arguing that the bush administration and the chavez regime are fundamentally the same
5383484 call me paranoid but i think bush is going to cancel the 2008 elections and rule as a dictator

5383490 i am pleased and honored to have been elected chair of the systems board of trustees for a second year and pledge to continue forging partnerships between the business community and our state colleges and universities
5383491 building a quality workforce is essential to a vibrant economy and our states colleges and universities play a vital role in that effort by delivering the best possible education while making effective use of sources
5383492 we must make sure that more students from groups traditionally underrepresented in higher education complete a post secondary program to ensure their own financial stability as well as contributing to the economic vitality of the state
5383493 these smart buoys are an example of noaas advancements in earth observing systems
5383494 noaa is working to improve our understanding of dynamic coastal areas like the chesapeake bay and how areas like the bay are affected by changes in the global ocean
5383495 placement of this noaa buoy is an important addition to the captain john smith chesapeake national historic trail and an important tool to gain additional scientific and ecological information about the chesapeake bay
5383496 this is the fourth buoy in the expanding chesapeake bay interpretive buoy system
5383497 placing this buoy off of stingray point will enhance our observations of the changing conditions of the chesapeake bay provide real time information for mariners and mark a significant spot in captain smiths remarkable exploration of the new world

5383503 deep lying assumptions about whether things or acts are good and to be sought after or bad and to be rejected
5383504 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the state
5383505 the father you spring from is the devil and willingly you carry out his wishes he brought death to man from the beginning and has never based himself on truth lying speech is his native tongue he is a liar and the father of lies

5383507 the rhetorical ethic plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the european utamaroho the energy source of a culture that which gives it its emotional tone and motivates the collective behavior of its members and the support of western european cultural imperialism it is the primary factor in a successful proselytization of the culture through the creation of a false image of the european and yet because of its subtly manipulative methodology and inherently deceptive technique it has for the most part gone undetected as an expression of european cultural nationalism
5383508 european culture is constructed in such a way that successful survival within it discourages honesty and directness and encourages dishonesty and deceit the ability to appear to be something other than what one is to hide ones

5383558 well there is good news and bad news the good news is that technically you are fine the bad news is that if you dont go to a medicenter or the jedi healers now your nose will never be the same again in my opinion you should also cancel any plans and have a quiet evening since i think you will need pain killers and soon

5383573 im finding that folks across the government are understanding more and more what collaboration means
5383574 we do have intelligence elements at work with most other parts of the federal government and they are understanding what collaboration is
5383575 all of those new kinds of concepts that are culturally altering are what the director of national intelligence brings to the intelligence community
5383576 working together we are collectively able to get better deals for the united states government
5383577 additionally it reduces overhead for both our organizations so that we dont have to duplicate contracting activities
5383578 our trading platform has quickly grown into one of the most visited sites in poland with operas popularity among polish users it was a natural step for us to cooperate and combine our services to meet the needs of the polish market
5383579 poland is a very important market to us and in order to stay relevant we are adding services such as allegro to our browser

5383581 openoffice org 1 1 5 for example launches about 40 faster than openoffice org 2 4
5383582 for cold start times version 2 4 is 38 slower than 1 1 5 over a span of 2 5 years
5383583 m office was faster but i never typed faster with it
5383584 in conclusion openoffice org is generally getting slower with each release however startup performance has made great improvements the performance losses are relatively small advances in new computer hardware are more than making up the loses and openoffice org continues to mature with new features openoffice org doesnt compel users to upgrade so you are welcome to continue using older versions

5383588 it looked and sounded presidential this was an instance of the white house experience of this campaign they knew how to handle this whats most important about it is that its not contrived its a real event and that distinguishes it from 99 percent of what happens in the campaign season
5383589 probably one of the worst instances of political opportunism in recent memory
5383590 the normally clear headed michael van der galien makes a very strange argument claiming an equivalency between rudys handling of 9 11 and hillarys handling of this incident i suppose that would make sense if rudy hadnt been mayor of new york city and if rudy had been hundreds of miles away and if rudy had merely pestered local authorities for updates instead of actually taking charge because he was in charge in short michael is very confused about the difference between a city wide catastrophe and a run of the mill hostage standoff and their implications
5383591 i dont see any reason to criticize her i think itd be hypocritical to do so sure shed milk it for all she could its politics and image is everything every other candidate would do it as well
5383592 perhaps well see republicans criticizing giuliani for his bragging about how he dealt with 9 11
5383593 along with taking charge while giving the professionals free rein
5383594 guiliani actually was mayor of n y and in charge of things most would agree he was a strong leader after 9 11 an unprecedented horrific attack on u s soil
5383595 i just can see her in the new york blast of 9 11 climbing a platform with the sleeves of her blouse up to her elbows embracing a firefighter around his shoulders with a bullhorn on her hands saying

5383602 bring a new person and an old friend who hasnt been out in a while
5383603 thats what i do best playing up tempo basketball with the clippers ive been in a post up game so im looking forward to playing here
5383604 im still stunned by what happened and that im in the bay area
5383605 im just trying to soak all this in its funny how this worked out
5383606 when youre the point guard you have to be the general on the floor
5383607 i was having phone conversations with baron and he was saying this is going to be great
5383608 lasted about 12 hours when we were all on the same page then in one phone call everything started going haywire
5383609 barons there im here and e b is in philly
5383610 so i got a pair of matt barnes old shoes and i ended up staying for two hours
5383611 all you good and well meaning people at politiken in the rest of denmark and europe you hurt your and moderate moslems cause when you let extremists call the tune
5383612 actually i was sort of seduced by abu laban the first day he seemed both friendly and tolerant but it was lucky that i stayed with them for some days because then all of the extremist ideology was revealed
5383613 i have never suggested that abu laban or ahmed akkari are terrorists themselves in the sense that theyre bombers theyre something much worse theyre the the ideologues which give the young mad man the necessary excuse the ideological grounds for carrying out an act of terror in denmark
5383614 i do know with who i am dealing i know the millieu and take my precautions
5383615 i have never wanted to condemn or hurt anyone and i have never attacked the koran or islam i am a practising moslem myself but i have a mission and it is journalistic to reveal the truth about extremists and terrorists
5383616 if i have to steal information i will i have no scruples about that with these people besides they knew very well that i was a journalist
5383617 a delegation of imams arrived from sweden and i think one of them recognised me then the threats came warning me to not show anything creative and thats the point how can those people say that they are democrats and moderates they threaten a journalist just because they find out that hes against terror and extremism
5383618 i have never thought he was talking about organising an attack himself and thats not the way my documentary portrays it he says i wonder if a couple of men oughnt to go see if one can blow him up i have no knowledge of a concrete plot but i know for sure that akkari and abu laban hate naser khader abysmally if someone were to kill him it wouldnt bother them the least
5383619 i brought 40 hours of tape to france and i couldnt use all of it i dont know who hes talking about either and i have no precise information that this person will do something concrete
5383620 no the two remarks are seperate the way i see it first abu laban speaks of amr moussa and then he changes the subject and speaks of the martyr operation
5383621 because it shows the same as the piece in the car with akkari that these people are extremists who have no problem talking abour martyr operations
5383622 of course he says that and ahmed akkari is suddenly a great comedian its very normal double dealing for the extremists that they hide behind explanations like that in the west but as an arab and a moslem i can assure you that no normal person in the moslem world sees the word martyr operation as a figure of speech
5383623 yes if they keep saying it was all a joke just a figure of speech and so on
5383624 for example i have a take from a sermon where abu laban tells of how to behave when burying our brothers who die a martyrs death in the fight against the zionist enemy will abu laban say that that too is a metaphor and do the danes really believe a man who supports suicide bombers in another country but maintains that he is against them in denmark
5383625 i have no precise knowledge of concrete plans if i had heard anything like that i would have gone directly to a police station if the danish police wish to talk to me if i can be of assistance i am always available i am a public person but i really hope that the danish intelligence service know significantly more about abu laban ahmed akkari and their friends than i do
5383626 that makes me smile in that case either the imams of denmark have succeded in hoodwinking the pis and that would make the pis would be very naive or else and i think thats the case the pis wants to pour oil on troubled waters though they know otherwise

5383689 they waited until it dried then chiseled what they could off
5383690 the rest they left on until i could wash it out with the most abrasive shampoo known to sentient beings
5383691 i didnt ask you on our twenty fourth date to discuss wedding plans

5383717 if you fell in love with him he must be the kind of man that the poets idolize

5383797 too often we think of the 20th century model of education separated from training and learning
5383798 i think that just as we mash up in our web space we can readily see mash ups that create new hybrid learning environments that involve both the historic institutions and other providers

5383877 reduction based control with application to three dimensional bipedal walking robots
5383878 our paper discusses a way of controlling robots to mimic human walking
5383879 bipedal form of motion is the most efficient walking form that we have that s why evolution has turned us in this direction we re trying to mimic that based on what we can do
5383880 when a walking robot is trying to move in three dimensions its hard to use simple methods
5383881 most of our motion is on a sagittal plane of motion an imaginary plane that travels from the top to the bottom of the body dividing it into left and right portions there are many well known methods for controlling sagittal plane robots we wanted to separate that control problem where it s very well understood then we can control the rest of the degrees of freedom separately

5384167 the strong link between nutrients and the dead zone indicates that excess nutrients from the mississippi river watershed during the spring are the primary human influenced factor behind the expansion of the dead zone
5384168 this analysis will greatly inform the development of federal state and local efforts to reduce the dead zones size

5384184 we are more focused on irresponsible behavior in the corporate sector i dont think illegitimacy comes anywhere close to the irresponsible behavior of people running the largest businesses in this country

5384200 my esteemed senate please understand i have nothing but the warmest regard and highest respect for the jedi order but i believe it was detrimental both to the jedi and to our republic i agree with the need for security and protection i would agree that as citizens of our great republic they certainly have a place and their voice should be heard and influence felt what i question is why one group of people is to take on our responsibility to keep us safe to mediate between worlds and make decisions based on their faith my gratitude is with the fact that for the bulk of that time they have kept that faith admirably but is it not time for us to grow up and embrace true principles of freedom and democracy and stop funding a state religion
5384201 does my lady mean to keep our galaxy without its best its highest protection do you mean to keep us weakened because those that have sworn to serve their fellow beings with their sabers will no longer have visible means of support
5384202 my dear senator from naboo do you suggest that there would not be a way for us to go forward with our already trained military do you mean to suggest the jedi would be incapable of finding answers on how to keep their faith going without the government sponsoring them keeping them from living the full lives they should have been given millennia ago
5384203 i do not presume to know more than your research my dear senator but has any of this senate realized the full import of your words do they realize what you are truly suggesting has it occurred to them why the agreements with the jedi took place do your friends the jedi know that you are here fighting for their extinction
5384204 i do not fight for their extinction i fight for their freedom to be as us all
5384205 what does that mean senator let me tell them what this means so that all of us that do not share the unique jedi gifts understand where your idea might take us if the jedi are allowed to strengthen and grow have the chance to work out the genetics of force ability how long before they enslave the galaxy how long before those of us with no special abilities and protections from persons that can use their minds to move objects even to kill another man are at their will instead of them being at ours

5384232 it covers the surface of society with a network of small complicated rules minute and uniform through which the most original minds and the most energetic characters cannot penetrate to rise above the crowd the will of man is not shattered but softened bent and guided men are seldom forced by it to act but they are constantly restrained from acting such a power does not destroy but it prevents existence it does not tyrannize but it compresses enervates extinguishes and stupefies a people till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals of which the government is the shepherd

5384237 when youre in second life your memory your ability to remember conversations you had is very acute the reason for that is the virtual world can easily present us with an understandable physical environment the novelty of the physical environment is has a strong agency in helping us to remember you can probably all remember the book you were reading when last on vacation because of the novelty of the location you were in when you were reading that book
5384238 meeting in virtual environments is going to be extremely commonly used
5384239 its likely we will be highly reliant on global providers that will be bringing people into second life

5384243 hey programmer if you want variant behavior for this chunk pass me a strategy object that tells me how to deal with this weirdo chunk of data
5384244 but what about the 6 other places where you use that saver object dont you have to hunt all those down and add that same line of code and isnt that going to be a source of bugs
5384245 but we have to change the database from mssql to oracle and we launch in 3 days
5384246 hey axis use httpclient instead of your built in communications object
5384247 what here seems brittle what seems like theres a high likelihood that itll need to change for some reason or another do the requirements give me any whiffs of potential change down the road
5384248 does my experience lead me to believe that this kind of thing is likely to change even though everyone says its not going to
5384249 you have got to be shitting me i wrote this
5384250 yeah i think this needs to be an object but no i dont think that list of objects will ever need to have calculated properties or methods for getting associated objects so ill use a query to solve the underlying problem that object creation is a dog in cf
5384251 do you ever need to know the gallery details when looking at a photo

5384265 the perception of jobs that he designs products in the middle of the night and builds them during the day has served apple well
5384266 people look at steve jobs in a lot of different ways being a good ceo being a good innovator being the messiah most of those perceptions are hard to shake
5384267 this is about one person giving a focused message and he delivers it very well
5384268 there are very few people that can deliver a message like steve other ceos only wish they had a fraction of the charisma that steve has
5384269 apple gets appointed as some kind of a poster child for that
5384270 but its not that far off from the normal culture
5384271 its a cultural style issue thats been in apples dna almost from the companys beginning
5384272 in almost every case even with john sculley michael spindler gil amelio apple ceos emerge as the company face and the public image
5384273 apples an 18 billion company it didnt get there because of one man
5384274 whoever leads the company is going to have to be part of the apple culture you cant come in and learn it
5384275 to that degree steves doing a great job of building that cultural acclimation into his leadership staff if wall street truly understood that the company is driven by both vision and execution any impact from a future jobs departure will be minimized

5384316 i think the scotland team did their country proud on saturday they put on a pretty good performance beating wales 21 9 ive been a rugby fan for years and ive played it since i was five so i was really excited about the match we had a try disallowed and then we got seven penalties in seven attempts which was great in my opinion the player of the match was sean lamont because he hung around a lot of the rucks so he could take the ball out and run very fast with it i also think euan murray played really well because he was strong and got through wales defence hes also my brothers favourite player i guessed scotland would win because we often beat wales i think we have a good chance of beating italy ireland and france in the rest of the competition we might even win the tournament
5384317 i was quite excited at the beginning but got nervous when it was not going our way it was just scotland kicking penalties i felt let down and disappointed dwayne peel was passing well and creating play but the best player of the match was chris czekary as he tried his best and created play wales could have played a bit better and given a bit more

5384322 under the new arrangement ibrahim said the nipp would contribute an estimated 1 140mw while independent power producers ipps were expected to contribute 1 300mw to bring generation to 6 040mw by 2009
5384323 she said since all the three tiers of government had agreed to use part of their share of the excess crude account to support the power sector both the federal and state governments would have to go to their various lawmakers to appropriate the said amount before it would be released for the projects the minister said while power generation by december 2008 is estimated at 4000mw 10 000mw would only be attained by 2011 not 2010

5384351 compressing bulky websites into mobile friendly sites will definitely boost sri lankas internet penetration we have already launched a series of campaigns on a national scale to promote internet not only to the busy urban society but also to rural population for the development of our country i have strong faith that opera mini will shoulder a tremendous responsibility in achieving this task
5384352 consumer demand for mobile web access in sri lanka has seen tremendous growth recently
5384353 there are several well known factors contributing to this growth as well as projections of future growth such as the low penetration of fixed telephone lines as well as pcs and internet access the availability of opera mini on mobitel further boosts mass market adoption of the mobile web while delivering an innovative browsing experience to users on any device anywhere

5384361 the ux meme of the consumer facing world leaking into the enterprise
5384362 the days of the battleship gray forms of data application as the king of the enterprise are numbered because of an imperative towards richer visualization of complex and interconnected data

5384366 there is no possible way to reverse the number into a fingerprint
5384367 there is no graphic representation in the system of the fingerprint
5384368 we were absolutely satisfied of their safety before we put any of this into place

5384374 the feeling in my district is that they are trying to get the homeless out of downtown away from the bok center and away from the proposed driller ball park
5384375 they want to move them away so that people going to see the eagles dont have to see the homeless
5384376 but what is wrong is when you do not tell the 18 000 or 20 000 people who live in the four square miles adjacent to admiral and yale whats going on with their families
5384377 youre helping 76 people at the expense of 20 000

5384385 i have even handled with grace your attempts to make any other man forget he actually knows me i was patient with the fact that michand thought i was some strange female stalker when i returned his personal items including his fathers shaving kit because he didnt remember our six month moving it to the next level relationship with that one little movement of your hand when you saw us at the governors reception
5384386 i am able to deal with the fact your little stunt put my newest aide in the mental trauma ward for post traumatic stress problems i am even able to manage the ever increasing consequences of you placing the ambassador from sanavi el in danger with a lower percentage of interest on loan monies and more outright grants for the damage and loss of life from electrical storms on their planet i am able to deal with all of the pets you feel free to bestow on me from time to time because the temple regularly threatens you with expulsion what i cant deal with is that 2 meter tall serpent that had the audacity to walk on its back legs and kept me from being able to leave my office for two days not even allowing me to use the refresher by myself because it decided i was a suitable prospect for a mate and no one besides you was capable to deal with the monster until the specialists from its home planet arrived as you were off world all of this could have been alleviated if you had thought to put a note on the case you sent it over in so that sharamea wouldnt have opened it out of curiosity it thought i was a mate what should i think about that

5384395 i dont think chuck schumer caused a run on the bank
5384396 i am concerned that indymacs financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers
5384397 the bank could face a failure if prescriptive measures are not taken quickly
5384398 come on chuck schumer wishes he was powerful enough as being able to cause a run on a bank
5384399 indymac had serious problems and a lot of investors had recognized that i dont like the finger pointing thats all im saying
5384400 the immediate cause of the closing was a deposit run that began and continued after the public release of a june 26 letter to the ots and the fdic from senator charles schumer of new york
5384401 the letter expressed concerns about indymacs viability in the following 11 business days depositors withdrew more than 1 3 billion from their accounts
5384402 96 percent of the banks that failed between 1990 and 2002 were first on the problem list according to an fdic study

5384413 were focused on intensity of flavors and providing coffee in the way it tastes best and its not in that size
5384414 we dont have any plans to phase out the venti
5384415 we know that people like to get all sorts of different beverages in that size and we are happy to provide them
5384416 is not a big gulp world people who are focused on the quality of the beverages and the gustatory pleasure of drinking coffee know you want to keep it hot and fresh and with 20 ounces it hard to keep it hot and fresh its like a glass of sauternes you want to enjoy highly concentrated flavors in small quantities
5384417 masking and adulterating the pure intense flavors we work hard to source roast and produce we dont want this to just be a caffeine delivery device
5384418 chicago is the only market in the country where the top selling size is 20 ounces
5384419 in all of the other markets the medium size is the biggest sellers so we are definitely keeping it
5384420 but i do think there is something to be said for a 20 ounce cup of drip i drink it most often because coffee changes its flavor and character at different temperatures

5384450 merci for the speed of a mad clown in summer
5384451 i have long campaigned for greater involvement in space science and industry so i am really pleased that this is on the senates agenda
5384452 the extent to which we are dependent on space technology is often taken for granted and australias involvement in this cutting edge field of innovation is just not up to par with other wealthy nations
5384453 a recurring theme during the inquiry was that space science is unmatched in its ability to inspire students to engage in science and engineering we are missing out on these benefits
5384454 if we want to be involved in this area it will require government support for a number of reasons few avenues of space activity are yet commercially viable in their own right
5384455 this does not need to cost billions of dollars we could pursue initiatives that would cost a lot less
5384456 i initiated this inquiry because i wanted the senate to evaluate the arguments for and against greater australian activity in space science and industry and for the government to consider this for the national innovation review
5384457 one of the trends were seeing is the increasing use of new media by non it literate departments of companies such as sales marketing pr etc or at least they seem to have more responsibility for new media projects that would previously have belonged to it the result is that we now target our marketing effort at a significantly different sector than before often there is no internal development resource so these people are outsourcing all the development and are trying to project manage it there seems to be a belief that the internet is easy now that its ubiquitous but the technical complexity and potential difficulties are the same as ever and will get even more complex as people expect to access web based applications via mobile devices
5384458 this is budget time when im looking at what we will be planning for next year within the company and reviewing the projects that are completing successfully this year without exception our business heads within the group are optimistic and single minded in building their businesses with greater awareness of offering services that are customised to the individuals needs which is impossible to do on scale without tightly focused it solutions servicing the it for a company as innovative and high growth as ours creates interesting dynamics as we ensure that the rock solid foundations that underpin the innovation remain solid as it scales the coming year sees us continuing to practice good corporate governance as we complete our comprehensive information security program based on best practice from the isf http www securityforum org and obtaining iso17799 we continue to innovate on the way we supply our it services and 2006 will see us continuing the success in using a blend of internal and external resources to give us the mix of stability expertise and flexibility which allow us to meet the needs of the business in an environment of faster change these are just some of the areas at the top of my mind at the moment and although not everything we are doing is on the glamorous side of it getting the basics right is fundamentally important for growth
5384459 i just like the direction of the team and the enthusiasm
5384460 i wanted to see more scoring than in our first scrimmage on tuesday
5384461 i wanted to see our special teams improve which they did and i wanted us to make some plays
5384462 that takes a lot out of you but i thought the defense held up pretty well
5384463 were getting a better look at everything opponents may run they push us hard and we push them hard
5384464 its a lot of fun only being here 10 days as a quarterback thats what you like to do is pass the ball
5384465 im just out there trying to learn the offense and work hard and get better
5384466 were pretty solid in all our positions theres always room for improvement but so far i think weve done pretty good
5384467 i think depth will be a major concern with us particularly on defense
5384468 some of our no 2s on defense really need to step it up
5384469 why do all of your sentences start in the middle of mine
5384470 we have respect for one another and we let each other finish our sentence if youre going to continue starting your sentences in the middle of mine im leaving and until you decide youre going to show me the respect you should be showing somebody of my status im not coming back
5384471 why do all of your sentences start in the middle of mine

5384475 in the late ninties their was a tv show on upn about a bunch of high school students who attended highschool on a cruise ship while traveling the world i thought kathrine hiegl and or ryan gosling possibly ben foster were on it but none of their imdb credits list it any clue what the show was called or who really was on it
5384476 well now lets see which ones of these i can sell
5384477 no no thats nothing thats none of those records i was talking about this is just something that has been lying around the house forever

5384480 hey i lost my virginity so im better than you
5384481 so i bet that comment of you losing your virginity to a girl is false
5384482 person whoa whoa as im listening to you speak i feel a growing uneasyness because i am wanting more mutuality and balance would you pause for a moment and let me tell you back what ive heard so far and see if im getting what you are telling me
5384483 you know what man i pride myself on just being where im supposed to be when im supposed to be there and that run after the catch
5384484 i watch t o a lot hes just a great athlete
5384485 but i dont think hes got anything on me as far as catching that ball and getting upfield
5384486 im always trying to learn i learn from eddie royal i learn from samie parker especially when owens gets here ill definitely keep an eye on him
5384487 my freshman year i was playing running back i was the new guy had just moved to a new city
5384488 they already had their roster set i told them i played running back
5384489 it was a jamboree game and they gave me a toss to the right i broke for about 30 yards shook about three people you know the usual they gave me the same play and i ended up fumbling the ball
5384490 little one you have been trained well to accept and make friends with all living beings just remember those rules of life i have taught you you will succeed beautifully and you might make a wonderful new friend concern yourself with only being the best friend to all living things and nothing will go wrong
5384491 yes please just call me noela lady ovorp is my mothers name
5384492 noela my name is qui gon jinn and i am to escort you two days from now do you have any idea what you would enjoy doing i had thought dinner at the very least but i had heard that you enjoy music the temple musicians are having a special concert that night and i could show you around the jedi temple if you have something you might like better however i am at your service
5384493 my quarters are not far from the embassy gardens we could meet there but then you dont know what i look like do you
5384494 honestly noela your white robe is perfect for you keep it simple and comfortable you always look y our best if you stay away from too much extra frou frou besides it is only a jedi and he is not eligible as a mate anyway
5384495 i swear noela you are clueless about so many things they are forbidden romantic attachments the rumor even has it that they brainwash them away from love although i know from a couple of girls at the university that they are not necessarily celibate not that any of this is going to affect what is essentially a diplomatic affair
5384496 no i expect not we will probably do this one event and i will bore him to tears and that will be the end of it
5384497 you go through door frames noela not into them it is a simple rule why have you never learned it
5384498 shall we go lady i have found a new little bistro the 23rd hour tucked quietly away near the temple i thought we could share an adventure to begin a friendship and try something no one knows anything about
5384499 i am all right i have just had a lifelong love affair with doorframes i havent met one yet i havent wanted to walk into as opposed to through
5384500 so you like doorframes what else should i know about you
5384501 i hiccup when i eat spicy food and while i have had musical training i hum off key when i am busy thinking of other things
5384502 i hope you are hungry i think it all looks like it might be wonderful doesnt it
5384503 it is nothing i just have a habit of falling apart after stressful events
5384504 oh you mean having to go out on this date even though you had never met me before i was very nervous too
5384505 qui gon are you sure you arent getting ill perhaps you should go to the healers or go get some rest
5384506 the healers would be grateful if i manage to not visit them today i keep them busy on a regular basis they would only laugh if they knew i was doing this and would insist i wear a ridiculous helmet i think you are the last person i want to see me wearing that contraption if you dont mind noela
5384507 may i call you sometimes noela i dont wish to bother you
5384508 bother me you could never be a bother please call me when you can and if you want
5384509 nu ska det v l ntligen bli fart p fildelningen
5384510 i guess you could say it was our aha moment
5384511 we had a lot of very sophisticated tools on the commercial side
5384512 we just thought it was a natural evolution to take them into the government space
5384513 growing at about 18 percent a year in the professional services world
5384514 we could have easily have spent 20 000 to hire a firm to validate the original design but we thought it would be nice to get some of our own engineering students involved in helping us solve a real problem at their alma mater
5384515 it was a great chance for undergraduates to work on such a national scale visible project
5384516 the cooling towers will save millions of dollars in operating costs in a relatively short time
5384517 emad jassims expertise and the results of the design project were used to push the design engineers to provide the best cooling tower system we can afford
5384518 everything we designed into the system is used in a refinery so what i learned will be very beneficial if i ever have to install a cooling tower or heat exchanger
5384519 the project showed us how important energy is because if you can save on power consumption you can spend the money on other things
5384520 it was very satisfying to know that our design could save the university so much money and that we had contributed to a petascale data center that will help scientists and engineers solve so many important problems
5384521 they not only optimized the design of the tower but they also optimized the components he said
5384522 next year mechse seniors will use their knowledge to reduce utility costs in the mechanical engineering laboratory on our campus
5384523 but you only want the ones that you cant get
5384524 a great deal has been achieved in the last three months but there is still so much more work to do it will take years for these families to rebuild their lives its vital that aid agencies like save the children have enough money to keep working
5384525 when the cyclone hit we ran off to an old barn i was very scared
5384526 and when the cyclone came we thought it was only going to last for a few hours but it lasted all night i was with my mother when it happened and we just ran
5384527 i like to read and to play with my friends i like studying mathematics and i want to be a doctor when i grow up
5384528 for children this age education is on of the most important things in the aftermath of a disaster education can create a safe and happy environment
5384529 these families lost everything and are dependent on the food they receive to survive
5384530 the cyclone flattened farm land destroyed farming and fishing equipment killed livestock and contaminated water farmers have said that they dont have enough seeds to plant this season and cannot afford to cover the costs of fertilisers or new equipment for the next seasons planting
5384531 the paddy field were flooded with seawater during the storm i am really worried that the baby rice plants will not grow well this year
5384532 before nargis the prices of vegetables were half toadys price
5384533 working for the olympics as an it contractor i recently moved to the media village where all of the reporters live and was surprised the there was no free internet bocog beijing organizing committee of the 2008 olympic games is charging a ridiculous amount of money for adsl service for 512 512 it costs 7712 5 rmb 1 131 20 usd 1m 512 it costs 9156 25 1 342 95 usd 2m 512 it costs a whopping 11 700 rmb 1 716 05 usd that is for only one month for extra features like a fixed ip that costs an additional 450 rmb 66 usd i just cant believe that not only do i have to deal with the great firewall of china but also pay through the nose to use it
5384534 ensure the smooth hosting of the olympics and safeguard the citys social stability during the olympic games
5384535 working for the olympics as an it contractor i recently moved to the media village where all of the reporters live
5384536 but it gave us kind of rubber legs you couldnt stand up it just kind of collapsed your legs
5384537 all of a sudden a wind picked up we were on the porch and we saw the boat starting to rock so we knew we had to come down and tie it down
5384538 we did not see any lightning or thunder or we wouldnt have run out there and it was literally the first bolt that came out of the sky happened to land right between us

5384580 there are virtual worlds for children such as penguinclub com and subeta org that charge kids or their parents for virtual doodads with which they can decorate their virtual pads
5384581 in other words theyre shelling out real cash for imaginary products
5384582 aside from the violence obscenity and negative themes the larger and greater problem lies in the fact that video games control many peoples hearts and minds creating a monotonous zoned out new reality
5384583 god family and friends do not exist in many games
5384584 activities like camping playing catch with dad swimming or just being a kid have vanished
5384585 while shopping for a new video game recently with my 13 year old grandson i previewed several of the latest releases
5384586 most were filled with intense violence involving killing and torture others involved witches and wizards
5384587 many parents do not have a clue what kind of gaming activity kids are participating in many dont preview the games their kids buy i encourage parents to know what kind of games their children are playing and restrict the amount of time they spend playing them
5384588 parents should place limits on childrens media use including when where and how much they can participate and we should be ready to address common myths that are often portrayed in the media such as the myths that to be worthwhile you have to be beautiful that money buys happiness that sex is merely recreation and has no consequences and that violence solves problems
5384589 todays 9 5 billion gaming industry is slick sophisticated and for some parents a little scary
5384590 on a spiritual level those of us in this industry are glad that gamers who play our games can get closer to god

5384598 we probably had the larger things covered but on a moments notice we were not as well put together as we could have been
5384599 it made us as a company really take a step back and look at what we would do
5384600 there seem to be a lot of them out there and from our experience a lot of them are not very good
5384601 a lot of times the consulting firms are so dead set on upselling

5384604 the greatest love ever shown does not speak the instinctively self centered language of the recipients of such love
5384605 i believe in america america has made my fortune i gave my daughter her freedom and yet taught her never to dishonor her family
5384606 she found a boyfriend not an italian she went to the movies with him she stayed out late but he never came to meet her parents i accepted all this without a protest the fault is mine
5384607 she was the light of my life an affectionate daughter a beautiful girl she trusted people and now she will never trust them again then after a pause he continues
5384608 we have known each other for many years you and i but until this day you never came to me for counsel or help i cant remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee though my wife is godmother to your only child let us be frank you spurned my friendship you feared to be in my debt
5384609 no dont speak you found america a paradise you had a good trade you made a good living you thought the world a harmless place where you could take your pleasure as you willed you never armed yourself with true friends after all the police guarded you there were courts of law you and yours come to no harm you did not need don corleone very well my feelings were wounded but i am not that sort of person who thrusts friendship on those who do not value it on those who think me of little account
5384610 now you come to me and ask don corleone give me justice
5384611 i wanted to be a good citizen i wanted my child to be an american
5384612 they gave the youths justice they did not give me justice
5384613 good you shall have your justice some day and that day may never come i will call upon you to do a service in return until that day consider this justice a gift from my wife your daughters godmother
5384614 of statutes in rome statues of those roman emperors of antiquity who by divine right held the power of life and death over throw their fellow men
5384615 don corleone insists and his status depends on his insisting that the relationship between himself and his subordinates is more than merely contractual in fact is is not contractual at all it is moral and quasi familial in the classic understanding friends are like kin they are ones own
5384616 so perfect and entire that few such can ever be read about and no tract at all of it can be found among men today
5384617 sharing out property or dividing it up with the wealth of one becoming the poverty of the other can wondrously melt and weaken the solder binding brothers together
5384618 you must proceed from wisdom and caution keeping the reins in your hands the bond is not so well tied that there is no reason to doubt it
5384619 love a friend as though some day you must hate him hate him as though you must love him
5384620 those that want friends to open themselves unto are cannibals of their own hearts
5384621 a natural and secret hatred and aversion towards society in any man hath somewhat of the savage beast
5384622 it is a mere and miserable solitude to want true friends
5384623 much beholden to machiavelli and others that write what men do and not what they ought to do
5384624 to go behind to the effectual truth of the matter rather than to that matter as represented in the imagination
5384625 have imagined republics and principalities which have never been seen or known to exist in truth
5384626 he who abandons that which is done in favor of that which in favor of that which ought to be done learns rather his ruin than his preservation

5384628 presuppose that all men are wicked and that they will make use of the malignity of their spirit whenever they are free and have occasion to do so
5384629 have not considered how it is that in every republic there are two diverse humors that of the people popolo and that of the great ones grandi and that all the laws that are made in favor of liberty are born this disunion
5384630 good examples arise from good education good education from good laws and good laws from the tumults which many so inconsistently condemn
5384631 the demands of a free people are seldom pernicious and rarely endanger their liberty
5384632 they arise from oppression ro from the suspicions they entertain that they are about to be oppressed and then those opinions are false there is a remedy in the public assemblies where a good man can stand up and in speaking demonstrate to the people that they are in error
5384633 every city have modes by which people can vent their ambition
5384634 the spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that i wish it to be always kept alive
5384635 under pretence of governing they have divided their nations into two classes wolf and sheep
5384636 you and i and congress and assemblies judges and governors shall all become wolves it seems to be the law of our general nature nature in spite of individual exceptions and experience declares that man is the only animal which devours his own kind
5384637 free government is founded in jealousy and not in confidence
5384638 it is jealousy and not confidence which prescribes limited constitutions to bind down those whom we are obliged to trust with power
5384639 construction of difference as a form of group homogeneity that brooks no disagreement or distinction within and can maintain itself only as a redoubt against threatening enemies from without

5384727 i continued on cutting steadily and surmounting bump after bump and cornice after cornice looking eagerly for the summit it seemed impossible to pick it and time was running out finally i cut around the back of an extra large hump and then on a tight rope from tensing i climbed up a gentle snow ridge to its top immediately it was obvious that we had reached our objective it was 11 30a m and we were on top of everest
5384728 tensing and i shook hands and then tensing threw his arms around my shoulders it was a great moment i took off my oxygen and for ten minutes i photographed tensing holding flags the various ridges of everest and the general view i left a crucifix on top for john hunt and tensing made a little hole in the snow and put in it some food offerings lollies biscuits and chocolate we ate mint cake and then put our oxygen back on i was a little worried by the time factor so after 15 minutes on top we turned back at 11 45

5384739 you know it turns out a lot of other people want your fan too can we use your tooling to produce it for them
5384740 sure talk to our manufacturing guy and i am sure he will arrange something
5384741 via our deep understanding of your needs we knew you needed this new type of fan and so of course we developed it for you our beloved customers

5384747 its okay and they said i could stay here a bit if i liked
5384748 would you like to stay awhile im in the mood for a talk
5384749 its okay really its nice to have a man stare at me again
5384750 i probably should put on a bra when you are around now i feel self conscious
5384751 no you dont have to do that im sorry i looked
5384752 really i like it that you were looking at me josh
5384753 i tell you what josh if you promise to keep this our secret ill let you see my breasts but
5384754 you have to promise josh if anyone found out i could go to jail do you understand
5384755 your parents have never come into my house without knocking
5384756 we can go upstairs to the bathroom that way if anyone were to barge in then i could go into my bedroom and you could shut the bathroom door like you were using the toilet
5384757 fair is fair josh let me run my hand over your crotch
5384758 use your other hand take both my breasts in your hands and squeeze them
5384759 thats enough for now i dont want you to get too excited and mess your jeans
5384760 we had better cool it a bit so that your jeans can go back to normal but i am going to make some rules
5384761 we crossed a line tonight do you understand that josh
5384762 good now whenever you come over you can look at my breasts they are yours for the taking but you have to control yourself you have to be discrete about it and you can never tell anyone not even your best friends
5384763 i think you have fantastic breasts tammy you are a very beautiful woman thats what i was thinking when i was um looking down your shirt earlier
5384764 how big do you think my breasts are josh do you know about stuff like that
5384765 my guess is that you are a 36c am i close
5384766 go upstairs to my room josh turn on the light and then go to my dresser the top middle drawer has my bras and panties in it bring me a white bra ill show you how to tell what size it is and then you will know what size i am
5384767 yeah im glad ive got these boobs they help balance out my fat
5384768 no tammy i think youre beautiful dont call yourself that
5384769 when you get older it takes your eyes longer to acclimate to new glasses
5384770 older americans discover they have aches and pains they never had before suddenly they have symptoms that catch them by surprise and cause them worry and concern using the free resources at http www 50pluswebhealth com can help them figure out if they should visit a health care professional or not
5384771 many individuals suffer from health issues and are not aware they have them identifying the symptoms and obtaining care from the appropriate health professional would lead to a much healthier and happy life
5384772 weight loss getting in shape with exercise and fitness programs better nutrition saving money on health care costs annual health exams and other health care concerns are foremost on the minds of adults over 50 as they set goals for new year resolutions
5384773 better informed consumers are empowered to choose and use products we regulate to improve our health
5384774 because physician visits that result in earlier detection of a disease combined with appropriate treatment could mean that more people will live longer lives without the risk of future costly medical intervention

5384776 i wanted to mix the concept behind isos 7 over two separate sets in such a fashion that the listeners can get a proper impression of what it means to tour asia
5384777 disc one will dwell on the easy going ambience and overwhelming beauty of the continent whereas the second disc will focus on the incredible energy of the asian people i felt during the live sets throughout the asian tour
5384778 whether the frogs are good or bad is a matter of opinion but one thing seems certain the frogs are in hawaii and are here to stay for some this means war for others this means acceptance
5384779 some people consider coqui frogs in hawaii to be invasive aliens that threaten the environment and the quality of life others consider the frogs exotic immigrants who can improve the environment and quality of life in hawaii
5384780 some people hate the nighttime mating song of the frogs which keeps them awake others enjoy the coquis bird like chirp and find that it soothes them to sleep like the sound of crickets
5384781 panic in paradise invasive species hysteria and the hawaiian coqui frog war
5384782 i think whats happening is were slowly seeing a transition to another generation of potential customers its a customer who is more interested in an urban lifestyle within their home than an actual urban geographic location its cleaner lines cleaner finishes and less encumbered
5384783 bracingly different from coldplay hits like clocks and speed of sound with darker lyrics distorted guitars and more prominent percussion and much less use of martins trademark falsetto vocals
5384784 often turns on the structural similarities and differences between the claimed compound and the prior art compounds
5384785 by identification of some motivation that would have led one of ordinary skill in the art to select and then modify a known compound i
5384786 shows no discernible reason for a skilled artisan to begin with lansoprazole only to drop the very feature that gave this advantageous property
5384787 may present a difficult hurdle because potential solutions are less likely to be genuinely predictable
5384788 this liberal will be all about socializing uh uh would be about basically taking over and the government running all of your companies
5384789 the united states minister assigned to the sovereign and independent kingdom of hawaii conspired with a small group of non hawaiian residents of the kingdom of hawaii including citizens of the united states to overthrow the indigenous and lawful government of hawaii
5384790 it is difficult to overestimate the effect a bad boss has in a workplace but its just as easy to undervalue the effect of a good boss a survey by yahoo hotjobs reveals that 43 percent of american workers would leave their jobs if they didnt like the supervisors management style or were not given adequate mentoring in their jobs

5384794 there was always something to do even if it was only kickball in front of the house there was always a game to participate in i played softball on the little league team it sparked my interest
5384795 we played volleyball and basketball together she was very physically fit she was very athletic competitive
5384796 she seems to have found her niche sometimes you do all these sports and then you hit it just right
5384797 because she was the youngest and had three brothers she would get outside and tumble with the rest of them
5384798 the people of this state are tired of negative campaigning tired of inter party bickering
5384799 is it aggressive absolutely does it cross the line not necessarily
5384800 you dont get very far in politics without have a thick skin
5384801 sometimes things are said in the primary and sometimes during the general election that you wish they hadnt said those things but you move on
5384802 even if theres a contentious run off there wont be 100 democrats who will be so upset they wont vote or will vote for a republican
5384803 having been out four years well be anxious to get behind whoever the nominee is
5384804 i adopted the habit of taking a sample with me on my rounds the morning after my distillations macerations and filtrations encouraged by the comments and wishes of my tasters i honed my product enabling me to continue my enquiry the following morning at another bar

5384806 there is a risk that patients who are desperate will misunderstand the level of development of the field
5384807 they will assume that therapies are here or are just around the corner
5384808 outside of the blood system there are no established stem cell therapies
5384809 these kinds of clinics do pose a real risk to public safety
5384810 its important that these guidelines are international and are well thought through
5384811 the isscr condemns the administration of stem cells or their direct derivatives to patients as unproven medical innovation outside of a clinical trial particularly when patients in these circumstances are charged for advertised medical services
5384812 the book was to be dedicated to the presidents of two countries men who had been his clients whom i respected and thought of as kindred spirits jaime rold s president of ecuador and omar torrijos president of panama
5384813 i was persuaded to stop writing that book i started it four more times during the next twenty years on each occasion my decision to begin again was influenced by current world events the u s invasion of panama in 1980 the first gulf war somalia and the rise of osama bin laden however threats or bribes always convinced me to stop
5384814 i think we are on the right track but we need to understand more about the mechanism
5384815 my mother gladys successfully used this idea with me thirty years ago which led to twenty nine days in treatment and a life of recovery there are ways to encourage someone to reach for help much earlier and by doing so we can avoid a lot of unnecessary pain and heartache and maybe even save their life for some people hitting bottom will be six feet underground
5384816 does everyone have to hit rock bottom i would say no tough love can prevent a substance abuser from prolonging their usage there are loving ways to refuse to rescue someone that in the long run will help him or her to choose recovery loving means doing the right thing to help this can take all of our strength and energy at times we all hate to see someone suffer even when the suffering is a consequence of his or her bad choices this approach or some form of it is something you might consider raise the bottom the next time this person you care about appeals to you to get them out of a bind loan them money pay their electric bill buy them gas pay for a lawyer think twice you just might be prolonging their disease and robbing them of the natural consequences that they need to experience in order to seek help and begin to connect the dots
5384817 the hottest media property is now footage of irwins death and an interview with his widow
5384818 theres a major difference in the immune response depending on whether the cells are genetically identical
5384819 you need a special set of expertise that is typically not available in an individual lab
5384820 we now hope to interest pharmaceutical or biotech companies into developing partnerships to develop new treatments we really believe that we are onto something important
5384821 after all the controversy about using embryonic stem cells this shows how potentially important such research is
5384822 the paper clearly shows that factors which probably promote human embryonic stem cell proliferation are important in controlling tumour cell behaviour
5384823 this provides a novel target for developing tumour cell therapies
5384824 i think its fascinating to think you can take a cell put it in a dish and 12 to 14 days later you get populations that are contracting human heart cells
5384825 its extremely interesting to think about having one cell that could do it all
5384826 this gives us an endless supply of human heart cells
5384827 the next step will be to derive the master heart cells from normal human tissue murry says last year researchers in the us and japan transformed ordinary human cells into stem cells called induced pluripotent stem cells ips with ips cells scientists could make heart cells from a patients own tissue avoiding the risk of immune rejection

5384829 the man has power and he is very intractable february 3 he called for what he called the friday of wrath resulting in a tightening of the boycott since the imams listen to him
5384830 they are probably not there to say that everything is dandy their demands have far from been met because they still need to get an apology
5384831 we cant avoid mentioning the decision of the crowns prosecutor which will probably provoke some well have to wait and see how the conference progresses and i think the input from denmark will be essential i cant say what the result of the conference will be and i havent discussed strategy with the other delegates but i expect to talk about the decision at the conference and how i as a danish moslem view the signals sent by the crowns prosecutor
5384832 it is very disturbing that this disagreeable group of extremist and unreliable imams has yet again set out to hurt denmarks cause
5384833 i am willing to urge that the boycott of danish goods be stopped but if yusuf al qaradawi and other respected scholars are of a different opinion i cant imagine that my voice will be listened to
5384834 we love our troops so much that we want them to die

5384878 erm kak afrah mana ummi bakal raja sehari ni tak nampak pula dari tadi
5384879 dalam bilik agaknya tadi ummi nampak dia tengah ambil wudhu mungkin tengah solat
5384880 aik solat apa lepas asar ni solat isthikarah untuk ustaz khairul ke
5384881 adik akak ni bila sampai senyap je dah habis belajar baru nak balik ye
5384882 wan walaupun hampir pasti akak menjadi zaujah ustaz khairul tidak salahkan kalau akak terus meminta petunjuk daripada allah
5384883 insyaallah wan tak salah apa apa akak tak tersinggung cuma suka akak ingatkan wan harus berhati hati apabila berkata jika terkena pada orang yang hendak kita bawa pada islam mungkin mereka akan lari
5384884 wan lupakah allah pernah berfirman dalam surah al anfal ayat 21 yang bermaksud maka dengan sebab rahmat yang melimpah limpah daripada allah kepadamu wahai muhammad engkau telah bersikap lemah lembut kepada mereka sahabat sahabat dan pengikutmu dan kalaulah engkau bersikap kasar lagi keras hati tentulah mereka lari dari kelilingmu

5384888 sabar itu juga merupakan buah iman dia tidak akan lahir melainkan dengan kekuatan iman dan kesanggupan melemahkan nafsu marah ketika kita nak marah tu la allah nak uji kita
5384889 anak anak abi yang soleh jangan sedih sedih semua ni tengok apa abi bawa ni rezeki dari allah
5384890 akan ku buat musuh gentar denganmu dengan kebengisanmu biarlah marahmu garangmu pada musuh islam bukan pada adik adikmu insyaallah kinah allah bersama kita

5384898 i want to make clear to the chinese people but there is no way to make known these things
5384899 totally fucked up they cant face reality they cant face the down of not having the adrenaline pump
5384900 a chilly negative mood activates a battle stations mode of thinking the order of the day is to focus on what is wrong and then eliminate it a positive mood in contrast buoys people into a way of thinking that is creative tolerant constructive generous undefensive and lateral this way of thinking probably even occurs in a different part of the brain and has a different neurochemistry from thinking under negative mood
5384901 when we are in a positive mood people like us better and friendship love and coalitions are more likely to cement in contrast to the constrictions of negative emotion our mental set is expansive tolerant and creative we are open to new ideas and new experience
5384902 does it have all of the features id expect from word excel and powerpoint
5384903 can it open ms office documents and save documents in office formats
5384904 i think its a pretty good timetable as we should or horizons for withdrawal
5384905 but they have to be based on conditions on the ground
5384906 what is going on between 1 09 to about 1 13 on the right side
5384907 said dieter goldmann who organizes agriculture trips and tours from hanau germany the group of 21 breeders will be led by eiso busemann who said they will make the 4 000 mile trip to see bulls firsthand before buying semen
5384908 literature is great but the experience is a lot of the benefit of dairy expo
5384909 it s extremely important to meet new potential partners in the rest of the world
5384910 i think we can talk about a global dairy industry all we want and it truly is
5384911 but nothing drives it home that world dairy expo is a global dairy event more than when you see all of those red ribbons
5384912 he said during the trip the group will also visit several farms in southern wisconsin and the accelerated genetics semen production facility in westby
5384913 we want to catch up with production and technology and have our space in the dairy industry
5384914 we need a lot of accurate information for the developing sector here because we really lost a lot of time
5384915 there is a lot of technology that is missing here
5384916 i don t anticipate seeing as many people from the pacific rim particularly australia just given the horrific drought that country is experiencing
5384917 when you know people on a global basis you can empathize with them
5384918 it makes the industry seem a lot smaller and in this day and age with e mail and text messaging you feel like they re your next door neighbors not half a planet away

5384927 khalid sheikh mohammed is in the custody of pakistans law enforcement agencies and until we have satisfied ourselves after the interrogation process of the nature of his activities in pakistan there is no question of handing him over to anyone
5384928 only when khalids country approaches us and makes a formal request for his extradition only then will the pakistani government hand him over
5384929 give no guarantee mohammed still will be in pakistan tomorrow
5384930 there is no god except allah mohammed is his messenger
5384931 pro taliban elements of pakistans military might warn bin ladin sic or his associates of pending operations
5384932 dramatic changes were made in the final draft of the inquiry commission report after pakistani lobbyists arranged meetings with members of the commission and convinced them to remove anti pakistan findings
5384933 we were talking about terrorism specifically terrorism generated from afghanistan

5384935 at the meeting abbas said americans are the enemy and they will have no problem blowing up this entire restaurant because its full of americans
5384936 as we leave the restaurant abbas turns and says those towers the world trade center are coming down
5384937 mahmouds involvement in september 11 might be dismissed as only indian propaganda but indian intelligence swears by it and the us federal bureau of investigation fbi has confirmed the whole story indian intelligence even supplied saeeds cellular phone numbers
5384938 the idea would be to disrupt the skin to trigger the embryonic pathways and then come in with the wnt proteins
5384939 there are some 400 000 leftover unwanted embryos in fertility clinics across america
5384940 all we are saying is instead of throwing those leftover embryos away lets allow couples to donate a few of them if they wish to create stem cell lines that could cure diseases and save lives
5384941 i strongly support this bill and i encourage the congress to pass it and send it to me for my signature so stem cell science can progress without ethical and cultural conflict
5384942 we are now in a position to be able to generate patient and disease specific stem cells without using human eggs or embryos
5384943 these cells should be useful in understanding disease mechanisms searching for effective and safe drugs and treating patients with cell therapy
5384944 we have to find a way to avoid retroviruses before application in cell therapy
5384945 but this isnt over by a long shot its extremely important to temper the excitement with caution
5384946 the fda would never allow us to use these virally modified cells in patients
5384947 having two ways to re programme might help us understand how reprogramming works
5384948 but we should be careful not to abandon embryo research altogether its always best to keep all avenues of research open to maximise chances of success
5384949 like everything publicised ahead of time its hard to work out exactly what theyve done
5384950 i dont think it would have been approved in the us
5384951 without an understanding that life begins at conception and that an embryo is a nascent human being there will always be arguments that other uses takeovers and make overs of embryos are justified by potential scientific and medical benefits
5384952 we got a super majority under the republican controlled 109th congress
5384953 when the senate passes this bill the president is going to be under incredible pressure to acknowledge that the science has changed and to acknowledge that the american people support this research
5384954 this latest work is the first time anyone has implanted embryonic stem cell derived pneumocytes into animals
5384955 it may be that they become insulin free for life we dont know
5384956 it could be due to differences in genetic background or severity of the immune attack
5384957 if we used this method in the clinic it would raise ethical concerns
5384958 before we get too excited about this being a new form of infertility treatment these cells cannot as yet be made into functioning sperm so we have no idea if they can pass the acid test the ability to fertilise female eggs as is achieved with donor sperm in ivf treatment
5384959 unfortunately these stem cell manipulations can lead to permanent genetic changes which would make them unsafe to use especially as a potential sperm or egg
5384960 it should be perfectly possible for fully functional mature sperm cells to be made from these female derived cells too
5384961 we have shown that cells can be generated by these four factors that are indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells
5384962 here we have defined conditions and you can observe what is going on
5384963 we dont know whether human cells can be reprogrammed at all
5384964 if you were using this method to create human escs that could be used in therapy there would be concerns
5384965 one possibility is that there is a minority of cells that are more susceptible to reprogramming than others
5384966 i dont know whether this will be doable in the next few years or in my lifetime
5384967 there is a real possibility of doing this much more systematically to get some kind of understanding of what happens to cells when they undergo differentiation
5384968 we are starting to find what is in that black box
5384969 this confirms what many of us have suspected for a long time that early stage embryos can still reprogram cells
5384970 we now have a clear idea that they are nuclear factors
5384971 they are a missing link between mouse and human embryonic stem cells
5384972 was is it the evolutionary divergence of mice and men or was there a developmental explanation reflecting different stages of growth
5384973 comparative analyses suggest that the new cells may have more in common with human embryo stem cells
5384974 these are exciting findings that hint at ways in which it may be possible to alter the culture conditions for human embryo stem cells in order to make their maintenance more straightforward and malleable
5384975 shed light on the origin and nature of human embryonic stem cells
5384976 if you look at what is happening today and what is in the pipeline i think genetic modification of stem cells is going to be a major theme
5384977 were looking to move this into clinical trials by early 2009
5384978 you can really generate a shuttle for your enzyme into the nervous system
5384979 people are excited about the potential of stem cells but most approaches are not leveraging them to their maximum potential

5384981 the idea is to try and restart natural signals that initiate repair
5384982 the mechanism to activate cardiac regeneration is present but its inadequate
5384983 could that be because mammals dont have enough heart stem cells we need to understand what is holding the system back so that we can devise a strategy to turn that brake off
5384984 the most important question now is can you identify that new pool are they pre existing immature cardiac muscle cells or are they stem cells from the heart or elsewhere in the body

5384988 my name is saeed till recently i was a university student majoring in archaeology i like archaeology a lot but the perspective of becoming a scientist and getting buried under a pile of ancient books did not please me half a year ago i discovered in myself the talent of a great poker player i got involved into playing money and im telling you i was not bad at that a month ago i participated in a large private tournament the stakes were high and i had to borrow a large amount ive lost the game

5384993 people put the tornado in they are so happy with the product they tell a friend
5384994 during those tests we splice a fuel meter into the line run them through very strict tests so we really get to know whether these things work or they dont
5384995 we tested it on two cars it made no difference at all
5384996 we tested it on two cars made no difference at all
5384997 well two means nothing we can show you in our own test data i can show you two vehicles one that got 12 percent worse and one that only improved by 7 percent but if you take all 42 vehicles what you see is an improvement of between 20 and 28 percent
5384998 the vehicle sits there on the floor and the rear wheels are rotating on cylinders
5384999 therefore no platinum is going to get dispensed therefore im not surprised they wouldnt see any results even if they did a test
5385000 obviously what were doing is obviously scientifically and testwise correct
5385001 we have three vested interests who dont like us the oil companies the car companies because we double engine life and the cigarette companies because i was involved in the first litigation that they lost
5385002 my school has become an eco school an eco school is a normal school but it also tries to make the environment better for people in the future how we help we have lots of ways of helping the environment we have an eco monitor in each class they make sure the lights are switched off around the school each class takes turns at litter picking on a friday and the school keeps a chart to see if the amount of litter goes down we also keep another chart to see if the amount of electricity gas and water we use has gone down we have a paper recycling bin where we put scrap paper our school council is also trying to think of new ways to save the environment hope for future we have been doing this for about a year now i really hope that everyone will carry on doing it

5385007 sterling was interested in finding a professional that could not only cultivate relationships but also be credit trained so as to offer solid guidance for businesses looking for financing
5385008 after negotiating among themselves without the involvement of yahoo carl icahn and microsoft presented us with a take it or leave it proposal under which we would be required to restructure the company hand over to microsoft yahoo s valuable search business and to carl icahn the rest of the company giving us less than 24 hours to respond it is ludicrous to think that our board could accept such a proposal while this type of erratic and unpredictable behavior is consistent with what we have come to expect from microsoft we will not be bludgeoned into a transaction that is not in the best interests of our stockholders
5385009 would be interested in discussing with a new board a major transaction with yahoo such as either a transaction to purchase the search function with large financial guarantees or in the alternative purchasing the whole company
5385010 enter into discussions immediately after yahoos shareholder meeting if a new board is elected
5385011 completely absurd and irresponsible given the complexity of the deal one that requires the removal of half of yahoo s business from yahoo and then the integration of it into microsoft
5385012 for the up to the one year it would take to gain regulatory approval
5385013 this odd and opportunistic alliance of microsoft and carl icahn has anything but the interests of yahoo s stockholders in mind clearly microsoft having failed to advance in search is aligning with the short term objectives of mr icahn to coerce yahoo into selling its core strategic search assets on terms that are highly advantageous to microsoft but disadvantageous to yahoo stockholders yahoos board of directors will not allow that to happen

5385016 im not going to comment specifically on what russian units or equipment are in the area right now
5385017 but let me be clear if it rolled in after august 6th it needs to roll out that would be in keeping with the russians commitment on withdrawal
5385018 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of this cease fire and should be removed immediately
5385019 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before

5385033 what the boycott of mcdonalds is not about this boycott is not about hiring homosexuals it is not about homosexuals eating at mcdonalds it is not about how homosexual employees are treated what the boycott of mcdonalds is about it is about mcdonalds as a corporation refusing to remain neutral in the culture wars mcdonalds has chosen not to remain neutral but to give the full weight of their corporation to promoting the homosexual agenda including homosexual marriage
5385034 thank you for an informative and interesting article i never knew that mcdonalds supported same sex marriage without this website i would have never have known
5385035 i used to be gay but then i found out that it was because i ate at mcdonalds once i stopped eating at mickeyds my red blooded heterosexuality came storming back
5385036 right on i dont support same sex marriage either and it disgusts me that mcdonalds would have the big shiny sinful balls to throw money at the cause
5385037 taking over the world one human right at a time
5385038 i wanted to personally report that i have been very recently diagnosed with an advanced stage of squamous cell carcinoma of the mouth i have consulted several prominent physicians and will likely begin aggressive treatment within the next few weeks i remain and will remain actively and optimistically engaged in operations at alinea to the largest extent possible alinea will continue to perform at the level people have come to expect from us i insist on that i have received amazing support from friends family and everyone who has thus far been told of the disease and i look forward to a full cancer free recovery
5385039 weve now gone one stage further in showing that once integrated these new neurons are able to reverse cognitive deficits associated with neurodegeneration or neuronal loss
5385040 but mscs are also recruited into tumours possibly using the same recruitment mechanisms as those operating during wound healing
5385041 it is highly likely although still speculative that these recruitment and signalling mechanisms will operate in a variety of other tumours
5385042 they have revealed new way of communication between mesenchymal cells ands tumours and identified the importance of ccl5
5385043 this is opening a completely new field which could be interesting what other types of tumours are stimulated by mscs
5385044 the trouble is there are few good models of human breast cancer metastasis in a mouse
5385045 even if we find mscs in a primary human breast cancer they may be in a different context than suggested by this model
5385046 the researchers comment that the cytokine ccl5 is not involved in metastasis of the mcf7 ras cell line which is a well characterised breast cancer line in other words the best breast cancer cell line we have doesnt fit their model
5385047 i would still like to see more studies on the role of ccl5 they find it has no effect on the survival of cancer cells so how does it help in metastasis
5385048 a lot more needs to be done before we understand the association if there is one between mscs and tumours
5385049 you cant just go and grab a cell from a patient with a particular disease and have it have that marker in it
5385050 there are indicators that they could be used for first or second degree relatives or beyond
5385051 id always thought the body wouldnt want to be shedding too many stem cells
5385052 martin evans certainly was one of the pioneers being the first to derive mouse escs in 1981
5385053 it brings home the importance of stem cell biology for the future of medicine
5385054 the development of gene targeting technology in the mouse has had a profound influence on medical research
5385055 thanks to this technology we have a much better understanding of the function of specific genes in pathways in the whole organism and a greater ability to predict whether drugs acting on those pathways will be beneficial
5385056 its good to see that despite the controversy embryonic stem cell research has been recognised with a nobel prize
5385057 it probably wont change bushs personal viewpoint but might prompt a future us government to release federal funds for esc research
5385058 the message to the world is loud and clear despite the brouhaha and opposition surrounding stem cell research the field has been recognised as being profoundly important to the advancement of science and medicine
5385059 its here and now and could increase massively the number of stem cells available
5385060 we could triple the number of hesc lines available within a few months
5385061 weve been in dialogue with the white house and its our understanding that they would wait until a peer reviewed paper appeared before approving our approach
5385062 its designed to appease people who oppose embryo research despite the fact that thousands of ivf embryos are discarded each year
5385063 the clock is ticking and it keeps getting held up and held up
5385064 can one prove that the biopsied embryos if implanted would yield normal individuals
5385065 opponents might claim even sillier arguments that the embryos are donating cells without informed consent
5385066 given the facts this is the only conclusion the pto could have reached the patents should never have been issued in the first place
5385067 we are currently pursuing the generation of embryonic stem cell lines from embryos generated using our protocols
5385068 this study demonstrates for the first time that scnt can be utilised to generate cloned human blastocysts using differentiated adult donor nuclei remodelled and reprogrammed by human oocytes
5385069 the data we present are not in any way the final word on the topic
5385070 the results verified for the first time through dna and mitochondrial dna fingerprinting that of the five blastocysts only one had the donor cell genomic dna and the oocyte mitochondrial dna
5385071 although these results are preliminary since no stem cell lines have been derived from the cloned embryos this may now be attempted
5385072 cow eggs seem to be every bit as good at doing this job as human eggs so it makes sense to use them since they are much more readily available
5385073 its very significant that theyve done it with skin cells
5385074 i think the tiny number of eggs from women would preclude medical use
5385075 our ultimate aim is to replicate the reprogramming the egg does but without the egg

5385089 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
5385090 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference

5385093 obamas shifting stance on space exploration is indicative of his inexperience on issues important to voters
5385094 lets be honest obama is only embracing nasa now because of his political problems in florida
5385095 something that is elemental and a vital part of our space program
5385096 i think weve got to sort out our priorities better in other words we cant do everything
5385097 to maintain a robust program of human space exploration and continue our nations pre eminence in space
5385098 considering obamas shifting positions he cannot be trusted to fully support nasas mission to mars
5385099 the only thing barack obama knows about sending a man to the moon is that its a good applause line

5385107 vendor management solidifies partnerships and relationships between customers and vendors without it theres a gap in the relationship
5385108 if you look back 10 years some would see vendor management as unnecessary overhead perhaps using it to actually cut back on the number of vendors used by the bank to save money
5385109 today vendors are seen as an extension of the banks in delivering services to their customers so they have to be held to the same rigorous standards as the bank
5385110 because of glba all parts of the process must be accounted for
5385111 you can outsource responsibility to a third party but not liability
5385112 so financial institutions have to treat them like they are in house
5385113 glb hipaa and sox each have significant penalties for failure to protect data
5385114 these have all conspired to make vendor management a front burner issue
5385115 the increasing migration of payments toward electronic means where a system could potentially store customer information or other sensitive data has led to the increased awareness of vendor management and its importance
5385116 there is a risk component involved in these systems that could potentially store sensitive information
5385117 a lot of our work is it services that are offshored so its imperative for the banks to oversee this especially with the risk management involved
5385118 know this for a certainty that today the penetrative power in the arteries of the world of humanity is the power of the covenant the body of the world will not be moved through any power except through the power of the covenant there is no other power like unto this this spirit of the covenant is the real center of love and is reflecting its rays to all parts of the globe which are resuscitating and regenerating man and illuminating the path to the divine kingdom

5385124 it appears that a piece of data has been used multiple times to represent different things

5385127 is still the 5 most downloaded paper on ssrn what lead him to write it
5385128 i thought it would be a funny joke to write about something i was really enjoying and was finding meaningful which was playing in everquest

5385131 whats happens if second life comes to occupy the time of hundreds of millions of people whats going to happen on the outside thats what ive been thinking about a lot in the past 2 3 years

5385134 dont cultural and family pressures have as much to do with it as economics how do the structural frictions differ
5385135 can you get a computer that will load second life and does your internet connection have enough bandwidth
5385136 theres something about the way were wired that produces our interest in tetris the horse game the assassin thing leveling in world of warcraft and on and on so there really needs to be research to unpack that i think
5385137 when i first got interested in second life in 2003 04 it was largely empty
5385138 theres so much similarity in the way a virtual world development company thinks about what theyre doing and interfaces with their populace and executes policy
5385139 what do you mean youre implementing the changes in the game servers without testing
5385140 we have millions of people who in their formative years got the idea through gaming that if you need money theres someone standing around handing out quests to anyone who asks this isnt true in the real world but theyll feel like it should be

5385142 we have millions of people who in their formative years got the idea through gaming that if you need money theres someone standing around handing out quests to anyone who asks this isnt true in the real world but theyll feel like it should be

5385144 the recent flooding and heavy rains in britain will have made people more aware of the dangers of extreme weather
5385145 even with all of the possible worst case scenario statistics included our calculations can not be combined to create a wave that could pass over the top of the thames barrier the defences that we have in place can presently cope with the worst that can realistically be thrown at it but of course it is right that we plan for the future to ensure that this level of protection is at least maintained in the decades to come the thames barrier protects 125 square km of central london encompassing 1 25 million people and an infrastructure valued at 80bn
5385146 the best way to create a programme about an unpredictable scenario like this one is to work with the real life experts the thames barrier is a structure admired the world over for its efficiency and resilience our production may be a work of fiction but it has served to highlight the challenges and investment needed to maintain effective flood management programmes in the uk
5385147 central london is very well protected thanks to the thames barrier to the east and teddington weir to the west
5385148 but given the uncertainty created by climate change and the intensity of some of the downpours weve had recently it is only prudent to review our plans

5385171 weve received over 4 000 signatures for gordon brown on fifth birthday cards to push for more to be done to save childrens lives including as many as 20 of all the camp bestival goers last month if we can continue to have the same impressive levels of response throughout the summer as we tour the festivals we hope well be giving children around the world a real reason to celebrate on their fifth birthdays
5385172 the big chill is a great family day out at save the children we want families to know more about the many ways they can help save childrens lives we hope that people will join us in herefordshire this weekend to take part in simple actions which can help stop millions of children dying before the age of five each year

5385200 mental health is now firmly on the agenda for all governments and people do have better access to psychological talking therapies however there was not much evidence that services were better integrated or that teamwork between doctors psychologists psychiatrists and nurses had improved
5385201 we remain convinced that community based primary mental health centres staffed by skilled multidisplinary teams would improve expertise and responsiveness to immediate needs
5385202 with so many players in funding and program delivery knowing whether this money is delivering quantity and quality of services through measurable outcomes and the regular collection of data is difficult but crucial
5385203 state and territory government have not yet truly engaged with the critical issue of accommodation and employment which is fundamental to the recovery journey for people with mental illness
5385204 progress on the engagement of consumers and carers in services is also too slow as is the capacity to deal with people affected by drug and alcohol dependence and mental illness
5385205 some excellent models of care exist but these are by no means universal and people are still being turned away
5385206 drinking game that is played in the pubs and bars of the far east it reminds me of a lite version of poker but played with dice and it uses a really unique scoring system its named after a local delicacy fertilized duck eggs that is often consumed while drinking at these establishments think of them as peanuts but much much larger and of course with tiny little beaks

5385208 er bereikt het bericht dat hugo ch vez zich drie van de zes antillen heeft toege igend zijn troepen zouden vanochtend om zeven uur nederlandse tijd geland zijn op het strand van cura ao en er zouden ook slachtoffers zijn gevallen we proberen verbinding te maken met het gebied maar alle lijnen zijn uitgevallen wat we wel hebben is een politieke verklaring van president ch vez van venezuela die hij via de staatstelevisie heeft afgegeven
5385209 hugo ch vez is nogal trots op zn land zo blijkt dit is venezuela dit is ons territorium zeg chavez hier en deze eilanden horen binnen de tweehonderd zeemijlen die bij onze kust horen en verder zei hij
5385210 koning van de republiek dat is de ambitie van chavez inclusief aruba bonaire en cura ao en we krijgen ook bericht dat we een reactie hebben van onze bevelhebber van de strijdkrachten ter plaatse
5385211 vandaag hebben we te maken gehad met een laffe smerige terroristendaad eigenlijk een soort wanhoopsdaad van de tegenstander die nergens succes heeft kunnen behalen en op deze terroristische manier proberen toch nog in de publiciteit te komen plotseling gebeurt zoiets dat is het frustrerende ja hier kun je weinig tegen doen
5385212 en ook vanuit den haag wordt inmiddels gereageerd minister van defensie van middelkoop heeft inmiddels een eerste reactie gegeven
5385213 het is nog altijd onrustig het valt niet te ontkennen dat er goed gevochten is en met effect maar dit zijn inderdaad spannende dagen
5385214 er zou dus ook gevochten zijn door nederlandse militairen volgens de minister zijn er ook burgerslachtoffers te betreuren
5385215 het is zeer te betreuren geen misverstand erover wat hier gebeurd is is buitengewoon vervelend als er vier mensen omkomen dan is dat een zeer betreurenswaardige zaak
5385216 we hebben inmiddels ook verbinding gekregen met defensiespecialist rob de wijk van tno tja wat staat nederland te doen diplomatie of vechten goedemorgen meneer de wijk
5385217 goede morgen nou ik ben niet van tno hoor maar het den haag centrum voor strategische studies
5385218 ok goed maar uh de antillen ingenomen he wat moet nederland hiertegen doen
5385219 ja vechten zou ik zo zeggen als het inderdaad zo is dat de troepen van venezuela op het strand staan dan heb je ook gewoon de grondwettelijke plicht om je land te verdedigen en dat betekent dat je daar zoveel mogelijk troepen nu naar toe moet zenden want met een paar mariniers kan je het niet af die daar zijn gestationeerd
5385220 nee want er zijn niet heel veel militairen van nederland in het gebied toch nederlandse militairen
5385221 nee die zijn er natuurlijk nooit het is een bijna symbolische troepenmacht bestaande uit bijvoorbeeld mariniers ook een marinier voert het commando daarover een generaal en de belangrijkste taak die ze hebben is toch de strijd tegen de drugs het drugstransport en het internationaal terrorisme
5385222 dat mag je wel zeggen want als die voluit gaan dan mag je nog wel iets meer soldaten dat gebied inbrengen
5385223 die moeten uit nederland komen dat is ongeveer vergelijkbaar met destijds jaren tachtig de falkland crisis dan zal het hele nederlandse vlootverband die richting opstomen inclusief ambfibische transportschepen met troepen en misschien wel tanks erin om ervoor te zorgen dat dus die eilanden versterkt worden maar dan nog
5385224 maar kunnen de amerikanen dan niet helpen want die zijn wel in de buurt
5385225 nou dat hangt er maar vanaf wat er gaat gebeuren kijk je zou denken van wij zijn een navo bondgenoot dus amerikanen moeten ons gewoon helpen er is alleen een vervelend probleem die eilanden van ons liggen beneden de kreeftskeerkring en dat is de zuidelijke grens van het navo verdragsgebied dus er is geen enkele verdragsverplichting voor de amerikanen om ons te helpen dus we moeten maar aardig naar de amerikanen kijken en dan maar hopen of ze ons willen helpen
5385226 ja ja en als ze ons niet te hulp komen hoe kunnen we die oorlog dan winnen want voordat die nederlandse troepen eens een keer daar aangekomen zijn hebben die venezolanen die kleine eilandjes allang
5385227 dan moeten we ze terugveroveren nou dat lukt dus niet denk ik daar zit dus gewoon een geweldig probleem dan krijg je dus blokkades enzo van die eilanden of ja je kunt niet zo gek veel doen
5385228 goede morgen nou ik ben niet van tno hoor maar het den haag centrum voor strategische studies
5385229 in such a position the netherlands would be forced to choose between america and venezuela which in fact wouldnt be a real choice therefore the dutch foreign affairs ministry needs to be very careful about expressing its reactions to the outside world no one can talk to minister verhagen about this subject because in an interview a slip of the tongue is never far away
5385230 voorafgaand aan het gesprek met rob de wijk over chavez en de antillen is een verrassend bedoelde inleiding te horen waarin we suggereren dat venezuala daadwerkelijk de antillen is binnen gevallen een aantal luisteraars kon dit fictieve nieuwsbericht niet waarderen achteraf gezien hadden we deze fragmenten niet in deze vorm op de zender moeten brengen
5385231 the muskegon lake project is an important step towards restoring critical habitat within the region
5385232 weve got a lot of work ahead of us but together well be able to dramatically improve this lake and then move on to other great lakes restoration projects
5385233 for generations people have enjoyed fishing on lake erie swimming in lake michigan and hiking in the forests that surround lake superior
5385234 the effort to restore the great lakes is not just about water its about restoring a resource that millions of people depend on for their drinking water jobs recreational opportunities and quality of life
5385235 the cease fire that was negotiated through egypt was very specific that the hamas movement and the other terrorist groups cant use it as a period to import more weapons more explosives more rockets into the gaza strip

5385244 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5385245 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer

5385281 its unfortunate that the isscr is choosing to water down what was becoming a de facto international standard of prohibiting the payment of women for eggs
5385282 what you need to focus on is not the amount of money changing hands but rather how the financial consideration is affecting the decision the woman goes through
5385283 if it would make the potential donor trivialise any of the risks then it constitutes an undue inducement
5385284 it shows that guidelines and laws are not enough you need effective oversight

5385286 these new encryption modules and systems will enable mission commanders to program security to match mission requirements as well as protect satellites from unauthorized manipulation
5385287 finally the danish governments first reaction rejecting to take an official position on the nature and publication of the cartoons while referring to freedom of speech as well as rejecting to meet with the ambassadors from the moslem countries is symptomatic not only for the political trivialisation of islamophobia but also due to its consequences to the central role those politically responsible have for the national extent and the international consequences in the shape of demonstrations and expressions of islamophobia
5385288 judicially the danish government ought therefore especially considering its international obligations to have respecting freedom of speech taken a position not only on the consequnces of the caricatures for its community of 200 000 moslems but also for the protection of peace and order
5385289 the author of this report cant omit asking himself what the political and ideological national context the publication of the caricatures is a part of and what the position of the danish government is
5385290 moslem immigration as a means to overrun europe the same as theyve been doing the last 1 400 years
5385291 at the end of this report the author has especially been concerned with the development of the position of both the newspaper in question and the government
5385292 finally the author of this report the violent reactions which followed the publication of said caricatures and especially the threats and the attacks on persons in no way related to the publication made targets exclusively due to their nationality also the the threaths against diplomatic representations are to be regretted
5385293 their uncompromising defense of a freedom of speech without limits or restrictions is not in accordance with the international rules which are based on a necessary balance between freedom of speech and freedom of religion especially to combat calls for racial and religious hatred and which all the member countries of un have decided are the basic rules for human rights this attitude shows an alarming lack of sensitivity and understanding of the religious conviction and deep emotions of the groups of society in question thus the newspapers strengthen the connection between islam and terrorism which arose after september 11th and which is the most important reason for islamophobia being on the rise in the world at large and in their own countries
5385294 i think its fair to criticise the government for not fully assuming its responsibility in regards to article 20 its as if the government stopped reading at article 19 and that is a misinterpretation of current law
5385295 my decision is that there is no violation of the said rules of the danish criminal code
5385296 we must enforce the un covenant and all other conventions to which we are signatories we must accept that the conclusions are not always the way we want them to be if we want an international rule of law the un criticism helps our international reputation it hangs in tatters as it is
5385297 the government could have answered the un that we have freedom of speech in denmark and added that they regret the cartoons the prime minister defends freedom of speech but says nothing of the cartoons its an absurd deselection of the right to speak freely
5385298 let us all announce that what you call holy we call profane and then youll have to learn to live with it in a modern democracy all speech is allowed subject only to the courts and the secular laws
5385299 i dont give a hoot about religious feelings its not my concern its not the danish peoples concern
5385300 it has nothing to do with a clash of civilisations what it has to with is that we in denmark are allowed to criticise religions as we are allowed to criticise politics and if i feel like being against islam then i should be permitted to be against islam and i should be permitted to criticise islam and i should be permitted to discuss anything i like about islam mission within ed indre mission fundamentalist christians scientology nordic mythology or any other religion
5385301 a senegalese sitting in an office of racial discrimination is not going to mandate that we exercise mind control
5385302 the un rapporteur has likely never been to denmark we have for several years worked seriously with integration in denmark and along comes someone like that who knows nothing of the conditions here with a very sharp critique thats not serious
5385303 this is so damning to doudou di ne and the whole un system that he ought to be fired he has no clue none at all denmark is a tolerant and friendly nation
5385304 i dont see denmark as a xenophobic or racist country and i do not recognise the picture doudou di ne paints in his report we do occasionally talk too roughly here and the government ought to have taken the meeting with the ambassadors but i dont see the muhammed cartoons as solely the responsibility of the government the arab countries and the imams from denmark are also responsible for that
5385305 but the political context in denmark was what had given birth to the cartoons

5385396 in the guise of pastoral care and religion boys and girls in queensland are being taught different and stereotypical sets of values
5385397 parents particularly in queensland tell me they are worried that chaplains who have no training in education or youth support are taking religious instruction and counselling children based on their own narrow values set

5385419 t hats why i said in the long run i think this doesnt solve the problem it kicks it down the road
5385420 as i said on this show the other night as long as fannie and freddie have now an explicit government guarantee youve got moral hazard deeply embedded in there and thats a problem
5385421 after the president said he wouldnt veto the bill he had previously opposed shares of fannie mae shot up by close to 12 percent shares of freddie mac rose by 11 percent
5385422 the bill makes it easier for both to raise unlimited capital from the government if needed
5385423 second life is also a way for us to uncover a little bit the future of virtual currencies and as a way of understanding its potential as a financial product

5385431 i dont see the linden dollar as a fiction or as a license the linden dollar is 100 fake as the us dollar is

5385436 you come to the end of yourself trying to figure out the whys and all you are able to do is to truly look to the lord and depend on him and probably just to go to even the next day

5385584 we understand and respect your reaction which led to the boycott of our products as a result of the irresponsible and unfortunate incident
5385585 arla is within their rights to say and think what they want they are also free to move their main offices to teheran if they feel like it there they would be free to do business in a culture with which they are apparently more attuned than the danish arla would be willing to barter their grandmother to sell their goods in countries ruled by dictators
5385586 do they need to be supported denmark needs to be supported and it is imperative that we hold onto our principles if youre willing to throw away our values no support will be forthcoming from me arla seems to think that limits on denmark are for the better
5385587 limits on what you can say about islam arla wants to limit other peoples freedom of speech in denmark to sell their goods in the middle east i have no sympathy for that my liberties are not as cheap as two litres of milk if they would rather sell their milk in the middle east i have no problem with that
5385588 i just simply cant understand that our principles are taken so lightly you know what arla couldnt run their business if they werent running on freedom i think theyre selling our liberties and our culture for their milk i have no respect for that
5385589 arla is not running our foreign ministry so they are allowed to do all the ads they like but i think it is a pityful genuflection before reactions which are entirely unreasonable in contrast to the 12 cartoons whatever happened to proportional response people have their hands cut off and homosexuals are lynched and executed in the middle of the street women are being stoned for being unfaithful to their men general oppression rules theres no freedom of speech theres no freedom of religion in the moslem countries theres nothing of that which is the foundation of our way of life in europe our good life and the way arla does business all of that appears not to matter to them and we go and apologise in the middle east for our way of being in denmark i can only say that i dont hope arla think theyre speaking for me

5385653 i dont regret printing those cartoons i was defending the prophet i was defending islam against those who wish to use the religion to create conflicts and maintain their grip on power
5385654 when i entered i bowed my head and listened the preacher warned against a terrible sinner among us against one in yemen who has dishonored our religion and our prophet he talked of how disgraceful this man was i realised that i was who he was talking about i was their sinner i dared not lift my head i covered my head with my scarf and looked down there and then i realised how bad things are if the others in the mosque had recognised me they would have killed me with their shoes if they had nothing else to do it with
5385655 they looked at me in the airports and asked do we know you from somewhere are you famous then they laughed and let me through the governments central records arent connected to the airports database in yemen
5385656 my trial will recommence on march 22 i have three children and my wife in yemen who i must return to and i have my newspaper and my fight against our fanatical leaders
5385657 you had a large story about the protests drawings and denmark with two large photographs why did the caricatures need to be shown
5385658 for two reasons the first professionalism as a journalist one should alway tell the other side of the story ask the other side and show their way reasoning that is what we blame our governments for doing
5385659 the other is religious i dont understand why moslems bought into the story that it was their prophet in those cartoons weve made them bigger and more important that way our leaders accepted the idea that those cartoons provoke our faith and our prophet those cartoons arent sacred i wont recognise the premise that it is my prophet who is depicted in those cartoons i dont get insulted by cartoons because the prophet to me is above insults
5385660 i have just heard over reuters that the government has withdrawn your license is it true that the yemen observer has been closed
5385661 i asked them if it was their prophet the danish newspaper had drawn if their prophet was insulted by such things they didnt answer but took me straight to jail
5385662 my son she said how did you become like this how did you become such a terrible blasphemer i told her thet the ministry of information had been spreading false rumors about me through their newspapers and television channels she believed me in the end
5385663 many see me as a criminal now the advertisers have stopped paying the invoices the yemen observer sends them and they wont advertise in the future
5385664 it will be hard to rebuild the editorial staff we have written of the governments corruption in our last issue we wrote of how yemens embassies abroad are so corrupted that it is fair to call it exporting corruption so when we printed the cartoons they took their chance and shut us down and destroyed our foundation
5385665 they dont speak english so they cant read the yemen observer i have asked to have the article from february 4th transled into arabic for evidence theyve denied that request they havent even seen the yemen observer
5385666 they want to continue until i cant afford my attorney anymore
5385667 i dont regret printing the cartoons i defended the prophet i defended islam against those who want to use the religion to create conflicts and maintain their grip on power islam is still a good religion it is a million times more tolerant than those who persecute others in its name
5385668 the important thing is that this is a battle it wont stop we will have to yield for the time being which lets the fanatics run loose right now we have strong hearts but empty vallets right now i dont see how and when we will resume the battle
5385669 i was nervous of his reaction i feared he would say mohammed you have destroyed my newspaper and all of ours reputation but his reaction was that i did the right thing professionally and religiously you are a good moslem mohammed he said and than i felt safe i knew i was defending the prophet against the fanatics
5385670 in yemen we are outnumbered and the fanatics have succeded in pressuring us but this is an international battle in all countries against all fanatics and there the balance of power is much more equal its an international battle for release from the bondages of extremisms and fanatics
5385671 my mother grieves deeply she has done so for weeks she is on the verge of breaking recently i was driving between sanaa and taiz my hometown i was thinking who is doing this to me who has rallied the forces that are making my mother miserable my wife nervous and my father frustrated and then i hit a stone in the wayside my car was cooked i was just sitting there by the side of the road watching the other cars drive past me and i wondered if they could tell that it was him from the television and that is why they didnt stop but then i was given a ride to the repair shop and now i am in cairo with my colleagues telling my story

5385718 this program provides an excellent opportunity to hear about the latest information coming out of ash from a medical expert
5385719 we encourage patients caregivers and healthcare providers to participate in this informative program
5385720 this report single handedly crystallizes our understanding of the significance of the meredith woman
5385721 gammas are true brand advocates who are passionate and spread the word about what they like it comes as no surprise that these gamma women make up the very core of our customer base its time for marketers to engage gammas where they are already looking for social currency talking with them versus talking at them meredith is proud to be part of that conversation
5385722 and with this group of women most certainly on the rise its becoming crucial for our clients to speak to gammas in a way that not only resonates but also engages from an agency perspective the gamma factor really hits the mark on what it takes to capitalize on this profound shift in the marketplace
5385723 when a gamma finds something she likes she doesnt keep it to herself she happily spreads the word to her network of friends and family
5385724 our readers possess powerful gamma traits and continuously share their experiences thoughts and ideas with us via email events letters reader surveys blogs and online communities this dialogue allows us to stay connected and keep our finger on the pulse of what means the most to gammas
5385725 by striving to take advantage of gammas preferred communication styles learning their language of influence and developing strategies that utilize gammas webs of connection marketers can harness the influence of gamma women and gain an early to market advantage that taps into this emerging power in the marketplace

5385727 the challenge of recruiting patients to participate in clinical trials is one of the greatest obstacles to getting new drugs approved
5385728 in fact less than 5 percent of adult cancer patients nationally participate in trials
5385729 the beauty of this partnership is that it breaks down barriers often associated with clinical trial participation
5385730 the strides made under this partnership will accelerate the process of developing and delivering new more advanced drugs for patients and will allow us to bring these needed treatments out to people in their own communities without them having to travel downtown
5385731 this partnership will enable us to address many of the serious bottlenecks that delay the development of new therapies for blood cancer patients our ultimate goal is to get new treatments to patients faster and save more lives
5385732 you can get that to work one way or the other
5385733 all this is just to say that once we step inside of a custom cfc controller to handle our framework all the beauty of the coldfusion framework is moot
5385734 once inside a cfc i cant refer to the application scope i cant refer to the session scope heck i cant even refer to the request scope assuming you are following cfc best practices so much of the beauty that is the inherent coldfusion framework is completely canceled by the fact that a cfc cannot should not know about its calling environment
5385735 i had assumed that the mvc frameworks do take advantage of the application events in the application cfc i guess my feeling is that that is like paying retail sure i get the same product but isnt it less expensive to just go to the manufacturer without paying the middle man

5385739 i deeply admire your blog as well as the work of hopsicker i also think nafeez ahmed is an important and underrated voice on 9 11 and i cant recommend his war on freedom and war on truth highly enough
5385740 reasonable people may and do disagree about the controlled demolition hypothesis for any number of reasons not the least of which is that
5385741 that said im morally certain as the philosophers say that the towers were blown up and that even if im eventually proven wrong and i might be there is every reason at present to defend the controlled demolition hypothesis heres why
5385742 molten metal in all likelihood steel was found under wtc buildings one two and seven
5385743 architect bart voorsanger attempting to account for the survival of the north towers antenna clearly confirms the view that the molten metal underneath the rubble at ground zero was steel
5385744 it was the piece that collapsed onto everything else and i think it must have fallen far enough away from the internal fires within the center of the towers that it was not melted into some unrecognizable fused mass
5385745 headed the team of architects that retrieved trade center steel
5385746 nist appears to understand that no such explanation is possible that the molten metal most probably steel is the achilles heal of the official
5385747 here we might identify the source of some of the rage being directed against you on this post
5385748 yes the painstaking contextualization of the 9 11 attacks provided by ahmed is essential and sadly under emphasized in 9 11 studies
5385749 but on the other hand it isnt fair though it might appear far more respectable in some circles to leave the matter at that especially with the multiple indications in the public record indicating the possibility make that the likelihood of controlled demolition
5385750 with the broad array of relevant data on the matter 9 11 truth appears on solid even fruitful theoretical ground with the controlled demolition hypothesis especially given the state of the aptly titled
5385751 started with their conclusions and worked backward to some leading hypotheses
5385752 the controlled demolition theory not only best explains the array of specific phenomena witnessed that day it also points up some disturbing circumstances relating to security at the towers complex prior to the attacks and to the roles played by certain agencies private state and municipal in 9 11 and the corrupt military industrial power structure more generally
5385753 kevin ryan who was fired from his job with underwriters laboratories the company that certified the steel components of the wtc observes
5385754 as ryan implies whether we like it or not an intelligible account of what brought the towers down is essential to determining the character and fate of our society
5385755 here ill quote from an essay in which i paraphrase and reflect on observations by webster tarpley
5385756 i do not imply here that i necessarily believe that the fall of the twin towers announced the advent of the
5385757 tarpley warns that 9 11 plays into radical millenarian or
5385758 to fathom what was taken from us on 9 11 recall the technological achievement represented by our shimmering towers once widely assumed whatever their aesthetic flaws to be masterpieces of engineering state of the art and revolutionary
5385759 here we may begin assessing the precise depths of our betrayal on 9 11
5385760 imagine one of the towers collapsing without the handy scapegoat of a people whose natural resources we covet and which our leaders had already divvied up
5385761 on 9 11 the twin towers massive 47 interlinked column core structure and 240 interlocking outer or
5385762 to register the wound dealt to our collective imagination on 9 11 we must appeal to archetype
5385763 joachim and boaz are central symbols of freemasonry bespeaking the resonance of the twin pillar motif at the deepest mythic strata of our cultural imagination
5385764 what the controlled demolition hypothesis confronts us with is the likelihood that on september 11th 2001 2800 people were purposely nay ritually immolated over a third of them vaporized beyond trace while of many others mere fragments were found some fleck of bone or viscera
5385765 you suggest in the previous post that morgan reynolds is a disinformation artist sent to emphasize the controlled demolition hypothesis in order to keep us barking up that tree
5385766 jeff you call yourself a pessimist and if i may i suspect youre living up to that title here
5385767 the wolf who cannot reach the grapes claims they are sour
5385768 as far as the silverstein comment its not that relevant though it sounds to me like hes talking about the building and not the firefighters as with the cd hypothesis i could be wrong
5385769 but of course i was down there on 9 11 about five blocks north of wtc 7 on the west edge of the west side highway
5385770 keep up your excellent work on your blog dont know what id do without it and no we certainly dont need to agree a coalition of the dubious can be a beautiful thing
5385771 your skepticism on the controlled demolitions issue has crossed into pessimism that we may ever arrive at the verification of cd which many of us might desire
5385772 i think this album represents me finally when i listen to absolutely everybody and shine now i sound like a baby because i was a baby
5385773 somewhere in the real world represents who i am now and i believe its still recognisable you cant change your soul but i have matured and have had life experiences that brought out these songs
5385774 i dont know men i guess i just dont know what to say anymore i dont have the time or the peace of mind to blog
5385775 the committee ably chaired by liberal senator marise payne has made a real effort to produce a comprehensive and balanced report into this complex but crucial issue rather than go for simplistic solutions or political point scoring
5385776 however while i support the wide ranging recommendations i believe housing affordability is such a pressing issue that there needs to be some stronger more immediate actions beyond what the committee proposes
5385777 i strongly support the recommendation for the governments tax review to include examination of the housing market impacts of negative gearing and the capital gains tax discounts for investors
5385778 however the capital gains tax exemption on the family home should also be examined this regressive tax break is estimated to cost a massive 20 billion dollars a year in foregone revenue whilst social housing is underfunded receiving about 5 of that total
5385779 i very much welcome the proposal for extra money to be put into public and community housing but believe that the amount needs to be greater
5385780 the first home owners grant also needs to be modified so that it applies only to those who actually need that assistance to be able to afford a house rather than going to people who will just use it to buy a slightly more expensive house
5385781 technologies offer us a way to liberate knowledge and speed its flow we would be foolhardy not to exploit it
5385782 even if youve shopped the finest fabric stores in the land and rummaged through dozens of
5385783 great plains henry calvin fabrics and rogers and goffigen which all specialize in natural fibers their linen collections in particular will amaze you ranging from tissue weights to the heaviest upholstery fabrics with soft textures you must feel see larson fabrics bart halpern fabrics and donghia for fabulously inventive contemporary fabrics bergamo for beautiful silks sheers and incredible upholstery fabrics and robert allen fabrics f schumacher scalamandre and brunschwig and fils for marvelous traditional fabrics
5385784 the downside of all this magnificence is that you can only buy from these wholesale resources through an interior designer or architect or anyone else with both a resale number and an established business plus an understanding of fabrics for the home
5385785 chronic job stress may be bad news for your heart especially if your lifestyle isnt healthy so says a 12 year study of more than 10 000 british government workers in white collar jobs the bottom line workers were 68 more likely to die of heart disease suffer a nonfatal heart attack or develop angina chest pain if they had long term job stress
5385786 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold

5385801 because of everybodys schedules everybodys different locations we want to make the best of this because we dont know when and if well get the chance to do this again
5385802 im a little rusty but we going to knock the rust off
5385803 because you know sitting in a recording studio is simple playing with these guys ive got to bring my game up i had it easy for 18 years
5385804 i dont dance quite as hard but a little smoother a little sexier its efficient
5385805 what do they call it green something you know im trying to work environmentally
5385806 we always write about the things that make us laugh the stuff that we talk about the stuff that comes out of our just everyday life on the more light side
5385807 when youre in a studio you can sometimes forget why you got into this
5385808 we didnt even know what we were playing we were just jamming it hits you almost not to sound so corny but like an epiphany im like oh my god this is why i started this ive got my axe in my hand turning my amp on and its loud

5385813 you told me that the defendants would be arrested for unlawful free speech just twenty feet from where the justices decide first amendment cases id say you were crazy
5385814 but i felt compelled as a medical professional to speak out against torture that is facilitated by medical personnel at guantanamo i have to act on my ethical principles every day if i know child abuse is occurring i am required to report it the abuses at guantanamo must also be acted upon
5385815 when our country continues to deny the rights of others it was powerful to hold the name of yasser al zahrani in my heart as i sat in a court of law yasser was a 22 year old yemeni man he was arrested at 17 and brought to guantanamo he was never charged or tried on june 10th 2006 he apparently took his own life he will never have the chance to sit in this court room and my conviction today seems a small price to pay to bring his name in court
5385816 hopefully well end torture and indefinite detention as a matter of law and then we need to work to make sure that hysteria and false facts dont sweep away the soul of the nation again
5385817 you are standing up for the soul of this nation
5385818 we came to the supreme court on january 11th with one intention to put dramatically before the court both the supreme court and the higher court of public opinion and conscience the plight of the men and boys detained at guantanamo we came to the supreme court on january 11th not to protest but to present a letter to the justices asking them to act on behalf of detainees imprisoned at guantanamo to restore their human and legal rights to give a voice to the voiceless
5385819 state that individuals have a duty to prevent crimes against humanity and that if people dont act to prevent such crimes they are actually complicit in them

5385829 many parents on low incomes simply cant afford to go to work

5385832 we want the government to increase the take home pay of parents by raising the working tax credit or by increasing the minimum wage
5385833 summer is an extremely expensive time for all parents but particularly for parents in poverty
5385834 they have to keep their children entertained with activities that cost money many are also missing out on the free meals they receive during term time seasonal grants for the poorest families of 100 per child in summer and winter to help parents cope with these expensive times of year this should be part of the 3 billion investment needed for the government to keep its promise of halving child poverty by 2010

5386134 you know i dont pay attention to john mccains ads although i do notice he doesnt seem to have anything to say very positive about himself he seems to only be talking about me you need to ask john mccain what hes for and not just what hes against

5386188 american foreign policy is now one huge big mystery simply put the administration is trying to lead the world with a feel good foreign policy
5386189 if we are going to commit american troops we must be certain the y have a clear mission an achievable goal and an exit strategy
5386190 i had doubts about the bombing campaign from the beginning i didnt think we had done enough in the diplomatic area
5386191 i cannot support a failed foreign policy history teaches us that it is often easier to make war than peace this administration is just learning that lesson right now the president began this mission with very vague objectives and lots of unanswered questions a month later these questions are still unanswered there are no clarified rules of engagement there is no timetable there is no legitimate definition of victory there is no contingency plan for mission creep there is no clear funding program there is no agenda to bolster our over extended military there is no explanation defining what vital national interests are at stake there was no strategic plan for war when the president started this thing and there still is no plan today

5386202 australia must seek allies everywhere summon all moral authority and use all its influence as a key uranium exporter to reduce the risk of nuclear war
5386203 if the prime minister is genuine he must acknowledge the direct link between nuclear proliferation and our responsibilities as uranium exporters and host of nearly half the worlds known uranium reserves

5386205 i see little discernable policy difference from the previous howard government on sales of uranium to non npt countries like india or using our uranium supply status to leverage disarmament by the usa russia britain china and france
5386206 every time we sell uranium to countries stockpiling nuclear weapons either through direct export or via a third country we undermine the commitment made in hiroshima by mr rudd
5386207 the nuclear non proliferation treaty has not stopped non signatories arming themselves with nuclear weapons and the lack of action by the nuclear weapons states is partly to blame
5386208 the nuclear weapons tests by india and pakistan in 1998 were deeply worrying considering the profound hostility between these neighbours and israels refusal to allow inspection of its nuclear facilities is destabilising the middle east

5386230 there were a lot of dire predictions by opponents of tax relief that income tax cuts would drastically shrink income tax revenues but the facts tell a different story revenues from individual income taxes continue to grow
5386231 the legislatures income tax relief program along with oklahomas strong energy and agriculture sectors have helped keep our states economy afloat while the national economy has slowed down
5386232 the growth of individual income tax revenues has been modest but theyre still growing and thats a far cry from what the doom and gloomers predicted would happen
5386233 its not factual to blame the income tax cuts for a drop in general revenue

5386246 de aanleiding van het stuk en waar niemand op ingaat was en is mijn woede kwam voort uit het feit dat ik een persoonlijke herinnering aan het menselijke drama 911 had en dat vijf jaar later 911 in de manier waarop het op totaal onsmakelijke en ongepaste wijze werd herdacht in de nederlandse media is verworden tot een absurde complottheorie

5386249 genuine concern about the democracy and human right and religious freedom and environment issue in china in general and in particular in tibets case
5386250 represents the profound desire of millions of tibetan people for basic dignity and human rights his nonviolence approach his lifelong work of seeking common ground across cultural and religious divides are an inspiration to all mankind
5386251 such rhetoric doesnt serve the cause of peaceful change and reconciliation
5386252 i urge the chinese leaders engage in talks with his holiness representatives in addressing the just grievances of the tibetan people and i urge the chinese government to release tibetan political prisoners account for tibetans who have disappeared since the protest in march and engage in meaningful dialogue in genuine autonomy for tibet
5386253 it does no service to the chinese government and certainly no service to the people of china for the united states and other democracies to pretend that the suppression of rights in china does not concern us it does will and must concern us

5386261 my sense is that the vast majority of legal academics with a view of the matter disagree with substantial portions of professor yoos analyses including a great many of his colleagues at berkeley

5386284 even though the price of oil has recently skyrocketed only a handful of other fields have been flooded with man made co2 in oklahoma in the past 25 years
5386285 these carbon credits will help make many more co2 eor projects economical in this state
5386286 hundreds of billions of tons of carbon dioxide will need to be captured and injected so we can attempt to produce all of that oklahoma oil
5386287 environmentally conscious people are trying to find a home for carbon dioxide emissions cco2 is promoting the capture compression and transportation of that man made carbon dioxide in oklahoma injecting the co2 underground to produce more oklahoma oil secures local jobs increases the tax base and helps sustain our economy otherwise that 100 200 billion dollar market will be left untapped and imported foreign oil will continue to push up prices at the pump

5386292 the iattc has failed to take action at a critical juncture for the successful management of these tuna stocks
5386293 the united states certainly does not want to see a sharp decline of yellowfin and bigeye tuna stocks in the eastern pacific similar to the depletion and looming collapse of eastern atlantic and mediterranean bluefin tuna but we fear that because the members of this commission are failing to adopt a management regime supported by the best available science we may be headed down that path in the near future
5386294 we are extremely disappointed that despite the high quality of analyses and scientific research provided by iattc scientists that indicates we must cut fishing levels some countries cannot be convinced to follow their recommendations overfishing these tuna stocks could undermine the economic livelihood for many people and reduce supplies of sustainable yellowfin and bigeye tuna

5386309 for dessert each night we turned to the slightly wanton charms of the little debbie product line particularly young debbie s oatmeal creme pies whose velvety filling so perfectly captures an imagined marriage between buttercream frosting and noxzema

5386322 save the children are doing some excellent work to help children who are living in many of the worlds poorest countries projects like this one are a powerful demonstration that we can all make a contribution the knitting challenge shows that even the smallest efforts by each of us can make a difference
5386323 i am really happy to be able to support this save the children campaign and i know that many of my parliamentary colleagues feel the same it gives everyone or at least everyone who can knit the opportunity to do their bit to help protect vulnerable babies in the developing world and perhaps even save a life in the process
5386324 its a simple act to knit one of these hats and you can feel the difference it will make to the life of one tiny baby i dont want the next generation of children in the uk to grow up in a world where babies are dying from preventable causes such as pneumonia
5386325 the hats we have received so far are a fantastic start to this campaign but we still need many more we hope that everyone who knits a hat will also fill in an action card telling gordon brown why they got involved with more hats and everyones help we can push the government to stick to the promise they and other world leaders made to cut child mortality by two thirds by 2015
5386326 new money and existing funding for that matter must go for new ideas a new product line
5386327 virginians need a commitment from the governor and legislature that a funding package will not be advanced until there is a fundamental reevaluation of vdots long range transportation plans to reflect a world of significantly higher gas prices
5386328 too many virginia families are facing economic stress because we failed to design our communities and transportation systems to offer alternatives to driving for every trip more than ever our economic competitiveness and ability to ship goods and attract workers will depend on having lower energy and infrastructure costs but virginias economy and virginias families will remain vulnerable if the state continues to subsidize scattered auto dependent development patterns
5386329 the governor is on the right track with his new sub cabinet on community investment tasked with promoting smart sustainable growth by ensuring that state funds are invested in projects that reduce suburban sprawl
5386330 but the place to start changing priorities is with the billions of dollars we spend each year on transportation
5386331 with high gas prices we must provide more transportation choices and make revitalization of existing communities mixed use transit oriented and walkable communities and transit passenger and freight rail top priorities and instead of bypass highways and super wide arterial roads we will need better local street networks that more safely accommodate pedestrians and bicyclists
5386332 the energy crisis and climate change make it more important than ever that we buy the right transportation system for the next 50 to 100 years we have a great opportunity to reconsider legacy projects and to make the fiscally prudent investments for the future that is why we consider the fundamental reevaluation of vdots program a critical prerequisite to any funding deal
5386333 trees just dont grow up here on the high plateaus of the colorado rockies everybody knows that trees need good soil and good weather and up here theres no soil and terrible weather thats why the tree is a kind of miracle

5386355 en forma muy resumida esta f bula de la mitolog a griega narra la tragedia de s sifo quien fue condenado por los dioses a perder la vista y a un castigo de por vida debe subir con las manos y la cabeza un pe asco enorme por la abrupta pendiente de una monta a cuya cumbre no ha de alcanzar jam s en otras palabras est obligado a empujar perpetuamente esa enorme piedra cuesta arriba a sabiendas de que antes de que alcance la cima sta siempre rodar hacia el valle y deber volver a empezar todo de nuevo desde el principio

5386368 why are jackals funny there is often a lot of laughter when people express the inner jackal step we have found that people experience relief through being honest in jackal and expressing what is actually already in their minds nice people normally try to avoid acknowledging that they are thinking in jackal and put in some effort not to say it out loud so it releases blocked energy to voice it and the relief and recognition brings the laughter also inner jackals are fairly universal so many participants will recognise their own suppressed thoughts as they listen to the dancers jackal there is something about naked truth and this jackal honesty that brings laughter the laughter is often tinged with a squirmy painful recognition of ones own unhelpful habits of communication some people laugh out of embarrassment they think its bad even to think in jackal and feel ashamed to admit to doing so once there is space to listen compassionately to the jackal voices suppressed energy surfaces some of the laughter may come from that energy coming alive you will often see colour come into the dancers face and other physical signs that life energy stirring and rising when a dancer is on the jackal step this is one reason why the puppets work so well in a training as the jackal puppet facilitates this rise and release of energy

5386375 it is important to understand that as a natural resource trustee noaa has the added responsibility of assessing any coastal oil or hazardous material impact and developing an appropriate restoration strategy for that area

5386381 just wanted to pick you up on your analysis on 1 outside london no sha or pct or the government have published any plans for the introduction of polyclinics of the type which you say will lead to closures 25gps etc this is hugely significant and neglected the tory figures depend on an assumption that they will whilst there is no evidence of this 2 the national plans for 150 gp led health centres are clearly additional funding indeed you can stay registered with your existing gp and choose to see someone at a health centre on the weekend a virtual clinic means that gps stay in their practices but refer patients in certain situations to each other as specialists this is not mentioned in the article and is the key reason why alan johnson can reasonably claim that as a result of the governments national plans gps wont close they are additional services not in competition with gps 3 even within london where there are plans to streamline gps into polyclinics you neglect to mention that some of these polyclinics will be virtual this is described in the original darzi london report this will be up to pcts to decide but a virtual clinic means that gps stay in their practices but refer patients in certain situations to each other as specialists this is hugely significant because it would mean no closures even from the introduction of a polyclinic from these facts you should be concluding that alan is right to claim as a result of government plans there will be no closures outside of london and that pcts are still to make decisions about changes in london and therefore it is too early to put a figure on closures
5386382 of course the bin tax should go ahead why do the people who overstuff their bins expect someone else to pay for disposing of it why do the people who overstuff their bins expect someone else to pay for disposing of it it is a clear abrogation of responsibility for their own actions and they should be made to pay a rebate for recycling or a lower tax for less rubbish generated combined with harsher penalties for those found dumping in other peoples bins or fly tipping would be a great help

5386433 in north america the cost of building all types of power plants has risen substantially in the past year
5386434 while were not seeing as big an increase as some projects the same pressures are driving up the costs of contracts from our major vendors were now in competition with developing nations such as china and india for materials and we are seeing increased labor costs to build power plants
5386435 we continue to believe in the importance of this project
5386436 when its completed this will be one of the cleanest most efficient coal fired plants in the world
5386437 in the midwest coal is plentiful and relatively low cost and finding ways to burn it cleanly is fundamental to meeting our customers demand for power
5386438 if we didnt pursue this project our primary alternative would be to rely on natural gas natural gas is more costly than coal and gas prices and supplies are volatile and unpredictable
5386439 we believe this is the best alternative for reliably meeting our customers power needs
5386440 we think that greenhouse gases will be regulated and coal gasification plants with carbon capture and sequestration technology hold tremendous promise to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and help address global climate change our goal is to make this one of the nations first demonstrations of carbon capture and sequestration at a power plant

5386457 the fact that they came and bought in chaco and on both sides of the brazilian border is very telling it is an enormously strategic point in both the narcotics and arms trades and indeed the available intelligence clearly shows that the moon sect is involved in both these enterprises
5386458 the moon sect is a mafia they seek to subvert government control and are effectively building a state within a state i believe they are hoping the local population will leave so they have unquestioned authority in the zone and are free to do whatever they want

5386491 let us exercise our responsibilities as free people but let us remember we are not enemies
5386492 dont tell him i said this but he is an impressive fellow in many ways
5386493 he has inspired a great many americans some of whom had wrongly believed that a political campaign could hold no purpose or meaning for them
5386494 barack obama never held a single senate hearing on afghanistan
5386495 he hadnt been to iraq in years he voted against funding our troops and now he made time to go to the gym but cancelled a visit with wounded troops seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras john mccain is always there for our troops mccain country first
5386496 john mccain and i disagree on policy you know we disagreed on going into the war in iraq we disagreed until recently about the need to get more troops into afghanistan
5386497 but ive never questioned that he wants to make america safer and for him to suggest that i dont for him to suggest that somehow im less concerned about the safety of my wife and daughter than he is i think was was unfortunate
5386498 i think john is treading on some very thin ground here when he impugns motives and when we start to get into youre less patriotic than me im more patriotic i admire and respect john mccain very much johns better than that

5386505 i dont think it was a message to other teams because everyone knows the team we were over the last two seasons its just a good start at a difficult time with so many injuries and without the time to have a proper pre season
5386506 as ive said to the players results at stamford bridge and places like that probably wont affect our season

5386515 wurster estimates that owners of these vehicles may pay 100 per hour for labor while owners of normal cars may only pay 70
5386516 most owners like to race their vipers on tracks and to help the vehicle better handle such an environment dodge added a front sporter that hangs low on the car and is easily damaged if it scrapes a cement parking lot block the cost to replace it is 1 800
5386517 i want to make clear we always respect the chinese people not the chinese government
5386518 im actually kind of glad that his english is not as polished because i think that the message then is more easily understood by more people
5386519 and so when he says things like good sleep and good food are the source of his strength we understand that
5386520 he brings the concepts down to a more rudimentary level
5386521 and every time i see him to be honest the public talks are almost all similar messages but the main reason we come here is to be in his presence and to feel a part of his blessing we consider him the political head and the spiritual leader

5386526 heres eleven days in columbias cultural life with not much added from any other similar sized period of the year were going to focus on the events of this week and a half publicize them heavily and in a unified fashion across the board in terms of genre were going to promote them to those interested in dance theatre jazz bluegrass classical music gospel cinema visual arts opera in a circle of cities within a 100 mile or so radius of columbia and to those in our midlands area who may not have been fully aware of just how diverse and vibrant our cultural scene is here because if they like what they see and hear well they could pick just about any other fortnight here and find the same quality and diversity and so by this kind of global promotion we hope that each and every arts enterprise in columbia will attract some new audience members for the future and will each benefit in their own way

5386530 in august last year the liberals used their senate numbers to block my efforts to refer democrat legislation on this topic to a senate committee using the excuse that the human rights amp equal opportunity commission
5386531 it would be disgraceful hypocrisy even by the coalitions double standards for them to now suggest that the governments legislation which does the same thing as the democrats bill needs to be delayed by sending it to a senate committee
5386532 while the democrats were able to use our balance of power in the senate to force the previous government to remove discrimination against same sex couples in a few areas the liberal government thwarted repeated attempts by the democrats over more than a decade to remove the many other areas of inequality
5386533 as the hreoc inquiry showed many australian families suffer major injustices and hurt because of discriminatory laws reform has been thwarted for far too long because of intransigence and stonewalling under the howard government
5386534 the many australians in same sex relationships have suffered far too much for far too long they should not have to wait any longer
5386535 theres no time limit if someone kills the cartoonist in 50 years he will still get the million dollars
5386536 we want them to spend the rest of their days like prisoners under police protection

5386538 im ready to donate my share no one is refusing to pay its an honour ill give as much as possible everything i have
5386539 all contributions will be voluntary the richer ones will naturally pay more
5386540 when the prophet was alive one day someone insulted him he ordered they should be put to death so its normal that the people behind these abominations should be killed its simple
5386541 look what we basically want to do is send a message to the rest of the world no doubt it will be difficult for someone to actually go to denmark and kill these people but we want to express our anger and to ensure this never happens again
5386542 the solution is for them to say they are sorry the cartoonists or the danish government islam says you must pardon those who repent
5386543 not been told about this reward the association has not made any official announcement

5386553 the process of putting ourselves and others into neat little compartments on the basis of any label and then making judgments about everyone on the basis of those labels is as non spiritual and dehumanizing as experience as i can imagine yet it is done all the time for example our government asks us to fill out census reports and to neatly compartmentalize ourselves racially funding is allotted on the basis of these distinctions and prejudices and judgments run rampant based on what we see with our eyes rather than feel with our hearts
5386554 to make every effort to remove the labeling process from our lives
5386555 a human being is a part of the whole called by us universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty

5386572 freedom of religion is included in the un declaration of human rights and the danish constitution this means that i am free to be a christian and my neighbor can be a moslem without this interfering with our basic rights or our recognition by society at large and our neighbor another door over is allowed to believe in absolutely nothing while remaining a co equal member of our common society freedom of religion means that if someone by words or deeds attacks my two non christian neighbors on account of their beliefs or lack thereof ill be there to defend their rights in the same manner i can count on them if things get to that
5386573 we must tooth and nail combat any initiative irregardless of its initiator and religiousity which aims to lead us astray from our road towards a better democracy and we must confront all schools of thought which question the validity of the human rights that are the basis for democracy democracy is the guarantor of freedom of religion not the other way around presently the threat is islamic fundamentalism this threat is serious and therefore this is where we will do battle not christianity versus islam but democracy and human rights versus feudalism freedom of religion against totalitarianism modernity pitted against the endarkenment and the regress that wants to subdue our liberties
5386574 all human beings form one family whose members are united by submission to god and descent from adam

5386587 it is important during time of war to have a place where number one you can take people off the battlefield and not allow them to go back to the battlefield but also exploit intelligence that they may possess guantanamo today remains the key strategic intelligence platform in the war on terror
5386588 to my knowledge the cubans have never officially asked for it back
5386589 we demand today on the world day of human rights that the president of the united states and that the us government close down the torture center in guant namo and return to our homeland the territory that they occupy illegally
5386590 i think that guantanamo has become symbolic whether we like it or not for many around the world
5386591 id like to close guantanamo no question guantanamo sends a signal to some of our friends and provides an excuse for example to say the united states is not upholding the values that theyre trying to encourage other countries to adhere to

5386723 as you decrease the level of fat you can increase the risk of neurological diseases over 25 percent of the brain is fatty tissue fats in the brain play an incredibly important role in the release and binding of neurotransmitters the chemical messengers that talk to each other a study shows that while lowering cholesterol and total fat can lower the rate of heart disease it can significantly increase the rate of suicide and depression
5386724 that is why low fat diets are not very healthy for the brain or nervous system i dont mind higher fat diets if its the right type of fats like omega 3 fats from fish oils or algae or monounsaturated fats like olive oil which are much more healthy for the brain than saturated fats from animal food which harden the brain cells very rigid it hampers informaton from being passed from one cell to the other

5386747 my paid maternity leave model is unashamedly minimalist for six and half years i have advocated a minimum standard of 14 weeks government funded leave at the minimum wage as recommended by international labour organisation maternity protection convention 183
5386748 of course i support moves towards income replacement and a longer period of paid maternity leave as well as paid paternity leave but getting some paid maternity leave urgently must be the priority
5386749 my bill allows for employer top ups but does not make these compulsory as i am well aware that many small businesses are not in a position to pay these top ups and we do not want to see a position where women of child bearing age are discriminated against by business
5386750 weve been tinkering around the edges of policy for so long baby bonuses and other makeshift policies are simply no substitute for paid parental leave and specifically paid maternity leave

5386793 we can be profoundly grateful our casualties were so low but the colossal waste of iraqi civilian lives and the destruction of their country is a tragedy
5386794 iraqis live daily with the consequences of internal unrest poverty poor infrastructure and miserable health and education services

5386804 we have demonstrated written lobbied talked signed petitions some of us have even attempted to travel to guant namo but we have failed because of the failure of the three branches of government to live up to our own american and international standards we on january 11 went to the supreme court to demand that the rule of law be maintained that these men be charged that all forms of torture stop and that the prison at guant namo bay be closed
5386805 im here today on behalf of all of the prisoners at guant namo bay who are younger than i am i may be the youngest person in this courtroom today your honor but tragically i am not younger than many of those who are imprisoned at guant namo and i came to washington d c on that day to give them a voice

5386844 i have the recording of the voice of mr maliki we even listened to the translation
5386845 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq

5386878 i want to set the record straight i was making the simple point that given our history the length of this years primary contest is nothing unusual both the executive editor of the newspaper where i made the remarks and sen kennedys son bobby kennedy jr put out statements confirming that this was the clear meaning of my remarks
5386879 i realize that any reference to that traumatic moment for our nation can be deeply painful particularly for members of the kennedy family who have been in my heart and prayers over this past week and i expressed regret right away for any pain i caused but i was deeply dismayed and disturbed that my comment would be construed in a way that flies in the face of everything i stand for and everything i am fighting for in this election

5386913 the morning after my teacher came she led me into her room and gave me a doll the little blind children at the perkins institution had sent it and laura bridgman had dressed it but i did not know this until afterward when i had played with it a little while miss sullivan slowly spelled into my hand the word d o l l i was at once interested in this finger play and tried to imitate it when i finally succeeded in making the letters correctly i was flushed with childish pleasure and pride running downstairs to my mother i held up my hand and made the letters for doll i did not know that i was spelling a word or even that words existed i was simply making my fingers go in monkey like imitation in the days that followed i learned to spell in this uncomprehending way a great many words among them pin hat cup and a few verbs like sit stand and walk but my teacher had been with me several weeks before i understood that everything has a name one day while i was playing with my new doll miss sullivan put my big rag doll into my lap also spelled d o l l and tried to make me understand that d o l l applied to both
5386914 she helped me unpack my trunk when it came and was delighted when she found the doll the little girls sent her i thought it a good opportunity to teach her her first word i spelled d o l l slowly in her hand and pointed to the doll and nodded my head which seems to be her sign for possession whenever anybody gives her anything she points to it then to herself and nods her head she looked puzzled and felt my hand and i repeated the letters she imitated them very well and pointed to the doll then i took the doll meaning to give it back to her when she had made the letters but she thought i meant to take it from her and in an instant she was in a temper and tried to seize the doll i shook my head and tried to form the letters with her fingers but she got more and more angry then i showed her the doll and spelled the word again holding the doll toward her as i held the cake she made the letters d o l and i made the other l and gave her the doll she ran downstairs with it and could not be induced to return to my room all day

5386921 communication between the states on potential public health emergencies is very important
5386922 its good that electronic reporting and alerting processes are being put in place and bolstered by the cdc and public health authorities
5386923 the majority of work going forward will be related to making states plans operational for example if the pandemic plan for the state is to close schools before 1 percent of the population becomes infected it needs to be sure it can determine when the first cases arrive into the area and that proper communication is in place to carry out the plan

5386925 first coopers own article noted that the conduct of the officials involved an attack on an admini journalists have always claimed the right to protect their sources from exposure one of the most notable cases was the ellsburg papers which led to the watergate scandal that particular story was covered by bob woodward and carl bernstein who tried to protect daniel ellsberg from disclosing how he came into possession of certain documents this scenario is common to journalists who are investigating a major piece of ethical wrongdoing in governmental affairs but the question here is when should a journalist reveal sources and under which circumstances lets look at judith miller deeply involved in the valerie plame case in this case ms miller had long been looked at with suspicion and disgust by those convinced the iraq war was an orchestrated event miller who ultimately was jailed 85 days for her refusal to disclose to special investigator patrick j fitzgerald her knowledge of the plame affair and who she had spoken to about it her employer the n y times had already aided her co defendant matthew cooper who agreed to testify before the grand jury thereby avoiding millers fate the whole scandal dubbed by some as treasongate involved the disclosure of a c i a operatives covert name and status this leak cost an intelligent and very able c i a employee of long standing to lose her job and live under constant fear for the lives of her twin toddlers and herself tragically ms plame herself was only a tool used to punish her husband former ambassador joseph wilson wilson had made enemies within the administration by his disclosure that the alleged sale of yellowcake uranium to iraq had never taken place after handing in an administrative report and understanding after a period of time that this report didnt suit the prevailing mindset he went public july 6 2003 criticizing the administrations stand in the n y times he followed this by an appearance on meet the press three days later ms plame was outed publicly in the ellsberg case there was a definite and reasonable need for woodward and bernstein to protect their source the circumstances surrounding the watergate scandal exposed definite misuse of executive powers and could have endangered ellsbergs life in the second case valerie plame wasnt involved in anything germane to the leak other than her being married to joseph wilson the leaking of the information concerning n s a use of wiretaps in covert ops against foreign nationals within the u s is another example of invoking journalistic privilege the n y times sat on this story for one year allegedly at the behest of president bush which is in many reasonable minds pure nonsense as of this point in time the n y times has not offered any other source for their information are the above mentioned cases examples of when a representative of the media has gone too far in protecting sources i believe they are special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald wrote in response to n y times chairman arthur sulzberger jr in part

5386936 other countries have seen peak oil coming and have used taxes to fund decent public transport and encourage a shift to more sustainable efficient vehicles
5386937 politics have driven cuts in excise for years but further tinkering with the gst will make little difference to the bottom line for motorists by the time the legislation is passed any reduction will have been overtaken by higher oil costs
5386938 a history of appeasing the oil industry has left australia with infinitisimal use of natural gas and other alternative fuels and a fleet of cars that are huge fuel wasters
5386939 it would be far better to insist that the states spend on public transport the 3 billion they receive in gst on petrol than to keep chasing the tail of rising costs
5386940 its also time to back plug in electric vehicles which even when run on coal fired power are far cheaper to run and less greenhouse intensive than petrol and the government should match any cut to the petrol gst with a cut in the gst on public transport

5387042 reducing emissions is important but it will not reduce vulnerability to disasters sarewitz adds
5387043 we know how to prepare for disasters but the world has not made this a high enough priority sarewitz says if disaster preparation received the same political attention as global warming significant progress could be made
5387044 it is absurd to suggest that reducing greenhouse gas emissions is an important part of the answer sarewitz says
5387045 most tools needed to reduce disaster vulnerability already exist such as risk assessment techniques better building codes and code enforcement land use standards and emergency preparedness plans both researchers say
5387046 this will not happen until the issues of climate change and disaster vulnerability are clearly separated in the eyes of the media the public environmental activists scientists and policymakers sarewitz says

5387082 the rudd government has put a positive gloss on the committees concluding observations but has failed to address some of the committees core concerns
5387083 while the committee praised the governments apology to the stolen generations and the dismantling of the pacific solution it was far more critical of the appalling rates of indigenous incarceration and deaths in custody and the governments maintenance of mandatory detention and processing of asylum seekers in excised offshore processing centres such as christmas island
5387084 the committee was also heavily critical of australias anti terrorism laws and practices
5387085 this highlights the need for australia to urgently review its anti terror laws so that the laws can be examined as to their adequacy fairness respect for human rights and adherence to australias international treaty obligations
5387086 the democrats have been calling for such an inquiry for almost a year one off inquiries such as the clarke inquiry into the haneef affair will not be a panacea to the problems inherent in australias counter terror regime

5387112 the coal power sector must not be given free emissions permits the likelihood that coal power generators would try to avoid their abatement responsibility was predicted and soundly rejected by professor garnaut
5387113 concessions for coal fired power stations would mean higher targets for all other carbon emitters and shift the burden entirely to them
5387114 until now emitting carbon has been free but the need to put a price on it is widely understood and agreed

5387129 weight loss with a low carbohydrate mediterranean or low fat diet
5387130 study tips scales in atkins diets favor low carb regimen better than low fat diet for weight and cholesterol major study shows
5387131 atkins diet is safe and far more effective than a low fat one study says
5387132 diet plans produce similar results study finds mediterranean and low carb diets work just as well as low fat ones
5387133 long term diet study suggests success is hard to come by in a tightly controlled experiment obese people lost an average of just 6 to 10 pounds over two years

5387138 the rate of adherence to a study diet was 95 4 at 1 year and 84 6 at 2 years
5387139 this trial suggests a model that might be applied more broadly in the workplace using the employer as a health coach could be an effective way to improve health the model of group intervention with the use of dietary group sessions spousal support food labels and monthly weighing in the workplace within the framework of a health promotion campaign might yield weight reduction and long term health benefits

5387144 how far can you go after the gas light in your car has gone on
5387145 there is no doubt that higher petrol prices are causing financial pain for many people but thats no reason to deceive them by suggesting governments can or should try to drop the price
5387146 major cuts in fuel excise would be economically and environmentally irresponsible
5387147 the simple fact is that carbon pricing whether through a carbon tax or a trading scheme must add to the price of fuel and energy so that it more accurately reflects its environmental costs otherwise it wont work
5387148 now is the time for governments and political leaders to be looking for ways to assist people in reducing their dependence on petrol and private motor vehicle travel not subsidising them and encouraging them to use more
5387149 instead we have federal mps furiously arguing over a few cents a litre and a queensland government which is still subsidising petrol by more than 8 cents a litre and spending billions of dollars on tunnels and other infrastructure to encourage more reliance on private car usage
5387150 if we are to have any hope of meeting the greenhouse emission targets we must start being honest now about the significant changes in lifestyle that will have to accompany it

5387194 these costs are off the charts there are better ways to address parking availability and improve access to this pedestrian oriented district
5387195 it makes no sense for the county to fuel more traffic congestion in bethesda with this high cost subsidy for parking at the same time we are cutting transit and raising fares raising questions about the priorities being set
5387196 we are urging the council to defer this vote to allow for more thorough analysis of cost effective ways to address parking demand improved access to other garages and modern real time information about space availability could be far cheaper than spending 80 000 per space directing drivers to nearby open spaces also reduces needless cruising for parking and the accompanying frustration
5387197 bethesda is becoming a vibrant urban center but its character and potential are at risk due to heavy traffic too much subsidized parking is a sure way to create needless traffic bethesdas one minute actions

5387330 having senator obama at the top of the democratic ticket in november will be a tremendous asset for democratic house candidates
5387331 the 50 state strategy has been historic just the enthusiasm that our volunteers have that our candidates have that our party is visible and active even before the campaign it pays off on so many levels for a state like kansas
5387332 we saw obamas staff at work here during the primary season they had organized on the ground back from october for the feb 5 caucuses

5387345 during our incident response review in mid 2006 we decided that our industrys standard practice for alerting customers was insufficient
5387346 we wanted a system for repairing our customers credit that went beyond the required notification letter
5387347 although we already offered a credit bureau monitoring product the sis inquiry definitely spurred us to look more broadly at the solutions in the marketplace
5387348 other vendors offered some recovery services but they were primarily educational leaving recovery and repair tasks to the customer
5387349 one goal of the fee based product was to offset the basic services costs to the bank

5387351 the resource intensive tasks were establishing pricing and incentives testing sis internally developing an advertising campaign and training our staff to up sell customers to plus
5387352 being first in our market to offer robust blanket coverage that goes beyond regulatory mandates has really helped us compete against the superregional and large national banks
5387353 this leaves out a percentage of the population that is arguably the most susceptible to fraud
5387354 its gratifying to see the relief on our customers faces when they dont have to figure out how to recover on their own
5387355 the main points that most would agree on as the consensus are
5387356 ive put those four points in rough order of certainty the last one is in brackets because whilst many would agree many others who agree with 1 3 would not at least without qualification its probably not a part of the core consensus in the way 1 3 are mostof us here on realclimate are physical scientistswe can talk sensibly about past present and future changes in climate but potential impacts on ecosystems or human society are out of our field

5387363 weve tried to help motorists with our changes to vehicle excise duty which veer towards supporting the least polluting cars and making them far cheaper but of course that has meant more being paid by the more polluting cars
5387364 the judges and the courts are free to charge and then to prosecute and then to imprison for up to four years if you carry a knife
5387365 the fact is that very few people receive the maximum sentence of four years

5387408 the prime minister told me last month at prime ministers questions that the majority of drivers will benefit from his changes to car tax it is now clear that this was simply wrong

5387416 i feel that god does not want me that god is not god and that he does not really exist people think my faith my hope and my love are overflowing and that my intimacy with god and union with his will fill my heart if only they knew heaven means nothing

5387427 three years ago south dakota was the only state without a doctoral program in mathematics or computer science
5387428 were pleased to say this is no longer the case the awarding of this degree is an affirmation of our commitment both to academic excellence and to making competitive research opportunities available to our students
5387429 this is the first ph d of this nature in south dakota so i think were all pretty excited to see our first student graduate from the program
5387430 the research opportunities are limitless when it comes to science and computing this program certainly accentuates those possibilities and its a niche that we wanted to capture with this program
5387431 i thought about it about finding a job in the industry
5387432 but after giving it careful thought when i considered that maybe a masters is not enough i realized that this kind of research was unique and beneficial to furthering my education
5387433 in the near future it will become necessary for us to strengthen the faculty profile in support of this program
5387434 the administrative support is there we offer competitive assistantships and since there were no math or computer science ph d offerings before this we feel very good about growing this program

5387442 excalibur i think weve done all we can for now
5387443 what would or should we do if in the post june 30th period a so called sovereign iraqi government asks us to leave even if we are unhappy about the security situation there
5387444 well if that scenario evolves then i think its obvious that we would have to leave because if it was an elected government of iraq and weve been asked to leave other places in the world
5387445 its time for john mccain to explain why he refuses to ask iraqs leaders to take responsibility for their own future and why he has completely changed his own stated position that he would leave iraq when the iraqis ask us to
5387446 the american people need a strategy for succeeding in iraq not just a strategy for staying and john mccains stubborn refusal to adjust to events on the ground just shows that he has no plan to end this war
5387447 mccain vote for me amp youll get it world war iii and the draft

5387457 this is great news for the american people and for the scientists who devote their lives to the study of fish populations
5387458 ending overfishing on these stocks and preventing overfishing from occurring on others is critical to maintaining and rebuilding our valuable fisheries resources and this year we took a giant step forward in this regard
5387459 no new stocks were subject to overfishing in 2007 which is very good news as well
5387460 the economic recreational and ecological stakes for sustaining these resources are incredibly high
5387461 noaa fisheries scientists constantly are learning more all the time about how to help fish populations
5387462 our agency is working hard to end overfishing by 2010 as required by the magnuson stevens act continued and new sustainable management practices such as annual catch limits are one of the tools we are using

5387510 as this technology becomes more and more prevalent we want to make the whole rfid world transparent to consumers
5387511 so people can do something about all this rfid around them and make conscious choices about whether they want to have it
5387512 i said well you know there are tools out there that are capable of imitating more than one tag or making it look theyre not there at all right
5387513 it took me a month of evenings to clone my first flexpass with basically no equipment
5387514 using my latest hardware i was able to clone a verichip which like the flexpass is an id only tag with no security with only a few hours work
5387515 whats important to realize here is that rfid is a really good tracking technology that doesnt stand up at all to a determined attacker
5387516 the entire computer security community looks at rfid as a slow motion train wreck
5387517 yes weve introduced this concept of the rfid guardian and it has dual uses
5387518 its the same with a chainsaw you can use it for good or for bad the rfid industry needs to be aware of the potential vulnerabilities so they can take action to correct them
5387519 i realized it would be better to externally regulate the access to rfid tags as opposed to having the access control mechanism on the tag itself
5387520 if you offload the authentication controls and the access control to a full fledged computer then you can bring the cost per tag down
5387521 up to now if you incorporate those in the tag then the total cost of management is much lower any time you introduce a third element like that youre increasing the complexity the system
5387522 the idea is if we can build something about the size of a little card with a compact flash interface its conceivable we could come up with a version that can be mass produced and then commercially distributed

5387637 they told me something about an xbox but i had no idea what that was i thought they were talking about some kind of black box
5387638 so i hope youll forgive me dear readers when i say that the best thing that could happen to our economy is for a dozen high profile hedge funds to collapse for investment banking to enter a long deep freeze for a major bank to fail and for the price of a typical park avenue duplex to fall by 30 percent for only then might we finally stop genuflecting before the altar of unregulated financial markets and insist that wall street serve the interest of main street rather than the other way around

5387641 no one with a brain wants ridiculous things like this on their engine
5387642 considering that the rl has never featured anything more than six cylinders underhood this would be an extremely radical departure for acura in other words dont hold your breath
5387643 the government says theres an outbreak but we cant see any of that over here well resist any attempt to kill these birds we can move high court we can create a situation like nandigram and singur for our birds
5387644 we have organised a meeting in the district of birbhum we are not satisfied with the activities of killing we want to increase the rate of killing

5387648 lions are extremely socially conservative and see the mixing o
5387649 the failure of the catholic church to credibly reform its teaching on contraception
5387650 the failure of catholics to reform their behavior to church teaching
5387651 if catholicism in the u s and worldwide presents the appearance of a hierarchical leadership which has lost credibility with much of the laity the most important cause of this is the failure to rethink its teaching on sexuality and birth control
5387652 the ban on contraception is an old one going back to the 4th century and st augustine who thought that all sex was sinful except within marriage when exercised intentionally for procreation
5387653 over 600 theologians signed a statement rejecting the encyclical many lay people simply decided that this was a teaching they did not need to follow in order to be catholic yet the vatican under pope john paul ii as well as benedict xvi has continued to insist that the teaching is unchangeable
5387654 too often those who are not christians as they observe the splintering of christian communities are understandably confused about the gospel message itself
5387655 the mean old pope says no brith control but dont listen to him follow your conscience
5387656 nor are those considered as acting against nature who in the married state use their right in the proper manner although on account of natural reasons either of time or of certain defects new life cannot be brought forth for in matrimony as well as in the use of the matrimonial rights there are also secondary ends such as mutual aid the cultivating of mutual love and the quieting of concupiscence which husband and wife are not forbidden to consider so long as they are subordinated to the primary end and so long as the intrinsic nature of the act is preserved
5387657 found blameworthy by the teaching authority of the church in its unfolding of the divine law
5387658 when he man listens to his conscience the prudent man can hear god speaking
5387659 in the formation of conscience the word of god is the light for our path 54 we must assimilate it in faith and prayer and put it into practice
5387660 ignorance of christ and his gospel bad example given by others enslavement to ones passions assertion of a mistaken notion of autonomy of conscience rejection of the churchs authority and her teaching lack of conversion and of charity these can be at the source of errors of judgment in moral conduct
5387661 every action which whether in anticipation of the conjugal act or in its accomplishment or in the development of its natural consequences proposes whether as an end or as a means to render procreation impossible
5387662 t here is nothing shameful or un catholic in praying for a less restrictive position on contraception
5387663 so long as you obey the churchs teaching as it stands today

5387673 since ancient times people have sought at least four different magic potions the love potion the fountain of youth the cure all and the athletic super pill quakery has always been willing to cater to these desires
5387674 we all tend to believe what others tell us about personal experiences

5387686 each time his holiness enters the auditorium stage at the start of the public talk and teachings and upon leaving the people have been giving his holiness standing ovation apparently as a mark of their show of respect and appreciation for his presence and wisdom shared

5387788 australia has joined the world in agreeing to a cluster bomb treaty but it seems australia has won concessions on interoperability with non signatories and an exemption for our new cluster munitions the smart 155 artillery shells
5387789 this means us supplied cluster bombs can still be dropped from australian aircraft in a conflict and we can go on acquiring so called smart cluster bombs
5387790 australia had been regarded as the bad guy by the rest of the world in these negotiations because of our demands
5387791 it has put military options ahead of the terrible consequences visited on civilian populations and ignored the legitimate pleas of medical and de mining groups

5387818 i ve waited a while before writing this because i wanted to see if the immediately uplifting effect i felt after my initial downloads would last
5387819 im happy to say that the improvements to my sense of being able to direct where my life is heading my feeling of being able to achieve what i feel i want or need to do seem to have persisted beyond the first couple of days its been about 3 4 weeks now i dont feel the same way every day of course there are times when i revert to old habits of inertia and fall back into the spiral of frustration sense of failure followed by feeling of futility but having the hypnosis downloads at hand and listening to them regularly has helped restore my sense of purpose and the belief that i will achieve what i set out to
5387820 in addition to my positive experiences with the downloads i would also like to applaud the service on this website youve been true to your no questions asked 90 day money back guarantee even after the initial request just to clarify ive downloaded about 15 files now of which ive returned 3 either because they were not what i was looking for in terms of content message or the structure of the sessions was somehow less effective than the other recordings

5387839 we should study objectively and meet with genuine practitioners of other faiths and religious to get a sense of their practice
5387840 loving kindness is compassion i mean it has universal value no need for monasteries or churches even animals appreciate kindness
5387841 everyone is very pleased they are keen to support because their father or grandfather had witnessed the independent tibet they agree with his holiness that history is history and that we must look to the future they recognise the opportunity to extend a positive encouragement to china and want to help the tibetan cause they want china to be reasonable and want to tell the truth because their parents were there when tibet was free
5387842 to pursue a robust engagement of the chinese leadership to respond positively to his holiness the dalai lama who has made every effort through his middle way approach to resolve the issue of tibet with the chinese government

5387853 to talk informally about other peoples marriages and to disparage our own talk as gossip but gossip may be the beginning of moral inquiry the low end of the platonic ladder which leads to self understanding we are desperate for information about how other people live because we want to know how to live ourselves yet we are taught to see this desire as an illegitimate form of prying
5387854 ok ill just cut down on the amount of products i buy that contain wheat and grains
5387855 is not only painless but viewed as beneficial by both sides
5387856 absolutely no indication of the complexity inherent in managing the sort of changes typically encountered during the life of even a moderately complex software project this is because most enterprise software projects rely on concurrent design
5387857 theres just no doubt in my mind under any set of rules waterboarding is torture
5387858 one of americas greatest strengths is the soft power of our value system and how we treat prisoners of war and we dont torture
5387859 and i believe unlike others in the administration that waterboarding was is and will always be torture thats a simple statement
5387860 this is too important a discussion to have based on throwing one question at somebody
5387861 i have no idea how any of the intelligence community extrapolated any information from anybody where they got it how they got it and from whom they got it but waterboarding is torture
5387862 as a former soldier i will tell you that we go to great pains and a lot of men and women who serve in the military at risk of their own lives do everything they can to minimize civilian casualties and certainly do everything they can to respect the geneva convention

5387873 how can i keep making income and sustain my business without having to work everyday
5387874 we are not i have never said that we are proposing to bring young people into wards to see patients
5387875 includes a proposal to make young offenders visit casualty wards to examine knife wounds in an attempt to shock them into mending their ways
5387876 teenagers caught with knives will be forced to tour casualty units and meet the relatives of stabbing victims under government plans to combat the glorification of weapons within gangs
5387877 include visits to hospitals to see the impact of knife wounds
5387878 offenders dragged to a amp e to see injury horror
5387879 one of those proposals is that people caught carrying knives should be taken to see people in hospital who have been stabbed or to meet the families of victims is that correct
5387880 im very keen that particularly when it comes to young people we dont have some sort of simplistic approach that says that everyone caught with a knife should be sent to prison
5387881 what evidence is there that these kinds of hospital visits worked
5387882 what were talking about here is not necessarily traipsing around a hospital ward but actually talking to the a amp e surgeons looking at the sorts of injuries that are caused
5387883 her plans to force knife offenders to confront victims face to face in hospitals
5387884 could include visits to hospitals or doctors visiting them so that they can talk to health care professionals hear about the graphic impact of knife wounds and better understand what happens when somebody is stabbed

5387890 id be very eager to publish the senator on the oped page however im not going to be able to accept this piece as currently written
5387891 it would be terrific to have an article from sen mccain that mirrors sen obamas piece to that end the article would have to articulate in concrete terms how sen mccain defines victory in iraq it would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory with troop levels timetables and measures for compelling the iraqis to cooperate
5387892 you know what an editor is someone who dont like the taste of anything until they piss in it

5387916 funding of these anti blockade tools and services in addition to the income from various service contracts comes from donations and in kind contributions in different forms from people from all walks of life many talented people work for these companies as volunteers
5387917 internet visits from china through the companies networks and services have been increasing dramatically however the chinese communist regime has been employing increasingly sophisticated technologies to filter block monitor and mislead internet users inside china it has invested a huge amount of resources and manpower to update their technology of blocking and censoring the web sites
5387918 we need to continue to enhance our network so that more users can access overseas web sites without any restrictions and roadblocks and this will eventually tear down the information censorship in totalitarian regimes like china but our extremely limited funding and resources have restricted what we can actually accomplish
5387919 ill give it pause then he grinned and said ten
5387920 and when i am president i will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts thats how we can protect our coasts and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good

5387924 she was chatting with friends she looked like she was having a good time
5387925 because i cant remember anything i go in there and i hear this and the minute i go out and i cant remember anything
5387926 well i tell you before you leave do something okay do this get two buckets and put them by the door of your cell every day at the prayer of the hours you go to the spring and you fill up one of the buckets with water and then you pour the water out but every day the same bucket you fill it up and you pour it out
5387927 why is one of them very clean and very nice and the other one is just filled with spiders and cobwebs and dust and dirt
5387928 well obviously father the clean one is the one that i filled up and poured out the water every day
5387929 the remembrance of the word of god is not done by the brain its done by the behavior
5387930 somebody else is footing the bill so we can explore develop and share our ideas freely maybe we can make the world a better place
5387931 the son of god being born to a peasant girl and fostered by a carpenter who would have thought buddha was a prince
5387932 he has told you o mortal what is good and what does the lord require of you but to do justice and to love kindness and to walk humbly with your god
5387933 work harder on yourself than you do on your career and you will succeed
5387934 the avs have had to cut payroll because the nuggets are paying the luxury tax
5387935 well we are forcing people to use pulseaudio so that bugs get found by the users
5387936 i came up with an invention that was a lot like tivo
5387937 it was more like a microsoft media center computer than anything and i founded the company free tv to market the invention i spent more on that domain than i did on my house i believed at the time that by getting one of the first tv domains i would get a lot of exposure
5387938 i thought i have to spend this much why dont i set up a program that collects domains and helps out different groups
5387939 usually if you wanted to advertise your domain youd go to google and buy some ad space my idea was to take a few thousand and buy a domain that a squatter had and give it to a good group in hopes that they would link to us i was trying to get money because im joe developer im not a millionaire
5387940 i am a microsoft developer i couldnt really break out into the open source world if i switch over to linux im going to be starting over as a php or javascript developer i couldnt just stop my job and start over in the open source world donating domains was a way of me working for open source
5387941 i think the main disagreement between ric and myself is that i believe wordpress com should be used for the nonprofit free to everyone wordpress project and he wants a hand in some sort of commercial venture on top of the work of wp volunteers
5387942 i spent a hell of a lot of money on that domain and 30 000 more on lawyers
5387943 he was completely right he owned the idea of wordpress and i didnt understand that at the time i think we could have worked it out better
5387944 i thought i was doing something good with matt all my advisors starting saying hey this is great so in the midst of that we bought drupal com
5387945 they want to piggy back on the great reputation of drupal to get their link on high traffic high page rank sites
5387946 and they want to do it under the guise of open what is so open about cybersquatting a domain then benevolently allowing the people who are busy making the domain valuable to use it
5387947 when i talked to dries buytaert drupals creator and original project leader he was originally like ok what are you trying to do ok youre contributing in a different way but youre still contributing
5387948 its been a couple of years now if he thinks it dilutes his mark thats up to him and i have to take a step back and believe that for drupal hes doing the right thing but remember my whole training for 30 years is microsoft so its very hard for me to look back and say i gave you this domain it cost me and its still not used its frustrating because i could have put ads on it and taken the money and donated that over a period of time
5387949 the opendomain org web site only gave vague information and their goal was not very clear to us we thought that johnson was a domain squatter with a cover to make his actions seem generally accepted
5387950 almost instantaneously i received a reply from ric telling me he had tried to query the nameservers for fosdem org to see if they responded authoritatively for fosdem com because he wanted to point the nameserver records to us already no need to say i was really surprised by this friendly and quick action from him
5387951 his donation was a pure gift with absolutely no strings attached
5387952 everything i have seen indicated that he work with other organizations in a similar way to how we worked with us
5387953 all outbound links must be marked with the nofollow attribute
5387954 your rights to use any domain end automatically if you breach these terms in any way
5387955 says he has spent thousands of dollars registering those domains
5387956 were not going to bugfix these anymore what you see is what you get
5387957 tough enough to keep up with todays active lifestyles whether youre on the piste or paragliding
5387958 gtk world has imendio a handful of developers which cant do the task so isvs do everything for themselves in gtk world
5387959 i cant go to guademy 2009 cause the police cannot guarantee my safety
5387960 the control of qt by one entity in order to allow the ability to dual licensing is a put off for a lot of companies
5387961 the lgpl has allowed us to work with a lot of companies who have contributed back to the base platform
5387962 this is so not true i dont know where to begin
5387963 qt got it wrong by going out and producing yet another toolkit with flashy things added instead of rethinking what the platform of the future would be
5387964 if we lost control we might not be able to move in the directions we would like to go so in my opinion focusing on features would be the wrong reasons for choosing the switch
5387965 im just going to leave it at your assessment of gtk and tool kits in general is wrong in many ways but not worth arguing
5387966 if you want to debate the merits of why we need the lgpl then fine just leave the fanboying at home
5387967 yes a boring old unchanging os that does its job as only a tool is basic to the desired simplicity of what any business wants kiss keep it simple stupid

5387970 we did not do as good a job as we should have of managing some of the conversations
5387971 the tone was set by this small group of people who were loud ill mannered and obnoxious and that set a tone and a sort of mob mentality set in
5387972 by the by while im on the subject here are two quotes from seigo
5387973 the tone was set by this small group of people who were loud ill mannered and obnoxious
5387974 most free software developers want to add and enhance features
5387975 kde 4 problems highlight shift from community users to consumers
5387976 kde and open source is not ever obligated to please users that criticize instead of compromise we are not obligated to fix bugs we are not obligated to implement things that you users that criticize instead of compromise demand we are not obligated to provide open forums for you users that criticize instead of compromise to attack us personally
5387977 kde 4 is the most recent evolution of kde it comes with many new kde technologies but is less mature than the other desktops
5387978 we dont care we dont have to were the developers
5387979 because running kde3 and 4 together is not supported upstream
5387980 the shift in the foss user base started happening years ago and it is absolutely necessary that it continues if foss is to survive
5387981 normal users are nice but are not nearly so important then developers and testers
5387982 unquestionably the foss community has failed to reach the general public and too many of its members have grown complacent and smug through talking only to themselves by encouraging a debate on these subjects fioretti is providing a long needed corrective
5387983 users misunderstand users are afraid of change users are too fussy users are too demanding
5387984 the quickness and thoroughness with which kde 4 was rejected
5387985 but the metatopic of the largo it guys rant about printing isnt really printing

5388260 a critic for this paper once declared the wire the greatest dramatic series ever produced for television and as the fourth season gets under way sunday night theres no reason to quibble with that assessment
5388261 the best show of the last twenty years it is just fucking brilliant
5388262 when television history is written little else will rival the wire a series of such extraordinary depth and ambition one of the most demanding and thought provoking series ever to grace television
5388263 the wire is not just the best thing on tv its a homeric epic of modern america
5388264 the wire is a dazzling three ring circus of interwoven plot threads and its take on americas drug war makes miami vice look like a saturday morning cartoon it has made the final jump from great tv to classic tv put it right up there with the prisoner and the first three seasons of the sopranos its the sort of dramatic cycle people will still be writing and thinking about 25 years from now the wire is a staggering achievement
5388265 the smartest deepest and most resonant drama on tv the best series on tv period
5388266 certainly the wire was the best show on the air during its five seasons and can stand shoulder to shoulder with some of the greatest achievements in series television
5388267 a series routinely hailed as one of the best shows ever on television if not the best never even garnered a dramatic series nod shameful
5388268 not a single nomination for the wire in any category not one i mean seriously cancel the telecast go home and hang your freaking heads in shame
5388269 if you have only one hour a week for television give it to
5388270 the wire is as complex a picaresque as one is likely to find this side of dickens
5388271 a vibrant masterful work of art hbos novelistic urban saga the wire is the best show on television
5388272 i dont give a expletive if we ever win one of their little trinkets
5388273 i dont care if they ever figure out were here in baltimore secretly we all know we get more ink for being shut out so at this point we wanna be shut out we wanna go down in flames together holding hands all the way
5388274 let me indict hollywood as much as i can on this one
5388275 we have more working black actors in key roles than pretty much all the other shows on the air and yet you still hear people claim they cant find good african american actors thats why race neutral shows and movies turn out lily white
5388276 the wire might be the most authentic epic ever on television cable that cant be touched
5388277 some of the most compelling provocative drama ever produced for television
5388278 the emmys will in no way validate the quality of the material we put out there we take a little pride in not being nominated
5388279 the new york chapter of the national academy of television arts and sciences ny natas conducts activities that cultivate promote and encourage understanding of appreciation for and public interest in the arts crafts and sciences of television as a professional organization serving the new york area we endeavor to educate and act as a resource to our members and the industry we award the emmy for talent and ability in composition creation and performance of works which strive to improve the quality of television we recognize outstanding achievement we encourage the pursuit of excellence and promote the highest standards of quality in professional technical and personal achievement in the arts and sciences of television by conferring the industrys classic and most coveted peer recognition symbol of distinction the emmy
5388280 brilliant scathing sprawling the wire has turned our indifference to urban decay into a tv achievement of the highest order
5388281 if there ever was a series that makes hbo a necessity the wire is it
5388282 the intent of the peabody awards is to recognize the most outstanding achievements in electronic media including radio television and cable

5388294 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
5388295 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
5388296 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil

5388353 new money and existing funding for that matter must go for new ideas a new product line
5388354 virginians need a commitment from the governor and legislature that a funding package will not be advanced until there is a fundamental reevaluation of vdots long range transportation plans to reflect a world of significantly higher gas prices
5388355 too many virginia families are facing economic stress because we failed to design our communities and transportation systems to offer alternatives to driving for every trip more than ever our economic competitiveness and ability to ship goods and attract workers will depend on having lower energy and infrastructure costs but virginias economy and virginias families will remain vulnerable if the state continues to subsidize scattered auto dependent development patterns
5388356 the governor is on the right track with his new sub cabinet on community investment tasked with promoting smart sustainable growth by ensuring that state funds are invested in projects that reduce suburban sprawl
5388357 but the place to start changing priorities is with the billions of dollars we spend each year on transportation
5388358 with high gas prices we must provide more transportation choices and make revitalization of existing communities mixed use transit oriented and walkable communities and transit passenger and freight rail top priorities and instead of bypass highways and super wide arterial roads we will need better local street networks that more safely accommodate pedestrians and bicyclists
5388359 the energy crisis and climate change make it more important than ever that we buy the right transportation system for the next 50 to 100 years we have a great opportunity to reconsider legacy projects and to make the fiscally prudent investments for the future that is why we consider the fundamental reevaluation of vdots program a critical prerequisite to any funding deal

5388383 well look if thats the criteria by which we are making decisions on the deployment of u s forces then by that argument you would have 300 000 troops in the congo right now where millions have been slaughtered as a consequence of ethnic strife which we havent done
5388384 we would be deploying unilaterally and occupying the sudan which we havent done those of us who care about darfur dont think it would be a good idea
5388385 i just want to suggest that this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny
5388386 number one whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a child a 9 month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place
5388387 i mean it it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute for that purpose i think it would probably be found unconstitutional
5388388 but it opens up the market for them and they are in a position where they can expand their offerings

5388428 actually as far as social economy goes im a marxist
5388429 i am more red than the chinese leaders who seem to be only concerned with money in marxist theory there is a concern with the equal distribution of wealth so this has a moral principle which capitalist theory doesnt

5388435 so i want to carry out investigations i say to the chinese please allow the international community the international media to go to tibet and i say to the international community and media please go there and see whats happening
5388436 but then in april may 2006 the chinese intensified their accusations against me as a splittist and political repression in nunneries and monasteries in tibet increased
5388437 yes we very much want democracy tibetan autonomy must come within the framework of the chinese constitution in the early 1950s our agreement with the chinese government was very much in the spirit of one country two systems if that was carried out the crisis of 1959 when the chinese militarily invaded tibet would never have occurred but after the mid 50s chinese policy became more leftist
5388438 two thirds of lhasa is now han chinese most shops are han chinese i met some tibetan students from eastern tibet a few years ago who could speak no tibetan they had asked the chinese authorities to be instructed in tibetan and were told tibetan was of no use
5388439 more suppression is only the seed for more crisis in the future as has happened over the last 50 years the young people involved in the recent demonstrations didnt witness the atrocities of the 50s but it goes on from generation to generation
5388440 i met seven chinese students and while i explained my views two listened very carefully and at the end they smiled and were very calm and friendly but the other five had too much emotion there was no desire to listen luckily there was a long table between us or otherwise they would have taken physical action

5388508 the currents of anarchist thought that interest me there are many have their roots i think in the enlightenment and classical liberalism and even trace back in interesting ways to the scientific revolution of the 17th century including aspects that are often considered reactionary like cartesian rationalism theres literature on the topic historian of ideas harry bracken for one ive written about it too wont try to recapitulate here except to say that i tend to agree with the important anarchosyndicalist writer and activist rudolf rocker that classical liberal ideas were wrecked on the shoals of industrial capitalism never to recover im referring to rocker in the 1930s decades later he thought differently the ideas have been reinvented continually in my opinion because they reflect real human needs and perceptions the spanish civil war is perhaps the most important case though we should recall that the anarchist revolution that swept over a good part of spain in 1936 taking various forms was not a spontaneous upsurge but had been prepared in many decades of education organization struggle defeat and sometimes victories it was very significant sufficiently so as to call down the wrath of every major power system stalinism fascism western liberalism most intellectual currents and their doctrinal institutions all combined to condemn and destroy the anarchist revolution as they did a sign of its significance in my opinion

5388534 nasa took its flight crews through hundreds of simulations to ensure that their conclusions were actionable the results were staggering the survival rate for the first group was around 20 whereas the second group survived
5388535 by involving others in the process the commander of the second team did two important things 1 he placed the onus of survival on the entire crew rather than just himself and 2 he exposed himself to a greater breadth of ideas and solutions than he could have come up with all by himself

5388682 is it a far stretch to think that it has more to do with gangster rap than the legacy of slavery and discrimination
5388683 why can no black man i ever met name the last slave in his family if they care so deeply concerned about the hardships which they endured
5388684 why do you suspect that your ancestors were trading africans and not germans or greeks

5388724 humans left the caribbean monk seal population unsustainable after overhunting them in the wild
5388725 unfortunately this lead to their demise and labels the species as the only seal to go extinct from human causes
5388726 worldwide populations of the two remaining monk seal species are declining
5388727 we hope weve learned from the extinction of caribbean monk seals and can provide stronger protection for their hawaiian and mediterranean relatives
5388728 the hawaiian monk seal is a treasure to preserve for future generations
5388729 noaas fisheries service has developed a monk seal recovery plan but we need continued support from organizations and the public if we are to have a chance at saving it from extinction time is running out

5388731 this project demonstrates that something as simple as replacing a culvert can have a dramatic effect in helping sustain our nations fisheries

5388741 the document agreed by globe was by parliamentarians from the g8 and 5 countries not governments therefore it is not binding wrote terry townshend director of policy development at globe in response to ipss e mail query on the matter
5388742 the document was intended to put pressure on g8 leaders to be more ambitious and to show them that there was support in their parliaments for more ambitious action whether they acted on that was not in globes hands continued townshend

5388760 o pen of the most high say o people of the world we have enjoined upon you fasting during a brief period and at its close have designated for you naw r z as a feast thus hath the day star of utterance shone forth above the horizon of the book as decreed by him who is the lord of the beginning and the end
5388761 these are the ordinances of god that have been set down in the books and tablets by his most exalted pen hold ye fast unto his statutes and commandments and be not of those who following their idle fancies and vain imaginings have clung to the standards fixed by their own selves and cast behind their backs the standards laid down by god abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sundown and beware lest desire deprive you of this grace that is appointed in the book
5388762 the traveller the ailing those who are with child or giving suck are not bound by the fast they have been exempted by god as a token of his grace he verily is the almighty the most generous
5388763 fasting is a symbol fasting signifies abstinence from lust physical fasting is a symbol of that abstinence and is a reminder that is just as a person abstains from physical appetites he is to abstain from self appetites and self desires but mere abstention from food has no effect on the spirit it is only a symbol a reminder otherwise it is of no importance fasting for this purpose does not mean entire abstinence from food the golden rule as to food is do not take too much or too little moderation is necessary there is a sect in india who practice extreme abstinence and gradually reduce their food until they exist on almost nothing but their intelligence suffers a man is not fit to do service for god with brain or body if he is weakened by lack of food he cannot see clearly
5388764 essentially a period of meditation and prayer of spiritual recuperation during which the believer must strive to make the necessary readjustments in his inner life and to refresh and reinvigorate the spiritual forces latent in his soul its significance and purpose are therefore fundamentally spiritual in character fasting is symbolic and a reminder of abstinence from selfish and carnal desires
5388765 o ye peoples of the world know assuredly that my commandments are the lamps of my loving providence among my servants and the keys of my mercy for my creatures thus hath it been sent down from the heaven of the will of your lord the lord of revelation were any man to taste the sweetness of the words which the lips of the all merciful have willed to utter he would though the treasures of the earth be in his possession renounce them one and all that he might vindicate the truth of even one of his commandments shining above the dayspring of his bountiful care and loving kindness

5388796 spousal use of pornography and its clinical significance for asian american women
5388797 while erotica has also been defined as literature or art intended to arouse sexual desire it is distinguished from pornography in that it is void of violence illegal portrayals e g children sexism racism and homophobia and is respectful of the human beings involved
5388798 pornography is the material sold in pornography shops for the purpose of producing sexual arousal for mostly male customers second from a critical feminist analysis pornography is a specific kind of sexual material that mediates and helps maintain the sexual subordination of women

5388807 except when the term enters debates among marxists natural is invariably used to preclude any investigation of whether or not people in other societies or in other times may have behaved differently
5388808 in this particular case the argument that pornography is natural ignores the fact that there are men who have given up their obsession with pornography and who have not died
5388809 correlation is not causation but it sure is a hint
5388810 the relationship between particularly sexually violent images in the media and subsequent aggression is much stronger statistically than the relationship between smoking and lung cancer

5388813 the love family ideology has no theory of permanence or binding obligation it is oriented to adults interests and satisfactions because it emphasizes freedom of individual choice you can pick the one you love and ditch the one you no longer love without a backward glance thats great for adults but children dont have the same freedom of choice or the same enthusiasm about moving on from a childs standpoint the love family ideology is inadequate because it offers no basis for permanence in family bonds and commitments when these bonds are lost children suffer emotionally especially in their ability to trust weve set up a failure to commit factor for the next generation
5388814 according to a growing body of social scientific evidence children in families disrupted by divorce and out of wedlock birth do worse than children in intact families on several measures of well being
5388815 contrary to popular belief many children do not bounce back after divorce or remarriage difficulties that are associated with family breakup often persist into adulthood children who grow up in single parent or stepparent families are less successful as adults particularly in the two domains of life love and work that are most essential to happiness needless to say not all children experience such negative effects however research shows that many children from disrupted families have a harder time achieving intimacy in a relationship forming a stable marriage or even holding a steady job

5388832 this crisis has reached epidemic proportions and threatens our national security better training and rigorous prosecutions are needed to make clear to soldiers and the command structure that bright red lines have been drawn
5388833 women serving in our armed forces who come forward and report a sexual assault must be protected from their alleged attackers
5388834 dods record of protecting women who report a rape and prosecute their case is shocking and unacceptable i believe the legislation that congresswoman harman and i have put forward is a critical step in helping to solve this problem
5388835 the resolution introduced today by congresswoman harman focuses on a crucial issue that must be addressed sadly the number of reported sexual assaults and rapes in the military has increased dramatically and continues to rise yet the number of cases that are not prosecuted has reached alarming levels while the military has made some attempt to investigate these cases it is not doing nearly enough
5388836 in this resolution congresswoman harman who has long been seen as a leader on issues affecting women in the military lays out concrete steps for what needs to be done we urge the house of representatives to pass it without delay
5388837 the military honor and decency act will right a bureaucratic and moral wrong
5388838 as a marine i am deeply concerned for the welfare of our troops and their mission
5388839 allowing the sale of pornography on military bases has harmed military men and women by escalating the number of violent sexual crimes feeding a base addiction eroding the family as the primary building block of society and denigrating the moral standing of our troops both here and abroad our troops should not see their honor sullied so that the moguls behind magazines like playboy and penthouse can profit the military honor and decency act will right a bureaucratic and moral wrong
5388840 if soldiers want to read that stuff they can walk down the street and buy it somewhere else
5388841 in the military we have been working to curb attitudes that are degrading to women which in no way can be accepted
5388842 we talk to a lot of abused women and in many cases it turns out that mens interest in porn is linked to the abuse

5388845 in dying to live joseph nevins and mizue aizeki have produced an important and visually moving book that adds to our knowledge of the border and its place in history nevins painstaking research documents the development of the imperial valley its industrial agriculture its divided cities and the chasms between rich and poor mexican and anglo that have marred its growth through the valley runs the border and nevins accounts of the growth of border enforcement on the u s side and the racism of its legal justifications will be a strong weapon for human rights activists mizue aizeki takes her camera and tells the story of julio cesar gallegos who died in the desert trying to make it across her images of the stacked bodies of border crossers held in refrigerator trucks and the barrenness of the ocotillo cactus on the flat hardpan are eloquent testimony to the terrible risks and human costs imposed on migrants her beautifully composed portraits of gallegos family make a direct appeal to the heart in a way that words cannot and her documentation of border protests and immigrant rights demonstrations including the rows of jugs of water put out in the desert to save lives are all compelling evidence that there is a struggle going on to halt the human rights crisis she and nevins document
5388846 joseph nevins blows the red neck cover off the right wing engineered scapegoating of
5388847 a fierce and courageous denunciation of the foul politics of immigration and the two thousand mile tragedy of the mexican border snaking its way between two worlds two nations separated at birth but forever joined at the hip starting from one mans blackened corpse the tale wends its way across the desert of racial amnesia to reveal the sources of americas reactionary and futile attempt at closure of a porous frontier deftly stitching together disparate times and places from the imperial valley to zacatecas to mexicali and back to east l a nevins and aizeki weave a memorial quilt to the hundreds of innocents in unmarked graves
5388848 dying to live is a compelling perceptive and invaluable book for our times our new apartheid as explored here is as bleak and hostile as the landscapes in which people lose their lives trying merely to survive those lives delineated here are unforgettable
5388849 invisible in life like most exploited immigrants julio cesar gallegos now judges us from the hour of his terrible death he reminds us thanks to the passionate investigations of nevins and aizeki that the eyeless corpses in the imperial valley are murder victims abandoned to heat thirst and anonymous graves by a border politics compounded of historical ignorance and contempt for human rights

5388961 this decision will have consequences on the dialogue which had brought good fruits

5388964 the theological debate over women bishops has centered over the question what would jesus do the traditionalists argued that bishops must be men as were jesus and his apostles

5388972 i thought by asking my family to do this i was simply asking them to send a strong message to salt lake city that they disagree with the idea that any church has the right to entrench clearly religious dogma into the constitution of a state or country
5388973 i was just asking them to defend my civil rights

5389243 as she mentally seems the same her mitral valve is enlarged so i need to keep an eye on her breathing her face is still paralyzed so the condition will most likely be permanent

5389272 living in a coastal state means having a plan for each and every hurricane season review or complete emergency plans now before a storm threatens
5389273 planning and preparation is the key to storm survival and recovery
5389274 the outlook is a general guide to the overall seasonal hurricane activity
5389275 it does not predict whether where or when any of these storms may hit land that is the job of the national hurricane center after a storm forms
5389276 our forecasters are ready to track any tropical cyclone from a depression to a hurricane which forms in the atlantic basin we urge coastal residents to have a hurricane plan in place before the season begins and nhc will continue to provide the best possible forecast to the public
5389277 the main factors influencing this years seasonal outlook are the continuing multi decadal signal the combination of ocean and atmospheric conditions that have spawned increased hurricane activity since 1995 and the anticipated lingering effects of la ni a
5389278 one of the expected oceanic conditions is a continuation since 1995 of warmer than normal temperatures in the eastern tropical atlantic
5389279 americans in hurricane prone states must get serious and be prepared government even with the federal tribal state and local governments working perfectly in sync is not the entire answer everyone is part of the emergency management process
5389280 we must continue to develop a culture of preparedness in america in which every american takes personal responsibility for his or her own emergency preparedness

5389289 a reader was surprised negatively is how i read it that i just couldnt do hospital births any longer as a doula she says that this is when women need support the most well when you stand by and watch abuse happen it feels like you are condoning it again it goes back to the idea that somehow a doula can protect a woman or prevent all this from happening we cannot they cannot sometimes we can influence a womans choices and decisions but even then we have to be careful not to create a bias which is really really hard i think the more professional doulas weave themselves delicately through an almost impossible web of medicalized birth for me i was no good to anyone at a hospital birth if the things done stirred up feelings of disgust victimization or even plain abuse and rape of women believe me it is much better that a doula move away when she feels like this empowerment like advocacy must come from within we cannot empower anyone usually when women advocate for themselves and use their own voice they are empowered sometimes empowerment for women comes more from what we dont do rather than what we do

5389323 currently suitable donors can only be found for 20 to 30 percent of patients who might be cured by allogeneic transplants
5389324 but by learning which genes control graft rejection and gvhd new targeted treatments might be used to make transplants successful and safe for more patients
5389325 if we can identify approaches to inhibit ship in patients then we could potentially reduce the risk of gvhd in matched transplants that are currently used to treat blood cancer patients perform allogeneic transplants even when a matched donor cannot be found and increase the number of donor immune cells that can be given to patients post transplant to combat cancer relapse
5389326 with these actions we continue to build on our strategy of deploying our assets to best grow our ratings and monetize the results

5389349 delaying the decision means postponing the environmental benefits of immediately retiring four older less efficient coal units at cliffside delaying investment of 50 million a year in energy efficiency and postponing the retirement of up to 800 megawatts of older coal units as we deliver more energy efficiency to our customers
5389350 the north carolina utilities commission issued a certificate of need for our project in march 2007 the commission also determined that it was imprudent for us to depend too much on natural gas to meet our customers growing demand for power

5389378 i kind of knew misty so i sang that for him he taught me about putting the song in my own key and had me sing it again it must have been decent because at the end he looked at me and said honey youre a singer youve got soul that was probably the moment i became a serious singer i stopped taking piano lessons and took up voice lessons instead
5389379 i sang i get a kick out of you for him but instead of leaving the space for the band i just went from one phrase to the next to save time dizzy complimented my voice joked around about taking me on the road and stuff then he said you know you got a lot going on you could really do this but im gonna give you some advice now when you sing the words even if the band isnt there you still gotta leave the space for them and hear the band in your head that advice stays with me and works to this day

5389388 we are happy to see opera open an office in czech republic

5389392 even to us donors as donors turned to ever more baroque methods of aid allocation either out of fear of doing or appearing to do the wrong thing
5389393 some countries enjoy the attention of the international community while others find it harder to attract funding
5389394 which undermine national autonomy lead to distortion in aid allocations and have a poor record in improving economic performance

5389465 without question the nbc television network will lead american television ratings for the 17 straight nights it broadcasts the games
5389466 the unity they represent nationalism inherently provides a team in which all people can root
5389467 displease a substantial segment of america no matter what his decision would be i personally believe that the more one can do to shine a light on social ills the better
5389468 but that has not changed the widely held perception that winning an olympic medal is the highest athletic achievement
5389469 its fair to say that some americans will follow the games with intensity
5389470 says something about the natural tendency to root for the home team

5389479 there isnt time for a fight and there is no reason why anyone should have political opposition to him
5389480 i wouldnt consider him dugan to be a controversial candidate so it wouldnt surprise me if he got through
5389481 does it matter that each of the senators is encouraging dugans nomination sure
5389482 whether that translates to a full vote in front of the senate is hard to predict
5389483 with both democratic senators supporting him it may be barack obama would defer to the wishes of the senators

5389549 while erotica has also been defined as literature or art intended to arouse sexual desire it is distinguished from pornography in that it is void of violence illegal portrayals e g children sexism racism and homophobia and is respectful of the human beings involved
5389550 pornography is the material sold in pornography shops for the purpose of producing sexual arousal for mostly male customers second from a critical feminist analysis pornography is a specific kind of sexual material that mediates and helps maintain the sexual subordination of women

5389559 except when the term enters debates among marxists natural is invariably used to preclude any investigation of whether or not people in other societies or in other times may have behaved differently

5389565 the love family ideology has no theory of permanence or binding obligation it is oriented to adults interests and satisfactions because it emphasizes freedom of individual choice you can pick the one you love and ditch the one you no longer love without a backward glance thats great for adults but children dont have the same freedom of choice or the same enthusiasm about moving on from a childs standpoint the love family ideology is inadequate because it offers no basis for permanence in family bonds and commitments when these bonds are lost children suffer emotionally especially in their ability to trust weve set up a failure to commit factor for the next generation
5389566 according to a growing body of social scientific evidence children in families disrupted by divorce and out of wedlock birth do worse than children in intact families on several measures of well being
5389567 contrary to popular belief many children do not bounce back after divorce or remarriage difficulties that are associated with family breakup often persist into adulthood children who grow up in single parent or stepparent families are less successful as adults particularly in the two domains of life love and work that are most essential to happiness needless to say not all children experience such negative effects however research shows that many children from disrupted families have a harder time achieving intimacy in a relationship forming a stable marriage or even holding a steady job

5389586 when we were having sex hed call me his porn star and i thought that was hot
5389587 he was a lot more innocent when he was younger
5389588 he was looking for love and companionship now he just wants a good lay im sure hes looking for some huge breasted tight assed bitch
5389589 i think it will be really rare and hopefully it will happen that i can meet a guy who will be happy with only me
5389590 in couples research we know that couples even couples who fight a lot as long as theres a lot of good in the relationship about five times more good than bad they actually do pretty well
5389591 less than 10 of the videos showed any kind of a positive act and that included kissing caressing happened maybe twice something like a verbal compliment gosh you look pretty not slut bitch come over here that happened maybe five times in the 304 scenes so we have a ratio of positive to negative behaviors of 1 to 9 which is not a sustainable happy relationship
5389592 analysis of womens letters posted online revealed two themes regarding pornography consumption and its impact on sexual desire first many of the women believed they were no longer sexually attractive to their partners and this was the reason why sexual relations had diminished secondly in relationships where sexual relations had continued despite the partners pornography use women believed they were viewed more as sexual objects than real people in the relationship

5389597 now what does pornography do what pornography does most importantly is it puts lots of little scenarios in mens heads so that wherever you are you can activate that particular sexual scenario
5389598 every interaction between a woman and a man in pornography and between women and women mind you is sexual as in when youve got a nanny cause you can fuck the nanny you can fuck the secretary website secretaryporn you can fuck the maid website maid bangers you can fuck the nurse website nurse hardcore you can fuck the teacher website teacher galleries or the student website naughty book worms making the grade

5389601 pornography in the home is insidious girls pick up the message they act it out they dont know why they feel suicidal and crazy
5389602 typically a woman will say that her boyfriend is into very violent forms of pornography and likes to act out specific aspects of that and she doesnt know how to stop it
5389603 or a battered woman might perceive a connection between the pornography in her household and the bouts of violence
5389604 in no other case of media communications are people so quick to discount the argument about the human cost which i think reflects how low protection of women ranks in our priorities were quicker to protest media material that depicts the mistreatment of animals than of women

5389617 i think the democratic party which has been in many parts of the country traditionally the party which catholics have supported has been extremely insensitive to the churchs position on the gospel of life in particular and on other moral issues
5389618 i think that at times it borders on scandal as far as im concerned
5389619 however when i challenge people about this they say well bishop were not supporting abortion rights
5389620 i think theres a need for people to very actively dissociate themselves from those unacceptable positions and i think if they did that then the party would have to change
5389621 my plea with democratic leaders is always that they make space for prolife politicians and i have many prolife democrats come to me and say that theyre not making space for them i think that that is a very serious problem particularly in a state like massachusetts where it is so heavily democrat
5389622 the direct and intentional destruction of innocent human life is always wrong and is not just one issue among many
5389623 in the past there was always the fear that we were considering sort of the smorgasbord of issues but without any prioritizing or giving the impression that all issues are of equal value and i think the emphasis on trying to help people form conscience is very very important
5389624 the church is not trying to impose catholic doctrine on the world but we are trying to invite our people to take seriously their obligation to vote in a way that respects the moral law the natural law and takes into account the common good care for the poor and particularly the gospel of life which is always the center of catholic social teaching
5389625 no party and too few candidates fully share the churchs comprehensive commitment to the life and dignity of every human being from conception to natural death
5389626 a candidates position on a single issue that involves an intrinsic evil such as support for legal abortion or the promotion of racism may legitimately lead a voter to disqualify a candidate from receiving support
5389627 these estimates are encouraging because they are consistent with what we would expect to see if these stocks are recovering now that reported fishery mortality has been dramatically reduced
5389628 however we have to be careful not to jump to final conclusions we need to resolve the uncertainties around these estimates before we can definitively say these stocks are recovering
5389629 we expected to see these populations begin their recovery years ago because fishermen have been so successful at reducing dolphin deaths
5389630 the new data are the first to indicate the beginning of a recovery but these initial indications are not enough to be confident that the populations will continue to grow

5389634 focus like a laser on independents to have any shot at winning
5389635 there just arent enough republicans out there to carry this thing nationally for us
5389636 without independents it will be almost impossible for either candidate to win
5389637 they are the least likely to pay attention to politics least likely to be engaged in the political process
5389638 i cant help but feel that obama has to have accepted some of incorporated some of reverend wrights rhetoric
5389639 at the heart of all of this is the fact that the obama campaign has been hearing one set of voters who are overwhelmingly positive and telling you we believe with the independent voters there is a sense of disbelief and skepticism and an uncertainty about who he is and what he would be like as president
5389640 i keep looking at mccain and i fear well its four more years you know and i think with any republican in there i would feel the same way i definitely would like to see change
5389641 the big problem for mccain and the republicans right now is that independent voters look like democrats now from the war to the economy they answer the questions now almost the same way as democrats do thats the value of the democratic nomination for president
5389642 democrats make a mistake if they think that because theyve done this whole primary thing that the electorate as a whole has tuned into all of this they really just started
5389643 a few things have popped through one of which is the whole reverend wright issue about who obama is

5389671 yes you need the right kind of light what do you know about the taj mahal
5389672 ive heard of it i didnt believe it its for the tourists
5389673 a travelers letters he told how shah jahan would have built a black taj for himself but he was overthrown and his son abandoned the project
5389674 there never was a black taj theyve checked no foundation no black marble lying around
5389675 i found it in a manuscript by a sufi poet of the era though he wrote hindu poems as well a wise poet and thus little known
5389676 that shah jahan had promised mumtaz mahal two tombs one for each of them he was desperate to build the second but the first had taken so long and been so expensive and his son would not promise to finish the second he agonized sleepless nights pacing the hall he threw tantrums finally he decided that what he needed was a consultant
5389677 a consultant someone from outside someone who could speed things up get things does he interviewed many wise men roving worthies indian mystics europeans with blueprints but the one he chose came from china a chinese sorcerer he for one did not only promise to build it faster he promised to hide it
5389678 inside another taj mahal of course he promised that the white taj would enfold the black as sound folds silence in the poets phrase
5389679 black marble was brought to the taj by night and the sorcerers servants some of them fellow chinese who never spoke to strangers by daylight and some that were never seen by daylight at all bore the black marble through the doors of the taj when they were done when it was finished the sorcerer gave shah jahan the only way to see the black taj a black lens a dark mirror that would show the hidden tomb inside the beheld one beyond the reach of his sons greed the shah could be buried at the same time in his own tomb and buried beside his beloved in her tomb
5389680 shut up just listen this isnt an object lesson i cooked up for you
5389681 this isnt something somebody knocked together for me this is real i hocked my life savings for this and put myself so far in debt theres no way out even then i could only afford it because nobody else knows about it
5389682 just listen the sorcerer made the mirror for the black taj shah jahan used it he was satisfied so he had the sorcerer and his servants killed so nobody else would know he wanted the mirror buried beside him but that much his son could prevent after the overthrow he kept it and the poet he brought to court and showed it to found out that it doesnt just work on the taj its doesnt work on every building but it works on a lot of them the best ones the ones with souls every building that has a soul has for its soul another building which is a black taj some other building that stood in the same spot some earlier state of the building before a renovation or reconstruction or a flood or a fire or a collapse sometimes even another building altogether the one that could or should have been built but one the architect intended or another architect came up with and people didnt want or whatever just one thats better
5389683 so how how come you had to pay so much for the mirror if nobody else knew what it was
5389684 you can see the mirrors round yes and the cinnabar holds it in it goes under the edge here see now this is one piece of cinnabar and the mirrors in one piece so howd it get in there
5389685 theres some trick like ive seen it done with quarters and blocks of wood you drill a hole and stick it in and let the wood grow back over it
5389686 so you look through this and you see imaginary buildings
5389687 secret buildings and it does more than that have you ever thought about why a good god lets bad things happen
5389688 im talking about your god not somebody elses think about ants if everything were good for people but ants still had to suffer say if people stepped on them would that be wrong
5389689 so were ants something else is above us and whats above us
5389690 buildings are above us buildings are real realer than we are we make them but only like cells make us buildings are the real inhabitants of gods universe and least theyre closer to it than we are theyre real images of god the real angels and devils the real gods they rule our lives they hold us in their bellies
5389691 i want to show you the truth i want you to understand your calling your place you are not a shelterer of ants you are a creator of gods youre my best student the best student i ever had youre better than me and you could be one of the best youre good enough for the mirror ive been waiting for someone like you ever since i figured things out someone who could make the kinds of gods we need
5389692 i looked up to you i thought you were a god but youre nuts

5389702 we have already seen more than 115 tornado related deaths making this the deadliest tornado season since 1998
5389703 it is only the third time since the 1974 super tornado outbreak that there have been more than 100 tornado related deaths during a single tornado season in the u s
5389704 in 1998 and 1984 there were 132 and 122 tornado related deaths respectively 2008 will likely equal or exceed that record
5389705 the storm track over the last three months was very active across the rockies and into the east coast this active storm track lends itself to more severe weather events including tornadoes
5389706 in previous years major storms happened every week or so but we have had a major storm system affecting some part of the u s every three to four days through early spring
5389707 another contributing factor is this years early start to the season a total of 87 tornadoes struck the tennessee valley and midwest over a 24 hour period starting on feb 5 resulting in a total of 56 deaths
5389708 this storm ranks as number 15 in terms of the number of fatalities since 1950 february will likely turn out to be a record setting month once all the tornado reports have been verified

5389860 mom and dad built a nest on the stem of a plant that hangs from my deck that is about two feet from my kitchen window
5389861 i can watch the babies being fed they are still too small to actually sit up and look out but i can see their beaks resting on the top of the nest which is getting a bit too crowded as the babies grow
5389862 the parents tolerate me as i walk by their nest to go to my back yard but i am very careful about disturbing them
5389863 it was such a pleasant surprise when i discovered the nest attached to the canes of the tree rose next to the driveway
5389864 i was cutting roses for a mothers day bouquet and trimming off old blossoms when i came almost nose to nose with the nest
5389865 there are annas hummingbirds active all year in my yard but i had no idea that every time i got in and out of my car a nest was less than three feet from me
5389866 the nest is constructed of fine materials including very thin white petals from a flowering
5389867 i hope it was a successful nest that added to the hummer population in our area

5389870 as i was speeding up on the ramp to 280 east i noticed a pigeon walking on the pavement but could not do a thing but keep driving i heard a thump but as traffic was 50 to 65 mph i just kept driving on to 87 then home about eight miles away
5389871 i promptly forgot all about the poor bird as i was walking from the house to the garage to let one of my cats out i felt a feathery something on the side of my leg needless to say domino took off after the flapping wings
5389872 so i put domino inside not a happy cat and went back out and saw this beautiful pigeon behind the washing machine in the garage it seemed to be ok but a bit disoriented i found a little stick and opened the side door and sort of moved the bird outside
5389873 he wandered around a bit and then walked toward the back yard i could not see anything wrong but so far he did not fly
5389874 the next day he was not to be found so i can only hope he took off probably to find his way back to 280 and his home i still do not know where he was during the drive on the freeway perhaps on the grill of the car but at least there was a happy ending

5389930 expanding our business requires a continued investment in management and one of the ways to do that was to create the position
5389931 i thought she was supremely qualified and for almost the past decade shes been with us ive seen her grow each and every year
5389932 while this is a new position for me many of the duties and responsibilities are familiar perhaps just more formalized
5389933 by separating the positions it will let the lawyers do what they do best and let the administrative group do what they do best

5389955 dove si trovano adesso quante fosse ancora dovr scavare per recuperare tutti questi putridi resti
5389956 theres nothing new clever or well executed about the game if you must id wait for it to inevitably hit the bargain bin in two months time
5389957 people dont direct your anger at gamespot this is cnets meddling
5389958 gamespot consists just of the editorial news community and development teams its cnets marketing that puts the ads up cnets marketing that complained cnet is who can fire their eic editor in chief
5389959 has an ugly storyline with characters that are impossible to like
5389960 if youre a fan of shooters youre probably just going to be frustrated by a lot of the things that this game does wrong
5389961 some really neat ideas are buried deep deep in there but youre going to have to do a whole lot of digging more than youll probably want to do in order to find them
5389962 we do not terminate employees based on external pressure from advertisers
5389963 we take pride in the diversity and collective expertise of our editorial staff each individual who writes for gamespot offers a different perspective and writing style and we encourage each editor to bring his or her own experiences to bear with each new assignment
5389964 we love games so much that we hold them to a higher standard
5389965 certain good qualities but significant problems as well these games may well be worth playing but you should approach them with caution
5389966 never in gamespots history has money changed hands with regard to a review nor have we ever altered our verdict about any game due to advertiser pressure
5389967 gamespots business model is founded on the concept that if we provide our users with consistently trustworthy content then they will visit us often and in great numbers
5389968 it is this large dedicated audience that advertisers wish to speak to we have operated on these principles for years and will continue to do so
5389969 its impossible to care about anything thats going on in the story because every single character in the game is almost completely unlikeable theres no one to root for here not even in a cool anti hero sort of way youre just left with a bunch of really ugly characters that just become impossible to care about over time
5389970 the dialogs not particularly great though the voice actings not bad but really the problem is that every third word out of every characters mouth is the f word its great when properly used but here its just so done to death it just becomes a real crutch and stands out as just kind of lazy
5389971 but its not the story and the premise that are going to drive you away from kane amp lynch dead men the gameplay itself also has more than its share of flaws
5389972 a real pain that you just never use because its kind of a hassle
5389973 the squad tactics dont work very well because the ai on both sides of the game is really pretty flawed
5389974 the enemies get stuck on cars and run in circles and do all kinds of dumb stuff so thats not much fun either
5389975 a really neat idea but unfortunately that idea plays out in the context of kane amp lynch so it has most of the same problems that the story mode has

5389979 however the agreement circulated amongst the board of governors does not contain these assurances in the main text it does so only in the preamble
5389980 and the preamble does not have operative significance or legal force
5389981 the body of the text is almost identical to the language of the standard safeguards agreement the iaea signs with non nuclear weapons states called infcirc information circular 66 in the agencys jargon this will make it open to the criticism that it fails to defend indias strategic autonomy as a de facto nuclear weapons state as singh promised to do nor does it explicitly guarantee uninterrupted fuel supplies
5389982 the agreement is fatally flawed because it is part of a larger deal that allows india to keep its nuclear arsenal and make more fuel for nuclear weapons it detracts from the objectives of nuclear non proliferation and disarmament and will have a negative global impact
5389983 this pathetic safeguards agreement not only seriously undermines the non proliferation treaty but it also sends the exact wrong message to iran that international nuclear safeguards are only for show with this agreement the iaea has thrown its principles out the window and has abandoned its most important responsibilities
5389984 contains conflicting language on what india might be able to do if it resumes testing and fuel supplies are terminated
5389985 it is plain that the agreement will not fly and receive anything approaching consensual or broad based support in india
5389986 appears unlikely to win final approval in the u s congress this year
5389987 i dont think that a single person who signed this petition condones abuse in any fashion most dont agree with polygamy or the flds religion what unites us however is our demand that the constitutional rights guaranteed to each citizen of this country be preserved if there are cases of abuse we encourage you to investigate and prosecute them but we condemn any broad action that targets innocent individuals who have done nothing to merit removal interrogation and detention a fundamental maxim in our countrys legal process is the fact that all citizens are innocent until proven guilty apparently this is disregarded in your state

5389991 the aclu will continue to monitor the unfolding events and will work to ensure that texas officials act in a manner that is consistent with the important principles set forth above including making our views known to the texas courts at appropriate points in the judicial proceedings
5389992 boy i sure hope so i think that the state has assumed powers it should not have and a lawsuit is necessary and justified in pushing back and clarifying the constitutionality of their actions government does not easily relinquish power so citizens must fight back to claim personal liberty and draw the line at where government can properly and morally intervene
