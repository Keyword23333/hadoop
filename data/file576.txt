5760295 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source

5760298 lets treat all sides fairly in this discussion of abortion
5760299 we are going to discuss the issue of abortion and act like our discussion has no bearing on the reality of any of our views on abortion
5760300 the only advocacy that should go on in the classroom is the advocacy of the intellectual virtues

5760307 m s de la provincia de wardak a 45 minutos en coche de kabul est bajo el control de los talibanes
5760308 si estudiamos lo que pas durante la guerra contra los sovi ticos entre 1979 y 1989 kabul fue cercada por los muyaidines y ahora vemos que se repite lo mismo
5760309 la estrategia de asedio a kabul ha sido desarrollada desde hace mucho tiempo y ahora el gobierno es incapaz de impedirla hay tambi n numerosos ataques contra los convoyes log sticos
5760310 cuando los americanos derrocaron su r gimen los talibanes desaparecieron en la naturaleza pero debido a los bombardeos que con demasiada frecuencia causaron p rdidas civiles ellos han conseguido el favor de la poblaci n que aunque no les ayuda cierra los ojos
5760311 poco a poco as han avanzado sobre kabul utilizando los corredores a trav s de saroubi y wardak este logar sur y la kapisa norte
5760312 no pensamos que los ataques espor dicos est n coordinados o formen parte de un esfuerzo espec fico dirigido sobre la capital
5760313 ha explicado uno de sus vecinos padre de la ni a con quien el menor jugaba y que tambi n oy los disparos aunque pens que se trataba de alg n cazador
5760314 cuando o el primer disparo pens que era un cazador y fui a llamarle la atenci n pero
5760315 al acercarse vio al menor bajar corriendo y gritando por lo que llam a la polic a
5760316 me lo acaban de contar y no me lo cre a he venido hasta aqu al bar para comprobarlo pero a n no lo he asimilado
5760317 das ist f r einen lmulti v llig uninteressant aber f r uns ist es rentabel
5760318 h tte damals die preisentwicklung vorausgeahnt h tte die firma sicherlich nicht verkauft

5760320 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5760321 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5760322 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5760323 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5760324 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5760325 its like he read the first half of the great gatsby bookmarked it and forgot to read the rest
5760326 ive always pronounced the english word forte meaning strength or expertise fort but people deride me for it
5760327 but if we can get the democratic party to embrace drilling on the east coast and western gulf and sign off on nuclear energy and the recycling of spent nuclear fuel ill say thank you ill say thank you
5760328 this proposal is not the end of the debate its the beginning of the debate
5760329 can be lured by any party depending on its position
5760330 adds up to a swing vote representing up to 2 of the electorate in states like florida and pennsylvania
5760331 would have changed the result in that state and in all probability single handedly crowned the american president put another way the jewish swing vote mobilized behind a particular candidate would have given him the 2000 election
5760332 nr has learned that the mccain campaign has been calling key state gop officials around the country the last couple of days and sounding them out about the consequences of a pro choice vp pick
5760333 all universities now have to take the parent factor into account on university open days you can see more parents attending than children
5760334 there is a powerful sense of infantilism where parents cant let go
5760335 interesting the cd release has the voices of apollo silvia
5760336 its easy to take shots at parking wardens because its not a popular job
5760337 its not a case of saying someone got a ticket because they did something wrong so end of story
5760338 it just went from under us i got over to john and the children there was quite a rip running so it was difficult to stay in touch
5760339 i did hear a plane go over and i remember swearing at it badly for not seeing us
5760340 it took john a long time to get over it and the childrens mother it took her some time
5760341 i was in the air force in the second world war and our plane was shot down over france in 1944
5760342 i was a prisoner of war for 15 months so i might have been a bit more used to such things
5760343 this really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought
5760344 global warming will leave things like this in the dust
5760345 the natural oscillations here are nothing like what we would expect to see with global warming
5760346 the fourth libation belongs to hubris the fifth to shouting the sixth to revel the seventh to black eyes the eighth to summonses the ninth to bile and the tenth to madness
5760347 the real estate situation while its not going to get materially worse i dont think its going to get materially better in the near term
5760348 with the continued bad news from the financial sector some retail information that was disappointing and no sign of improvement in housing everything is bumping along the bottom
5760349 the effect of such a comment was to make him question his identity and his decision to identify himself as a gay man in a straight world
5760350 there is a world of meaning in what might seem to many like a he said she said tale of pettiness in a customer call center in hopewell nj if one had to summarize the purpose of the first wave of the lgbt rights movement in one phrase it would be to make it safe to be out this court got it
5760351 they decided it wasnt worth it to travel that far and that was in the midst of the depression
5760352 hay un n mero interminable de bares que no s lo generan suciedad sino tambi n alteraci n de ruido
5760353 los bares a veces no tienen la culpa porque muchos cumplen la normativa pero la gente que se concentra en esta zona es la que provoca este ruido
5760354 no cumplen la normativa en cuanto a horarios de apertura y cierre porque un pub no puede funcionar como cafeter a y viceversa y eso si que se est produciendo
5760355 al igual que se ha hecho en ciudades como valencia que se dirija toda esa congesti n de bares a los extrarradios de la ciudad
5760356 podr a haber sido una oportunidad para descentralizar los bares y las zonas de ocio nocturno
5760357 llevando esta zona a otros barrios para que los vecinos tambi n sufran las consecuencias pero lo que no nos parece justo es que por ejemplo en cuanto a los conciertos que ha habido en la expo se tuviera que adelantar el horario por quejas vecinales algo justo pero a los vecinos del casco no se nos permite que cierren o que se desplacen estas zonas de ocio nocturno
5760358 los vecinos en cuanto a ruido seguimos igualmente perjudicados no por culpa de los bares sino por la gente que se genera en la calle
5760359 la declaraci n de zona saturada aprobada en el a o 2000 paraliz la apertura de nuevos locales en esa zona porque ya hab a una saturaci n de ellos con todo lo que supone ruidos limpieza a partir de ah lo que se ha hecho es entender un programa de trabajo y permitir a los propietarios que quieran colocar esa zona en valor poder abrir locales en condiciones es decir con las condiciones sanitarias y aislamientos de ruidos
5760360 ir sacando bares y acabar con la saturaci n que hay en algunas zonas
5760361 es un reconocimiento al esfuerzo que todo el mundo ha hecho para adaptarse a la nueva forma de trabajo y a la inversi n de m s de un mill n de euros que hemos realizado para lograr las mejores instalaciones
5760362 the already severe shortage of rental stock is likely to get a lot worse and that will be bad for renters
5760363 i needed to go down to the basement and just sit
5760364 families arent aware of it or they have misconceptions that it wont be good for the patient or that the patient wont want to go or the staff wont be able to handle their mother or somehow it isnt right to leave her
5760365 they often dont have the opportunity to explore these ideas
5760366 im a good daughter i can take care of her myself
5760367 i looked at my husband and i felt sorry for him i knew he needed a break and i realized that i did too much as i love my mother im married and we need to take care of each other
5760368 what kind of daughter am i leaving her for four days
5760369 i felt i was being selfish why do i need this time away from her
5760370 she used to do a word puzzle all the time
5760371 she refused to do it at home but she was doing it wonderfully there once she came home it was no to everything she went right back down they told me that was normal the primary caregiver gets the least cooperation
5760372 we also act as advocates for the person in the medical system
5760373 i could tell the entire time that she had not been bathed
5760374 we could hear her screaming as we were walking down the hall it was awful
5760375 get on the phone and say when are you going to get me
5760376 at that point im already relaxed but when it happens at the front end it takes a minute for me to readjust
5760377 one family set up a message hi mom were having a good time
5760378 ive witnessed clients say on the phone how could you do this to me i hate it here and the daughter feels guilty and yet mom is having a great time at the bingo game
5760379 rates went too far and the reserve is now trying to reverse them
5760380 they are now becoming more concerned that we might have a recession
5760381 less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5760382 we think there could be three cuts in a row
5760383 household net worth had declined by almost 5 per cent over the first half of 2008
5760384 in effect reserve bank board members believed that monetary policy had become so tight there was the risk of serious damage to the economy
5760385 and all of the numbers are based in the real world
5760386 hemos a adido nuevos contenidos que enriquecer n esta premiada aventura mientras se mantiene todo el esp ritu que ha hecho del juego todo un xito

5760388 i crave structure ive never had good habits or a formula for how to shape a day a month a life i appreciate anything that makes me focus

5760409 senator durbin owes not only the senate an apology i dont know if censure would be in order but an apology because it does a great disservice to men and women who suffered in the gulag and in pol pots killing fields dick durbin should be required to read aleksandr solzhenitsyns gulag archipelago and i think that he may have a better understanding that theres no comparison whatsoever and it does a great disservice to the majority of men and women who are serving in guantanamo who are doing the job that theyre told to do and theyre doing it in a humane fashion to tar the american servicemen and women with a brush that applies to the gulag or the killing fields is a great disservice to the men and women in the military who are serving honorably down there
5760410 even though mccain goes into a lot of detail in that story and mentions religion a few times there is mention of the cross in the sand story even though it would have fitted in well with the whole narrative this reminds me of the hillary story when she said that there was her recollection and made no mention of sniper fire
5760411 we both stood wordlessly looking at the cross until after a minute or two he rubbed it out and walked away i saw my good samaritan often after the christmas when we venerated the cross together

5760428 the group after considering its current level of operations and the current market conditions is expected to achieve satisfactory performance for the current financial year ending june 30 2009
5760429 the strength of the years performance has in turn enabled us to sustain our dividend payout levels and the group expects to be able to continue to reward long term shareholders with dividends for future years ytl corp for example has paid dividends to its shareholders consecutively for 24 years and remains committed to its dividend policy

5760520 our selection of juniper networks to replace our existing network infrastructure was driven by junipers ability to improve network performance improve reliability and decrease maintenance costs in line with our continued expansion
5760521 other switches have software that helps moderate power usage and can be enhanced with subsequent hardware purchases but the juniper switches will meet our expected voip needs right out of the box while consuming 15 30 percent less power than the competition
5760522 todays students depend on an increasingly diverse collection of networked devices as part of their campus and learning environment
5760523 junipers integration of security into their solutions from the inside out helps us balance the heavily increasing demand for network access with rigorous policies for maintaining network security
5760524 with our old un segmented network ensuring unified and secure access has proven difficult
5760525 moreover if one element of the network goes down it all goes down junipers modular architecture based upon junos software will bring us the reliability resilience and maintenance we require to scale our network in line with our growth
5760526 we are extremely excited to help ferrum college implement a juniper networks high performance network infrastructure across its campus
5760527 we designed our new ex series ethernet switches to complete our high performance network infrastructure for the enterprise and its very gratifying to see customers such as ferrum college recognize the value of the performance reliability security and scalability we can deliver

5760550 space continues to play a critical role in decision making for potential students as well as faculty as a result higher education leadership is realizing the need to invest both in refreshing existing spaces and adding new facilities on campus
5760551 but leaders in higher education are recognizing that learning spaces play an important role in helping to meet their overall objectives of attracting and retaining students and faculty and providing them the best possible experience
5760552 its more than a matter of connecting with the course content its becoming more important for the student to engage in discussions with faculty and other students inside and outside the classroom

5760566 i mean look at the coalition of the willing whos left burkina faso yeah theyre a game changer
5760567 when you start invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of its infrastructure that is isolating
5760568 but expect not to be invited to all the cool parties
5760569 this is a very clear statement that nato having come so far after the end of the collapse of the soviet union is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5760570 there will absolutely be no new line nato does not accept that there is a new line and we are not acting as if there is a new line
5760571 but if there was a new line it would probably be somewhere to the west of georgia and ukraine just saying
5760572 intensive use of chemical based fertilizers and other agro chemicals may contribute to the pollution of the environment through the leaching of nitrate to ground water
5760573 more worryingly insects pollinate a third of everything we eat most fruits and vegetables nuts seeds and forage for our livestock as we become more and more dependent on a monoculture system of growing food we become more reliant on the honeybee to do the bulk of this work trucked into an area for just a few days or weeks when a single crop is blossoming they can be moved in their hives to more fertile pastures when the orchards and fields turn into a barren wasteland

5760591 when it comes to energy consumers are much more cost conscious
5760592 control or lack of it is a highly emotional value tied to a core american value the freedom of choice and should be leveraged in messaging
5760593 egs could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
5760594 but we feel like in negotiations its best to leave all the options open we didnt want to make that 100 percent commitment to the avoided costs
5760595 its important to us to get the avoided costs concept accepted
5760596 whether its 90 percent or 80 percent or what number thats what were open to
5760597 we have been working on this internally for several months

5760610 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5760611 it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
5760612 i think it will be ok were both grown women both professionals once we were working it felt like a good fit
5760613 i know shannen probably doesnt share the feelings that i have for tori but i love tori like my sister
5760614 everybody was on pins and needles and sort of waiting to see how theyd react they started off kind of tentative but by the time we were five takes in they were giggling and seemed to be reconnecting
5760615 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
5760616 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy so basically i had a prophylactic double mastectomies
5760617 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to

5760622 the marketing of surf highway 45 is a south taranaki initiative and they are not managing the assets at all
5760623 they have got a gem but it needs a bit more polishing than what they are doing
5760624 if we have got some sort of historical access then the council should be doing whatever it can to secure that for the future once it is gone you cant get it back
5760625 im gutted absolutely gutted i was heading down for a surf and found i couldnt get down there
5760626 people from all over the world are surfing down there in the summer
5760627 less people will be going to opunake to surf now that it has taken two of the better breaks out of the equation
5760628 it just means i get to enjoy surfing there without the crowd

5760630 john hooker has served his people for decades he still has my confidence and a number of others all feel the same way
5760631 after you get done put your robe on and come to my room so we can talk
5760632 one of the challenges for me is that i left taranaki when i was 25 so while i have a lot of friends and contacts here most people under 30 or 35 probably wouldnt know who i am
5760633 i suppose that will take me to places like burger king to talk with younger voters
5760634 thats the reality of mmp it is the party that wins the party vote that gets invited to form a government so we want that party vote
5760635 i strongly believe we will have a national government after the election and it would be good to have a national mp in new plymouth i could be their champion in wellington

5760886 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
5760887 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
5760888 four years ago we had a large failure and we blamed ourselves
5760889 i would never trade one of my silvers for gold
5760890 what i went through to get them is very special to me and really touched my heart
5760891 she came in with the possibility of winning a few gold medals and that hasnt happened we were running out of chances
5760892 i knew it wasnt quite my best routine but i knew it was enough for a medal but im really happy for shawn three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
5760893 thats the great ending she was a little bit disappointed after the all around but she went all the way to the end i can appreciate that

5760903 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
5760904 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
5760905 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
5760906 there are some crumbs of comfort that the weapons deployment has been botched or else more likely dissidents have been infiltrated and at the last moment the explosives undermined and therefore lives saved

5761176 we found out by the maryland environmental program that we had to replace the tanks in the ground and the expenditure was just too high for us to invest in new tanks so we decided to have a going out sale and to do that we went back to the 1970s and got the prices up and sold the gasoline as long as it lasted

5761192 im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna
5761193 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
5761194 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
5761195 i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it
5761196 her record label def jam has put out 3 albums in a time span of 2 years alot of that was orchestrated through her management rebel one it was never def jams intention to release so many albums back to back but marc jordan found loop holes and ways to make it happen a lot of the money rihanna made through her endorsements between covergirl cosmetics samsung notice that majority of rihannas videos have a cell phone in it
5761197 after the release of rihanna and teairra mari def jam had intention to drop both acts because their album sales were not successful
5761198 then came for the repackaging of her album good girl gone bad which is called good girl gone bad reloaded that entire project was funded through rihannas money take a bow was bought through her money the video was created with her money and so is her most recent video and single disturbia the label didnt even want to pay a dime for anything close to 750 000 was spent on those two songs alone and now she expects to see money in her account
5761199 all of it was spent on making her as big as she is now its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name

5761203 we never went out during the time we were training
5761204 our school is quite strict when we stay in school we cant go out on our own let alone when were at a
5761205 in one week we could only work four and a half days we had to have coffee breaks twice a day couldnt go into overtime and just a little discomfort was not allowed because of human rights
5761206 you could not criticize them either they all belong to some organizations they have all kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in one month
5761207 at one point the children had to run in four different directions when one fell others quickly followed
5761208 we had only two meals for the entire time there was almost no time to sleep even less time for toilet breaks
5761209 but we didnt feel so angry because the director was also there with us the whole time
5761210 we want low impact developments up here not the proposed medium to high density options which the council is pushing
5761211 the area in question is the last greenfield site in beachlands and we are afraid that what has happened with other developments around here will be repeated
5761212 we want to see parts of this area preserved as reserves and not just a mass of houses if development has to be done we want it in keeping with the character of the community here
5761213 during the first consultation open day proposals for residents to vote on were provided and the overwhelming majority wanted no growth but at the last open day last month the non and low growth options had vanished and only medium to high developments with a minimum of 1100 new residents were the options
5761214 the council does the so called consultation the government says it has to do but then goes and does its own thing regardless the whole process is more about speculators making a killing than the council doing what the community wants
5761215 i thought it was all over i quite literally thought she was going to kill me
5761216 i was trying to get up but i couldnt and then i saw my arm break as the hoof went through
5761217 there was no one around and i was calling out but i dont think anyone could have done anything anyway
5761218 if it had been a child or an elderly person they wouldnt have stood a chance i think generally it is safe but there are times when a cow can become on edge and thats when its dangerous
5761219 but this is an unfortunate incident and we are very sorry he has been injured
5761220 its very annoying but its part of the nature of the cows to protect their calves

5761232 this area has effectively been left for the past 30 years or even 60 years when the first power lines and sewer pipes were put through and the beaches damaged
5761233 it does not protect or enhance the coastal edge because most of the coastal edge will be the same as it is now
5761234 its more than the community this is about the gateway to auckland

5761246 this street is a good idea especially for someone of my size i can lose some weight the facilities here are professional like rubber flooring and standard hoops
5761247 i heard about this place from friends who said this is a good place for sports the facilities here are rather comprehensive and much better than those in other parks that ive seen
5761248 we are used to a parliamentary democracy at home in india its strengths and shortcomings i think well have to give the pakistani rulers some benefit of doubt in the initial stage but eventually they will have to deliver on the promise of not promoting any terrorist activity against india
5761249 if you are going to leave the decision of the kashmir resolutions to the parliaments of indian and pakistan then you would have to reconcile the conflicting voices and come to some degree of a common ground
5761250 now what that common ground will be one will have to wait and watch it may not be entirely of liking to india but well have to live with it and well have to deal with it
5761251 in terms of disaster management you have to think about the worst case scenario first for example if people are aware of this possibility they will be prepared and will help their families and they will be safe
5761252 i have nowhere to go and i dont have relatives who live somewhere else if its only flooding its still okay for me but if its a major storm im worried it might destroy the whole house
5761253 the local government has given us no official warning about the storm surge but ive seen my neighbours starting to panic some have already moved
5761254 i was blown away but it reflects well on the amount of effort ive put into it
5761255 i jumped off a jetty when i was about 11
5761256 i could see all this stuff on the bottom and next thing i was completely hooked
5761257 after that my father and i went on a dive course so he was my first dive buddy
5761258 ive tried to explain things in a way that a normal person would understand
5761259 ive tried to integrate pictures text story and the science
5761260 i had drifted away in a current and was quite some distance from shore
5761261 it gave me a real fright because i couldnt see the boat
5761262 we get subtropical fish from the north and subantarctic animals from the south so this region is really blessed
5761263 there are some places which get hammered pretty heavily by recreational fishermen and nearer auckland it feels there should be a lot more crayfish
5761264 but ive seen a lot more snapper around and generally speaking the marine populations are pretty good
5761265 one of the main purposes of goal is to raise the awareness of korean adoptees actually returning to korea within the korean society
5761266 the problem is the adoptees look like koreans because we are all born in korea but they grew up abroad but once they come back many koreans dont realise that korean adoptees are back in korea
5761267 i went for 23 years without knowing her my mother knowing what she looks like it was strange in some ways because she was absent from my life for 23 years but now that i have met her i hope to continue some sort of relationship and go from here
5761268 i know i cant make up for the 23 years that she was not in my life but we can hopefully establish a good relationship now
5761269 we would like to see some social welfare change especially by the government to provide support so that these women are able to keep their children
5761270 international adoption is not a viable option anymore in korea we think korea is economically developed enough and that the government can provide social services for its people the children and babies are part of this society

5761292 i was surprised and a little disappointed i thought that big businesses in the united states were by and large recognizing domestic partnerships like this for health care benefits
5761293 since their blue cross blue shield of alabama policy offers art benefits it is extremely troubling that honda has chosen to solely and specifically exclude same sex partners from art benefits
5761294 benefits for fertility treatment and art are limited to a lifetime maximum payment of 30 000 00
5761295 effective january 1 2008 honda manufacturing of alabama requests that blue cross and blue shield exclude domestic partners same sex partners from art benefits including diagnostic services related to fertility infertility that have a fertility or infertility diagnosis
5761296 i do have some personal experience providing infertility services for such patients i have found them to be very good patients and excellent parents i have watched these children grow up over the years and they are healthy and happy in every way they are no different than any other children
5761297 it is disappointing to see a company of this caliber and size discriminating against a certain population of patients
5761298 for one of the worlds leading automakers to discriminate and deny medical coverage for a disease based on someones personal orientation is downright appalling

5761311 it is unbelievable how life is so unpredictable and finds a way to distract and derail you from your plans my prayers are with jade her family in this hour when they face one of the biggest tests of their life in times ahead
5761312 i pray she comes out of this soon and stronger hope that she is going back with happy memories from this country
5761313 we are shocked to hear this unfortunate news jade has been very brave in the face of such a difficult situation and we are extending all possible support that she requires at this stage our prayers are with her
5761314 it is indeed an unfortunate development and we extend full support to jade in this testing time jade is a strong willed woman who has emerged victorious from many battles we sincerely hope that she wins this time as well
5761315 we are not sure what substance she consumed according to doctors she is out of danger but is not fit to make any statement we will register a case only after recording her version
5761316 the complaint was enquired into by the complaint committee constituted as per the guidelines laid down by the supreme court in this regard an external lady officer was also co opted as per these guidelines the officer however withdrew her complaint
5761317 the officer was given several opportunities to present her case but she refused to cooperate with the committee notwithstanding the committee completed the inquiry on may 19 2008 and found that her allegations could not be substantiated
5761318 we had also received a number of complaints from different officers of the organisation that range from alleged unauthorised communication and contact with media insubordination misbehaviour abuse of authority and sending of objectionable and offensive smss to senior government officers
5761319 due to these complaints of misconduct a preliminary enquiry was ordered on aug 8 2008 she was informed about initiation of the enquiry today tuesday but she indicated that she would not appear in any proceedings and warned that the department would face the consequences
5761320 for the first quarter the finance ministry has agreed to give oil bonds for 50 percent of the 48 865 crore revenue loss on fuel sales

5761323 ringtones have become such personal statements that a specially created condom ringtone seemed just the right vehicle to define its user as a sensible person
5761324 we have always had a strong interactive response oriented element in this ongoing campaign this downloadable ringtone provides yet another opportunity for our target audience to translate the message into an action point
5761325 the very act of downloading and using this ringtone would have a counter effect on the inhibitions and taboos that can be associated with condoms and it adds an element of fun and comfort to it
5761326 jo samjha wohi sikander one who understands is the winner
5761327 it is a remarkable initiative i dont think there is anything wrong with the condom ringtone because condom signifies smart and responsible behaviour a hallmark of any winner

5761409 issue 40 is the series finale and it should be on sale in november
5761410 the doors definitely left open ive been in comics long enough to never say never plus noble causes was always a soap opera at heart and soap operas never end plus well still see the nobles from time to time in my other superhero books
5761411 despite the five years later jump ahead which i hoped would prove to be a good jumping on point for new readers sales havent really picked up from where they were before the jump
5761412 but regardless of the sales i just started feeling like i didnt have much else to say about the characters ive been writing this book pretty consistently since 2001 and weve revamped and refocused it a few times i think i was just getting burned out on the characters so that coupled with the sales figures made me think it was a good time to end it a lot of the longtime fans were really skeptical about the five year jump but most of them have really come around and have told me they think the books stories have been better than ever im really flattered by that so i didnt want to tarnish it by letting the quality drop
5761413 dynamo 5 is continuing along nicely im more excited about that book than ever and weve got some amazing stories coming up
5761414 gemini is in the middle of a five issue miniseries
5761415 when gemini wraps up jon and i will be collaborating on something else weve already got the idea but we havent settled on a format regardless well take steps to make sure it isnt plagued with lateness like gemini is
5761416 and just a week or two ago i asked dynamo 5 artist mahmud asrar what he thought about the villainous blackthorne family setting up shop in dynamo 5s tower city that could be really fun think about it scrap vs dusk the battle of the goth girls
5761417 yildiray cinar the current noble causes artist and i will be developing a brand new series that will take noble causes place we havent settled on a concept or a name or anything yet but we know we want to tackle a solo character unfortunately due to the timing of things we wont really be able to begin work on developing this series until were done with noble causes otherwise it would fall behind but once noble causes is done well move full steam ahead on something new
5761418 ive still got dynamo 5 coming out each and every month and gemini is still alive and kicking my top cow pilot season book urban myths is currently in the lead in the voting process that determines which two concepts get to become series so ive got my fingers crossed that ill get to write more urban myths when this is all said and done and its not too late to vote voting goes until september 8th i believe you can vote once per day at the
5761419 issue 37 guest stars invincible and is going to be a ton of fun also on the horizon is noble causes archives volume 2 this was supposed to be out months ago but when i decided to end the series i also decided to hold back the second archives so that we could include everything through issue 40 so when its all said and done the two archives volumes will collect the entire run of noble causes start to finish this should go on sale sometime in early 2009
5761420 im represented by circle of confusion and theyre actively shopping all my comics around
5761421 not really no if sales were really strong and i was just tired of the characters then i could see passing it off to someone but with sales levels where theyre at thats not really an option
5761422 finding the talent compensating the talent growing the talent keeping the talent when they have so many other options from google to microsoft to hollywood
5761423 twenty some years ago when i got into this business if you were smart and you had a creative bent advertising agencies were where you went
5761424 your grandmother is suggesting you follow her example you can go after what you want and desire even when you dont know how or when it may happen
5761425 valuable perspectives that are meant to inform you of what you need to consider at the moment
5761426 multi sensory information we each experience intuition differently this multi sensory perception allows us to see meaning in everyday circumstances
5761427 i am grateful for your work i love you and i want to be in harmony with you
5761428 the great arises out of small things that are honored and cared for everybodys life really consists of small things greatness is a mental abstraction and a favorite fantasy of the ego the paradox is that the foundation for greatness is honoring the small things of the present moment instead of pursuing the idea of greatness the present moment is always small in the sense that it is always simple but concealed within it lies the greatest power
5761429 what the world doesnt tell you because it doesnt know is that you cannot become successful you can only be successful
5761430 also its kind of documenting all the small moments that you wouldnt really notice or remember because it all really blurs into one haze
5761431 something where things are more ambiguous or suggestive you cant really tell whats going on but you can invent your own story
5761432 i kind of struggled whether to include that one or not because its so rock n roll
5761433 we had this bus that kept breaking down and the bus broke down in the desert between vegas and either l a or outside of san diego they all had to get out and push the bus and jump on it to get it started

5761435 it seemed weird to be in these empty nowhere places every night spending a lot of time in certain places but not taking anything with you from that i just like the idea of personal impersonal spaces

5761443 energy plan to lower gas prices has become clear over the last few days
5761444 the new legislation that speaker pelosi has outlined includes crucial clean energy solutions and other important measures that will make america more energy independent offer consumers relief at the pump and will force drilling supporters to admit whether they really want to move america forward or simply want to continue helping the oil companies
5761445 plan that would finally lead to lower fuel costs its only logical that the radicals at the sierra club would praise her tactics
5761446 the house republicans unprecedented nationwide gas prices protest is now in its third full week my republican colleagues and i have vowed to continue the historic uprising in washington and in communities across the country until the house returns to session for a vote on the american energy act our all of the above plan to lower gas prices whether that means ending the protest tomorrow or next month is up to house speaker nancy pelosi california democrat while the speaker used a radio address last weekend to unveil yet another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices she remained silent about bringing congress back to washington from its summer recess to deal with the no 1 issue on the minds of the american people

5761449 the ideal place for children of different cultures to mix
5761450 sitting on their hands for ten years in regard to providing strategies for the teaching of immigrant children in our schools
5761451 i find it incredible that after 10 years of net immigration into ireland of families and children from all over the world the government is still waiting on the publication of reports and research before it decides on the best approach for teaching immigrant children in our schools
5761452 what has the department of education been doing for the past decade if it finds itself unable to provide clear guidelines on this important matter
5761453 unfortunately this is typical of this departments approach to dealing with integration strategies the national action plan against racism was initiated in 2005 and is due to expire at the end of this year as part of the plan 250 recommendations were made to government departments to promote anti racism and interculturalism
5761454 fallen significantly short of its specific commitments in regard to diversity in the classroom
5761455 the classroom is the ideal place for children from different cultures to mix we should be doing all in our power to promote integration rather than separation in this regard comments from politicians suggesting that segregation may be required are ill judged
5761456 a means should be found to provide them with tuition in english while allowing them remain in the same class as other children
5761457 recent suggestions made by deputy hayes about immigrant children are irresponsible the word segregation has very negative connotations it brings to mind images of racial segregation and a time where racism was not only condoned but was an everyday reality in many parts of the world
5761458 i would be disappointed if deputy hayes is consciously using emotive language for assumed political advantage and if he is speaking for the fine gael party in that regard
5761459 it is at least a move towards a form of indirect discrimination in education
5761460 if we follow the logic of brian hayess suggestion then all of these children should also be removed from mainstream classrooms segregating children on the basis of ability in reading and writing has been shown in research to be unsuccessful in terms of socialisation and this then will in the long term have a detrimental effect on the development of literacy skills among children

5761465 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race and its just a shame that it was on the biggest race of my life
5761466 when youre racing a car and youre going max velocity and you hit a curb you can either maintain control or crash and burn
5761467 sometimes i think we get tested to see what well do
5761468 weve definitely been under a big test as a family
5761469 i think our childhood comes into play a lot making her the person she is
5761470 everything happens for a reason and for whatever reason we had to endure a lot as children
5761471 it made us survivors no one deserves this more than her
5761472 these are tears of sadness definitely not tears of joy
5761473 they keep saying lolo youre the favorite to go in and i tell them no its hurdles 10 obstacles in front of us and anybody can hit any one of those
5761474 about the middle part of the race the hurdles were just coming up very fast
5761475 and if you cant youre not meant to be champion so today i was not meant to be champion
5761476 i had to walk away from my baby we were always together thats the first time i had to leave her
5761477 i had managed to keep us all together but she was doing so good in high school that i didnt want her to leave
5761478 she was on her way and i knew she was on her way i knew
5761479 today is hard tomorrow is going to be harder but what can you do but try again

5761483 cobra ii the inside story of he invasion and occupation of iraq
5761484 you know one of the things that the strategy talks about is the need for an expanded conception of what jointness is all about
5761485 not only the armed services but civilian capabilities within the defense department other departments and agencies and our friends and allies and its really that integration of all the elements of national power and being able to bring them to bear on the security challenges we face thats an imperative
5761486 it is equally applicable to other security challenges that we face now and will face in the future its one of the reasons why secretary gates has been such a vocal proponent of greater funding for you know the nonmilitary instruments of national security if you will particularly the state department usaid and others
5761487 do i really want to go through the hassle of moving or just stay here another year
5761488 dov il nemico in questa storia egli non appare mai se non al margine del campo una macchia che si muove alla finestra dietro la mitragliatrice unombra al di l della barricata un vecchio in un ufficio una silhouette in trincea rimane quasi sempre anonimo ma nello stesso tempo il nemico sempre presente non unillusione non unimmaginazione per chi intende non soltanto battere un avversario militare ma sovvertire la societ in cui vive una linea principale di lotta sulla quale si distinguano ben da lontano lamico e il nemico non esiste

5761504 around the globe wind generating capacity has been expanding at a rapid 30 clip in recent years
5761505 and 2008 is already shaping up to be even better
5761506 the companys most promising division is involved in the production of structural wind towers
5761507 led by states such as texas and california wind farms around the country will generate almost 50 billion kilowatt hours of electricity this year of course the u s is still playing catch up with many other regions
5761508 in fact countries such as spain portugal and denmark all rely on wind farms for as much as one quarter of their total power needs
5761509 the outlook is even brighter in many booming energy hungry asian markets in china installed wind power capacity surged 130 last year and will reportedly supply a great deal of the electricity needed for the upcoming 2008 beijing olympic games
5761510 thanks to the great strides in engineering wind turbine output has increased by a factor of ten or higher in some cases over the past decade
5761511 the power generating potential of wind is enormous the wind resources in north dakota alone are enough to power a staggering one third of the countrys total power needs
5761512 it comes as no surprise to hear that 36 billion will be spent on wind generating equipment this year i see trinity as a great way to participate
5761513 trinity is a top supplier of several different industrial product lines including railroad cars highway girders inland cargo barges and propane tanks all of which happen to be doing pretty well at the moment
5761514 however the firm has a large and growing stake in wind towers the company is among a handful of recognized leaders in the market for these giant tubes
5761515 this facet of the firms business is growing rapidly amid heated demand wind tower revenues have spiked 35 fold over the past four years soaring from just 11 million in 2004 to an expected 390 million this year
5761516 better still order backlog over the past 12 months has surged from 200 million to 1 6 billion representing a highly visible stream of future business within the next five years management is forecasting that wind tower revenues could double again to 800 million
5761517 even without energy equipment the firms other business segments alone merit a closer look
5761518 the firms fleet of 41 000 railroad cars available for lease is 99 6 utilized and the average lease has over five years remaining
5761519 these revenues are locked in and will provide some stability regardless of what happen on the product sales side but future orders should remain robust considering 700 000 of the nations 1 6 million railcars are more than 25 years old and the replacement cycle has already begun
5761520 with a balanced mix of old and new trinity reported second quarter earnings that shattered expectations and raised its full year earnings outlook sales and profits in the firms wind tower unit shot up 58 and 117 respectively with all this in mind i will add trn to my deep discount portfolio

5761524 we had many enticing ideas and it wasnt easy for our selection committee
5761525 the trend seems to be exotic fusion flavors and concepts based on ethnic foods
5761526 the tie breaker for multiple entries with the same idea was a 50 word essay which is posted along with the flavor idea
5761527 in the third book of this work c 5 we made a passing reference to this question but did not decide whether angels inasmuch as they are spirits could have bodily intercourse with women for it is written who makes his angels spirits that is he makes those who are by nature spirits his angels by appointing them to the duty of bearing his messages for the greek word which in latin appears as angelus means a messenger but whether the psalmist speaks of their bodies when he adds and his min isters a flaming fire or means that gods ministers ought to blaze with love as with a spiritual fire is doubtful however the same trustworthy scripture testifies that angels have appeared to men in such bodies as could not only be seen but also touched there is too a very general rumor which many have verified by their own experience or which trustworthy persons who have heard the experience of others corroborate that sylvans and fauns who are commonly called incubi had often made wicked assaults upon women and satisfied their lust upon them and that certain devils called duses by the gauls are constantly attempting and effecting this impurity is so generally affirmed that it were impudent to deny it from these assertions indeed i dare not determine whether there be some spirits embodied in an aerial substance for this element even when agitated by a fan is sensibly felt by the body and who are capable of lust and of mingling sensibly with women but certainly i could by no means believe that gods holy angels could at that time have so fallen nor can i think that it is of them the apostle peter said for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment 2 peter 2 4 i think he rather speaks of these who first apostatized from god along with their chief the devil who enviously deceived the first man under the form of a serpent but the same holy scripture affords the most ample testimony that even godly men have been called angels for of john it is written behold i send my messenger angel before your face who shall prepare your way mark 1 2 and the prophet malachi by a peculiar grace specially communicated to him was called an angel malachi 2 7
5761528 let us omit then the fables of those scriptures which are called apocryphal because their obscure origin was unknown to the fathers from whom the authority of the true scriptures has been transmitted to us by a most certain and well ascertained succession for though there is some truth in these apocryphal writings yet they contain so many false statements that they have no canonical authority we cannot deny that enoch the seventh from adam left some divine writings for this is asserted by the apostle jude in his canonical epistle but it is not without reason that these writings have no place in that canon of scripture which was preserved in the temple of the hebrew people by the diligence of successive priests for their antiquity brought them under suspicion and it was impossible to ascertain whether these were his genuine writings and they were not brought forward as genuine by the persons who were found to have carefully preserved the canonical books by a successive transmission so that the writings which are produced under his name and which contain these fables about the giants saying that their fathers were not men are properly judged by prudent men to be not genuine just as many writings are produced by heretics under the names both of other prophets and more recently under the names of the apostles all of which after careful examination have been set apart from canonical authority under the title of apocrypha there is therefore no doubt that according to the hebrew and christian canonical scriptures there were many giants before the deluge and that these were citizens of the earthly society of men and that the sons of god who were according to the flesh the sons of seth sunk into this community when they forsook righteousness nor need we wonder that giants should be born even from these for all of their children were not giants but there were more then than in the remaining periods since the deluge and it pleased the creator to produce them that it might thus be demonstrated that neither beauty nor yet size and strength are of much moment to the wise man whose blessedness lies in spiritual and immortal blessings in far better and more enduring gifts in the good things that are the peculiar property of the good and are not shared by good and bad alike it is this which another prophet confirms when he says these were the giants famous from the beginning that were of so great stature and so expert in war those did not the lord choose neither gave he the way of knowledge unto them but they were destroyed because they had no wisdom and perished through their own foolishness

5761531 a set of techniques and approaches which can be used to extend the limits of achievable reality our sense of achievable reality is the limitations which we believe bind us into a narrow range of actions and successes what we believe to be possible for us at any one time in this context the purpose of magic is to simultaneously explore those boundaries and attempt to push them back to widen the sphere of possible action
5761532 one of the illusions of life is that the present hour is not the critical decisive hour write it on your heart that every day is the best day of the year

5761536 there have been multiple cases of overheating and fire damage in particular during recharging so please use caution
5761537 above 35 mph there is an external combustion system which is basically a heater that uses a little bit of gasoline or biofuel or ethanol or vegetable oil that will heat the air
5761538 heating the air increases its volume and by increasing its volume it increases the cars range thats why with one gallon of gasoline or its equivalent we are able to make over 100 mpg
5761539 no ones really proven a six seater passenger car can get any better than 75 miles to the gallon so this would represent a big step forward
5761540 they would have to prove that before they can throw rocks at the prius
5761541 i dont think we should discount this advance if it happens
5761542 los gobiernos se han dado a la tarea de calificar a la sem como una ltima alternativa cuya incumbente puede ser designada sin exigir la experticia necesaria y sin consultar su compromiso con la causa de las mujeres
5761543 la persona que se designa debe responder a eso que sea una persona comprometida y que tenga experiencia pero sobre todo inter s la sem no ese un capricho de estado ni una d diva del poder a las mujeres
5761544 los acontecimientos pol ticos de los ltimos d as vinculados al inicio del nuevo per odo gubernamental ponen nueva vez en evidencia el tradicional desprecio frente al tema de la equidad de g nero que ha caracterizado las ejecutorias de este gobierno y en general de los tres partidos mayoritarios a su paso por el estado
5761545 i have observed all the local dolphins over a number of years and have watched billie occasionally performing tailwalks in the years since her release sometimes in the bow wave of large ships which is an awesome sight
5761546 about five years ago another female dolphin called wave began performing the same behaviour but does so with much greater regularity than billie a third adult female dolphin has also been seen tailwalking
5761547 irrespective of function it would seem that tail walking in the adelaide waters is another example of cultural behaviour in large brained animals by cultural behaviour we mean a behaviour that is transmitted between individuals and becomes a characteristic of a particular social group
5761548 i think ea called take two and said you can either participate or not
5761549 i think take two is going to negotiate a dollar per share higher and then claim victory a deal is going to get done
5761550 that us 25 74 was predicated on distributing their products at christmas this year
5761551 going forward we are challenged to validate that us 25 74 price
5761552 a mutual deal is going to have to be higher than us 25 74 in order for the board of take two to save face call it a dollar or two dollars more
5761553 the integration risk is that you lose the talent and ea cant afford to lose the talent
5761554 browsers plus the right downloads such as flash or silverlight will drive the consumer experience more than the os
5761555 its possible that if people approached us from other browsing companies wed be open to that and clearly what we want to do is get the technology out in the marketplace
5761556 some of what the iphone has taught us is that people will browse on phones that have the right experience level but until the market takes off there will always be questions about how many and how far the technology goes
5761557 until you have a full desktop browsing experience its not going to go very far which is why our experience is really the image of the desktop and tools to help users navigate through that on a smaller screen

5761575 es una obligaci n humanitaria y nosotros lo hemos dicho con toda claridad que de cualquier parte del mundo quien solicite un asilo a nicaragua sabe que lo tiene porque es una necesidad humanitaria

5761619 i was confident today because my bike was fast from friday practice and with jeremy we made a small modification to the front after warm up to allow me to be a bit faster in some sections and it worked very well i lost about half a second getting past hopkins at the start and casey was incredibly fast at that stage like hed already done ten laps for a short time i was worried but then after two laps i understood that my bike was working very well and that i was fast enough to try to catch him i had closed a little bit already and gradually the red bike was becoming a bit bigger in front of me and i think this is when he started to push harder and made his mistake i was anticipating a very hard battle if i did catch him so when i saw the red bike slide out i could hardly believe it this made things a lot easier for me after that i just enjoyed riding my bike my bridgestone tyres worked very well until the end and my m1 felt very good of course i cant count this as a complete victory because casey fell and i am sorry for him but this is racing and i have to be happy with this result we are 50 points clear which is a lot and i am very excited to be going to misano in this situation however we know that 50 points is still not always enough when you have someone as strong as casey and so we wont relax now we have two days of testing and we will try some new electronics in order to help me open the throttle earlier and also of course test some bridgestone tyres

5761697 u2 have an album coming out around january and then the band is going on another world tour in march and april so the boys have been told to start exercising all the summer weight off
5761698 i dont think this case necessarily lends itself to that conclusion
5761699 its not uncommon for players to try to exit a contract part way through their deal and for them to have to pay a sum of money but that case williams is high profile and unusual
5761700 ill take a stab and say that youd get two or three of these cases a year that we would deal with in those cases wed say look guys the player wants to move on and whats it going to take to make that happen
5761701 our view is that you should always try and work through these things amicably sure you can try and walk out on your contract but you run the risk of lawsuits and not everyone has the same financial backing to challenge those as toulon appear to have
5761702 theyve got a salary cap over there for a start and even without a salary cap they couldnt be paying that kind of compensation
5761703 obviously toulon seem to have that luxury of a reasonably endless supply of funds but im just judging that from the outside
5761704 i can see some players looking at this and saying i want to get out of my contract and thats a path i could try
5761705 put it this way we wouldnt be advising any player that we represent to go about things that way
5761706 it would be great i really wanted to stand again for the ioc because i really enjoy that work and i feel i can make a difference because ive had a quite a lot of experience after five olympics
5761707 i knew about a year ago that id put myself up for election again
5761708 the chances of getting elected are pretty small because youve got huge numbers from european countries and new zealands so small
5761709 were quite a small sport and sailors really arent that interested in that sort of stuff but its very big in europe and asia the chances of getting voted on are actually quite slim
5761710 we can tell athletes it is an important mechanism and they should vote but not who they should vote for we dont have an ioc member so it is important to have someone at that level

5761740 when bear stearns moved to a new building several years ago tighter security regulations killed our old stairwell mincha minyan but after a few months i was able to get the conference room next to my office word spread and we started attracting outsiders from nearby firms after a few weeks i received a call from bears human resources department i was told there were issues with outsiders coming to a secure floor
5761741 it turns out there is a law requiring companies to provide employees with reasonable accommodation to prayer so while the company did not want an official bear stearns minyan they agreed to give me a room every day for prayer for the andy neff meeting to which i could invite some of my friends to enable me to have a minyan twenty to 30 people regularly attended the service
5761742 ironically though bear stearns is gone the minyan lives on roughly one third of the attendees were from j p morgan which owned three buildings adjacent to our headquarters we simply transferred management of the minyan to j p morgan

5761750 what if i am willing to bless my world no matter what i see
5761751 the key to the success of blessing is that it acknowledges
5761752 i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing
5761753 the great blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach but we shut our eyes and like people in the dark we fall foul upon the very thing we search for without finding it
5761754 i dont know what the blessing is but i know its here somewhere
5761755 i ask my inner being and my inner being answers
5761756 we need to ask ourselves honest powerful and searching questions

5761807 this is about a publishers commitment to its author to get one of a very few pro obama books out into the marketplace in the shortest amount of time
5761808 our initial order was based on the book being available to all booksellers simultaneously an even playing field
5761809 they are not going to bully us and the book will be a huge success in spite of their boycott
5761810 i am looking forward to getting back playing in the spl
5761811 ive always enjoyed my spells in scotland and have usually done not too bad the teams ive played with have always tried to play good football and motherwell are no different
5761812 the spl is a great league with every week being a real test
5761813 europe is also massive for us as i understand it if we win one tie well be in the group stages and could play against some massive clubs so i am really looking forward to that
5761814 ive been to nine cities in nine days not the way to see america
5761815 its been pretty gruelling but im trying to treat each interview as if its the first one ive done
5761816 there were scenes where hes playing the actor in the scene with me as the director and we have to improvise
5761817 and he has to yell cut and he has to say cut as the actor and i say no youre not the director im the director so were not cutting and were still rolling and he says cut cut and i go no no were still rolling
5761818 and then i start thinking is ben stiller saying cut or is the actor saying cut in the scene and that was really confusing
5761819 im doing a live tour in the fall in england and i know the comedy in that wouldnt translate specifically because there are certain rhythms of delivery and also the way you speak with a different accent
5761820 the british quite like losers and gravitate towards people who fail honestly and americans like people who maybe have lost slightly but absolutely have to win or succeed in some way
5761821 but generally i think there are more similarities than dissimilarities
5761822 we british have far more in common in terms of comic taste with americans or people coming out of america than we do with our european cousins only 20 miles away
5761823 in terms of humour all our cultural references are often the same television and entertainment we often watch a lot of the same stuff so its not a huge stretch
5761824 mostly it was about explaining it to my parents who are god fearing simple folk
5761825 its disappointing but you have to be careful with hamstring injuries and we dont want a repeat of last season when shefki kuqi joined us and suffered a hamstring injury in his first game
5761826 you just have to prove yourself brave truthful unselfish and willing to profess your support of scientology and someday you will be a real boy
5761827 hi little person im suri im your big sister be patient daddy will be here in a moment to bring you to life
5761828 the fact of the matter is what i will have to decide over the next few weeks is whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament or whether in fact the government a government needs a new mandate
5761829 were going to have to judge how the parliamentary agenda is unfolding
5761830 i think weve had a productive two and a half years i do think that that has slowed somewhat in recent weeks but as i say i will take the next few weeks to do a thorough evaluation of the situation and ensure that one way or another we can have a productive parliament in the future
5761831 until now these animals seem to have been regarded more as background noise than as an active component of the ecosystems response to warming
5761832 our results suggest that herbivores in the arctic and elsewhere may constrain the increase in shrub growth that is projected by current models of global warming their grazing could have important consequences for the ability of shrubs to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide
5761833 careful management and conservation of existing populations of muskoxen and caribou as well as other large herbivores should be a priority in plans to mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystems
5761834 we need to be aware that the carbon dioxide sponge represented especially by shrubs and trees may not be as big as we thought it was this finding is yet another reason to think carefully about reducing carbon dioxide emissions
5761835 simply keeping a lid on 90210 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5761836 individually most politicians have a deep understanding of the plight of our health system collectively especially at the federal level they are reluctant even afraid of engaging in a meaningful public policy discussion on health
5761837 in canada we pay dearly to keep patients on waiting lists this is illogical preventing patients from getting treatment is not my definition of preventative medicine
5761838 this excluded the growing costs of waiting to see a gp or specialist and it excluded the costs as patients deteriorate and develop chronic severe irreversible damage addiction to painkillers or depression
5761839 the private public rhetoric on health care is a relic of tedious and tiresome propaganda those who relentlessly argue against and demonize the private sector need a reality check
5761840 if our governments are unable to fund the education of the number of doctors we need we must consider alternatives public private partnerships are used in such circumstances to build infrastructure including roads bridges and hospitals
5761841 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5761842 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5761843 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5761844 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5761845 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5761846 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5761847 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5761848 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5761849 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5761850 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane
5761851 were just happy to continue making the show as it is

5761862 sometimes i cry sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of healing
5761863 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy so basically i had a prophylactic double mastectomies
5761864 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one

5761869 janie starched and ironed her face and came set in the funeral behind her veil
5761870 like all the other tumbling mud balls janie had tried to show her shine
5761871 the finest thing orange county had ever seen with negro eyes
5761872 janie starched and ironed her face and came set in the funeral behind her veil

5761875 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5761876 we in canada have understood over the past several years how difficult this mission is
5761877 we of course are very proud to have the french making an enhanced contribution in afghanistan
5761878 we believe its essential for all nato countries to stay the course so that we accomplish our objectives of creating a stable environment in afghanistan that is not a threat either to its people or people elsewhere in the world
5761879 the afghan national army is saying that any time we get close to them they detonate themselves
5761880 janie sent her face to joes funeral and herself went rollicking with the springtime across the world

5761883 it was hard to love a woman that always made you feel so wishful

5761885 like all the other tumbling mud balls janie had tried to show her shine
5761886 the finest thing orange county had ever seen with negro eyes
5761887 what is an appropriate reason to read this passage given what you understand from previous chapters about janie and her journey for example how could janie show herself that she is liberated from the confines of her marriage to joe starks
5761888 janie starched and ironed her face and came set in the funeral behind her veil
5761889 like all the other tumbling mud balls janie had tried to show her shine

5761891 a little seed of fear was growing into a tree

5761897 as president ill make our space program a priority again by devoting the attention and resources needed to not only inspire the world with feats of exploration but also improve life here on earth
5761898 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5761899 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of senator obama let me say just in case senator obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting nasa funding i oppose such cuts
5761900 i will ensure that space exploration remains a top priority and that the u s continues to lead the world in this field
5761901 if the u s had tried could it have in any way saved musharraf the answer is no
5761902 after taking off his uniform and once the new government was installed he became progressively weaker by the day even an effort to save him would not have borne fruit it would have prolonged uncertainty
5761903 it took some time for the realization to sink in that that pakistan is gone and that you are not going to go back to that pakistan
5761904 they continued to see him as a factor for stability way beyond what made sense
5761905 we have basically continued to delaying the process by which the new government took charge and started dealing with things time is important because they are dealing with an internal insurgency where the trend lines are bad
5761906 its been a balancing act and not always calibrated to best effect
5761907 at times it appears that bush in particular was coming out too closely aligned with musharraf and was tone deaf to the outrage of pakistani civilians at other times it was clear they were putting their weight behind a political transition that left to his own devices musharraf and his team might not have undertaken
5761908 well see if they can turn their attention to governance and get a handle on their problems
5761909 they have been using the musharraf thing as an excuse for non governance
5761910 were confident that we will maintain a good relationship with the government of pakistan
5761911 he hasnt effectively been leading pakistan for the last six months
5761912 you could count on him to make tough decisions even though you could never count on him to completely follow through
5761913 it will probably be much harder to get decisive action as we did with musharraf
5761914 whut you come in heah wid uh face long as mah arm for
5761915 cause you told me ah mus gointer love him and and i dont
5761916 dats de very prong all us black women gits hung on dis love
5761917 ah dont keer who made it ah dont like de job
5761918 so janie waited a bloom time and a green time and an orange time
5761919 she often spoke to falling seeds and said ah hope you fall on soft ground
5761920 she knew the world was a stallion rolling in the blue pasture of ether
5761921 de nigger woman is de mule uh de world so fur as ah can see
5761922 ah wants sweet things wid mah marriage lak when you sit under a pear tree and think
5761923 but when the pollen again gilded the sun and sifted down on the world she began to stand around the gate and expect things
5761924 janie sent her face to joes funeral and herself went rollicking with the springtime across the world
5761925 some people could look at a mud puddle and see an ocean with ships
5761926 ah done lived grandmas way now ah means tuh live mine
5761927 it was hard to love a woman that always made you feel so wishful
5761928 janie starched and ironed her face and came set in the funeral behind her veil
5761929 you got a lil piece uh fire over there lady
5761930 janie starched and ironed her face and came set in the funeral behind her veil
5761931 like all the other tumbling mud balls janie had tried to show her shine
5761932 the finest thing orange county had ever seen with negro eyes
5761933 what is an appropriate reason to read this passage given what you understand from previous chapters about janie and her journey for example how could janie show herself that she is liberated from the confines of her marriage to joe starks
5761934 janie starched and ironed her face and came set in the funeral behind her veil
5761935 like all the other tumbling mud balls janie had tried to show her shine
5761936 whipped like a cur dog and run off down a back road after things
5761937 i think it would be cool to play in the world series of poker

5761956 in every county i visit they all recognize to be successful and to go forward they have to know understand and use technology
5761957 they emerging market governments have to use technology in education in economic development in health care and to communicate with their citizens
5761958 we dont focus as hard as we should on education
5761959 we dont focus as hard on offering incentives for innovation there is the lack of the r amp d tax credit and thats enough of a political statement for today but the government refuses to acknowledge investing in the future of r amp d and the sort of things we do on a daily basis in our lives is important to the future competitiveness of the u s
5761960 what we wanted to do with kiva is take something that had been off line such as making loans and bring it online for the first time
5761961 one of our biggest challenges has been connectivity and when we went to uganda for the first time the power went out every other day if i wanted to offer some advice to you it would be to take those engineering skills and those software skills and apply them to something you care about
5761962 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
5761963 in 2001 55 of younger white evangelicals identified as republicans nearly three and a half times the number who identified as democrats and more than double the number of americans overall in this age group who identified as republicans throughout bushs first term party identification among younger white evangelicals remained relatively stable but since 2005 the groups republican affiliation has dropped significantly by 15 percentage points
5761964 i dont think this is what the bible meant when it said love thy neighbor as thy self
5761965 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5761966 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5761967 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5761968 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5761969 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5761970 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5761971 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5761972 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5761973 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5761974 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5761975 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5761976 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5761977 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5761978 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5761979 the questionable and misleading signature gathering tactics brought into arizona by connerly have had a far reaching impact on the ballot process generally in our state and a number of propositions have been tossed
5761980 unlike in california arizona does not have a robust private university system
5761981 almost all of our schools are state schools so we wouldnt have had the ability to find alternate scholarships or opportunities for minority students
5761982 im sure the measure is going to be de certified
5761983 the strategy of the those who oppose is to keep us off the ballot
5761984 what are they gonna do say i dont believe you
5761985 we have to pay for any crap thats turned into us it wouldnt surprise me at all if some signature gatherers tried to sneak some names by us
5761986 a ring tone is a very public thing its a way to show you are a condom user and you dont have any issues with it

5761997 weve had a situation time and time again when president bush has gone to a summit meeting you know declared his cooperation with his good friend president putin and then hes gone back to washington and nothing has happened
5761998 why for 15 years after the end of cold war west did do very little to make russia an ally and friend
5761999 every russian leader came to power saying reasonable things about the west and sooner or later something happens which will turn them anti american
5762000 i talk to my friends they basically say america is extremely selfish country and doesnt understand that other people may have different ideas different agendas different approaches
5762001 they do not trust that this effort undertaken by the u s in europe is against iran or against terrorist launches
5762002 they still think that this is against russia why what is the reason that instead of inviting both nations to cooperate closely they fight each other on that
5762003 all of them are in a stupor because they dont know what to say they dont want to speak out and support russia but on the other hand they dont want to come out and oppose russia

5762016 a lot of the efforts we normally do in the development work of providing schools and education are being undermined
5762017 i do not think that world leaders have the bold vision that ultimately will be needed
5762018 we are deeply concerned that the steep rise in global food prices coupled with availability problems in a number of developing countries is threatening global food security and today renew our commitment to address this multifaceted and structural crisis

5762042 the outage was initially widespread from the dargaville township to te kopuru leaving about 1700 households without electricity for about an hour and a half
5762043 the pole that was hit had two different main feeds therefore there were two 11 000 volt circuits on that pole
5762044 we had to disconnect the electricity for safety reasons as fuel and electricity sparks dont mix well

5762048 there is such a thing as disposition temperament manners general attractiveness attitude and demeanour all those things tend to make a person attractive
5762049 they play extremely hard theyre a big physical team we really got to not give them a chance to run their sets we need to play our game and do what weve been doing the whole tournament which is winning playing great defense and making teams rush
5762050 we feel that we can play much better we feel like we can improve and thats what were going to try to do
5762051 if we look after the ball they cant use their speed we are both physical teams so we match there our strength will be our defense we will try to get them out of their comfort zone deny the lanes limit our turnovers and force them to take jump shots
5762052 there is nothing we have that they do not have guards shooters depth defense athleticism
5762053 to win we need a decent shot at the rim late at the clock we need to play without turning over our shots at this point in time no one has spain couldnt do it and greece could not do it

5762056 in the morning i might just sit up and cry with joy
5762057 the hurdles were just coming up too fast and i just couldnt maintain control so i just crashed and burned
5762058 i was in control for half the race but by the 320m mark i felt my right hamstring i pulled my leg through it and it got tighter and tighter
5762059 you know i didnt mess up once the team did well and backed me up walking away with two medals is just so amazing
5762060 this moment feels better than i thought it ever would because ive gone through a lot of hard times this week
5762061 i fulfilled my dream and it means more to me than anything
5762062 to say that i have five medals at my first olympic games means the world to me
5762063 and just having one gold is ok because it team is the one that means the most
5762064 i used the highest level of difficulty and this is the first time ive used it in a competition
5762065 i was very nervous but i had already won two gold medals team floor in these olympic games so my psychological state was much better than my competitors
5762066 hes so physical trains so hard and is beginning to wrestle with his head hell be around in the years to come
5762067 hes done an unbelievable job of overcoming his background not becoming a victim and making the most from the circumstances hes been given
5762068 ive been in a slump and havent performed since the first two games of the preseason
5762069 i just wanted to make a statement that im back
5762070 weve had some battles with australia and russia over the years we all play against each other in teams together in the states and team in europe
5762071 if someone starts thinking ahead theyre in trouble our next opponent is going to be the most difficult yet
5762072 korea is a good team because they won all their previous games and they pitched well today
5762073 but we tried different pitchers because the final stage is more important than today
5762074 i tried to control my passion during the event and be calm
5762075 this is what i wanted to prove from the preliminary to the final to show all i have
5762076 i wasnt going to be tentative my fifth dive is the only thing that bothered me tonight ive trained really really hard the past four years and its paid off with huge dividends i did everything i could
5762077 when there were three of us at the end i knew the medal was safe but i tried to get the gold
5762078 i kept thinking that this was the moment ive been dreaming of i could hear the other guys breathing and i sprinted and now im the olympic winner
5762079 i fought my way back and i was thinking theres no time like the present said whitfield
5762080 it was a battle of willpower as soon as we came together we had a bit of contact and i knew i had trouble
5762081 we dont think too much about it thats the name of the game
5762082 we dont care about the streak were just focusing on that medal
5762083 the best part of the match for us was the beginning of the second set
5762084 but to win we would have had to be perfect we will be cheering for them walsh and may treanor in the final i hope they win because theyre the best
5762085 it was very hard to focus when my competitors were gaining points on me at the last mark i saw a big puff a the left side of the course and i said to myself i already have a medal so why dont i give it a try i went to the left and moved to the front of the fleet
5762086 i waited to make sure that i got the gold at the end of the day and there was only one way to guarantee it sweden knew it was coming too
5762087 we made some mistakes down the stretch but they are taught to deal with them and they did
5762088 i think its good to get the gold medal but thats not the most important thing
5762089 i just came to enjoy the games to enjoy the olympics and i know the chinese girls have done a very good job and we boys cannot be left behind
5762090 of course this gold is for my wife also my friends my german coach and all the people who have helped me
5762091 but first its for her during the competition i did not think so much about her because i had to stay in the competition but afterwards of course i missed her a lot
5762092 i am happy to hear that i have broke it but i can definitely go faster than that
5762093 it was hard for me to get into it today
5762094 i am pretty happy with how i played i had chances and at the crucial moment i just played too short
5762095 transaction levels have now dropped to dangerously low levels that have not been seen in several lifetimes the housing industry cannot sustain this level of trade housebuilders are on their knees if there isnt an improvement soon many will fold as their cashflows will not be able to meet overheads and interest costs

5762100 i made it i finally won a gold medal i cant stop smiling im so excited
5762101 but i go by everything happens for a reason and for some reason the judges were giving me scores im not used to but they had a reason
5762102 it did upset me a little but i thought about it and i decided i was at the olympic games i was having the time of my life and im winning medals
5762103 when you do get silver you feel different emotions but i looked back and appreciated that i had a medal
5762104 if it were gold it might feel differently i dont know how to explain it i definitely came to appreciate it i wouldnt trade my silver medals for anything in the world not even gold
5762105 the more mistakes you make in practice the more you worry
5762106 i wanted to do my best routine i didnt want to leave the olympics thinking i could do better
5762107 if things get worse we can always come back and cut more
5762108 this is about controlling government spending not increasing taxes in new york state and making it less competitive quite honestly than it is right now

5762125 theres a lot of frustration in the camp at the moment because you cannot create chances like we did and not score goals

5762130 sebagian besar museum memang mati akar persoalannya pada kurangnya dana pengelolaan ini terjadi karena museum masih ditempatkan masyarakat sebagai tempat untuk menyimpan benda benda kuno
5762131 museum belum banyak yang berfungi sebagai tempat yang menyenangkan lantaran itu perlu pengelolaan yang profesional di masing masing museum
5762132 it got very sophisticated because obviously the battery doesnt last long and then we had to look at circuits and interrupters so we have been working on it around two months with a crack team
5762133 all vehicles in 2020 will have some level of hybridization
5762134 ini agar tidak lagi terjadi kasus serupa dalam rekrutmen cpns tahun 2009 yang rencananya dimulai pada bulan oktober mendatang pemerintah harus bersikap tegas dalam persoalan ini
5762135 yang itu izin lokasi plta asahan iii nanti saja dulu
5762136 ini bukanlah skor yang bisa kamu lihat setiap hari ketika brasil dan argentina bermain argentina menunjukkan permainan yang hebat
5762137 dengan aturan itu ditegaskan bahwa investor dilarang memperdagangkan sukuk di pasar sekunder itu dinilai bisa menghambat minat investor untuk membeli sbsn karena investor perbankan hanya boleh membeli sukuk untuk dipegang hingga jatuh tempo
5762138 semua laporan yang masuk mulai dari kasus kasus besar yang pernah terjadi seperti pembantaian di beutong ateuh teungku bantaqiah tragedi simpang kka pemerkosaan di rumah geudong pidie bumi flora dan sebagainya akan diperiksa kembali satu per satu
5762139 bila sudah selesai di kpu lalu akan ditandatangani oleh bupati bengkalis dan dilanjutkan untuk persetujuan pengantian antarwaktu oleh gubernur riau
5762140 sebenarnya saya tidak mempersalahkan pencopotan diri saya di dewan saya ikhlas karena jabatan itu hanya amanah dari allah namun kalau dikatakan saya tidak punya kontribusi rasanya tuduhan itu sangat tidak berdasar kalau dikatakan bahwa ada kesepakatan partai tidak ada kesepakatan itu sama sekali
5762141 jika belum ada keputusan pengadilan jangan dikatakan kami menduduki lahan register 40 belum tentu perusahaan yang disebut dinas kehutanan masuk dalam kawasan hutan kami minta jangan dilaksanakan dahulu sebelum ada keputusan pengadilan
5762142 jika belum ada keputusan pengadilan jangan ada ekspos ke publik yang menuding kami di kawasan hutan ini menyulitkan kami berurusan dengan bank pihak bank sudah mulai menanyakan apakah perusahaan kami ada di dalam kawasan atau tidak
5762143 lahan seluas ini luar biasa tidak bisa dinas kehutanan serta merta meminta kawasan ini dikosongkan begitu saja
5762144 tidak semua yang ada di dalam data tersebut benar faktanya salah satunya lahan yang duduki ptpn iv kenyataannya ptpn iv tidak pernah menduduki lahan register 40
5762145 sepanjang dokumen pelepasan belum ada maka pengusahaan kawasan itu ilegal pemerintah daerah yang ikut memberi izin bisa menjadi pihak yang akan disidik petugas
5762146 a natural result of the continued israeli crimes against our people

5762150 we are small and dont really have anything worth stealing
5762151 they had details of explosives and poisons along with information about london landmarks and a computer folder on royal residences wed be foolish to rule out the fact that they may have been planning an attack
5762152 why does someone need a suitcase or oversized bag for a one hour church service
5762153 we condemn those who hide under the cloak of promoting virtue and preventing vice
5762154 the promotion of virtue and the prevention of vice is done in the mosques and not in the streets
5762155 religious hardliners lost many followers because of their rigid way of interpreting islam and are now using force to bring people back
5762156 i was beaten and given electric shocks through the back hands and feet until i was on the point of losing consciousness but when they attached the wires to my ears that was real torture
5762157 for our program i think it would be huge to win the gold it would be a big boost we joke that when we win the world championship we still only make page c7 in usa today
5762158 you see other people getting medals here every day and you just want one for yourself
5762159 its a great feeling to know you dont have to play for a place play for bronze this is such a great feeling
5762160 its so exciting so thrilling its great to look into the eyes of your teammates and coaches and see tears of joy
5762161 the thought that that was it did cross my mind
5762162 but then i looked into my teammates eyes and i knew there was no way we were going to lose
5762163 theres this thing they have in french lesprit descalier the spirit of the stairway i dont think we have a word for it in english
5762164 it means well the clever things to say that you only think to yourself when youre on your way out
5762165 all the cool stuff you wish youd said at the time
5762166 you goof that isnt what its like up here at all
5762167 la relation entre les etats unis et le pakistan ne va pas beaucoup changer

5762169 hes got money so he gets to do what he wants

5762172 rick warren admits mccain was late for forum and then says were attacking the secret service
5762173 mccain country first well except when im making propaganda films for the north vietnamese uhm erm uh zzzzzzzz damn kids get the hell offa my lawn
5762174 frankly the elderly also drive cars until somebody tells them they cant

5762177 fingers crossed i will keep going for a while yet both for northern ireland and birmingham
5762178 i am very proud to be the captain as it is a great honour i was very surprised when the manager nigel worthington called me
5762179 i am looking forward to leading the boys out and getting a good result on the end of it
5762180 hampden is one of the places i have not played in my career so i am relishing savouring the atmosphere
5762181 maik has been through many situations internationally and club wise
5762182 what i do know is by giving him the armband it wont take away from his performance
5762183 he was brilliant for us last season and has got over the disappointment of being relegated
5762184 he has come back strong and helped us get off to a great start this season
5762185 he seems happy at the moment every day in training he gives it his all he has a great will to win and you can see he hates to lose
5762186 apart from david healy steven has been our most influential player to be honest i dont know why he cant get into the fulham side
5762187 if the move comes off he will be a fantastic acquisition for rangers good luck to him he seems very keen on the move
5762188 i am quite comfortable with the group and quite content going into what should be a great game between two of the home nations
5762189 were forced to ask what can be done after dark how do ones attitudes change and how are rules and expectations altered when the clock hits a certain hour
5762190 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5762191 obama hits back at mccain cheap shots in vfw speech
5762192 i dont know about you but this is gonna be one long drunken metro ride home
5762193 pardon my ignorance but why is the chancellor able to e mail me back with a multiple sentence response but george parker cannot send a one word reply
5762194 you dont respond to emails your voice mail is full the website is not updated and you release no statements to let teachers know where we are in this negotiations process
5762195 it is degrading and insulting for teachers to have to interview with a principal before accepting a position in that school teachers are doing a terrific job
5762196 he seemed so incredibly pumped about it and naama was glowing even though matthew had to mingle with his cast mates and the shows producers during the party he was so attentive to her it was sweet
5762197 sehari dua ini mungkin ada berita baik harga minyak boleh dikaji semula
5762198 kalau harga minyak dunia turun kerajaan boleh turunkan harga minyak ini boleh ditunaikan
5762199 the current environment is the harshest we have seen in many years and with inflation growing at its fastest pace in almost two decades we do not see any indication of meaningful near term improvement
5762200 target has never been a place people think of when they want to shop for food
5762201 people still think of wal mart for low prices thats hurt target during the economic downturn
5762202 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5762203 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5762204 the customer is very cash strapped right now and in some ways our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge
5762205 during these tough times some of our consumers dont want to be tempted as much as they have in the past
5762206 courage is the discovery that you may not win and trying when you know you can lose
5762207 i would never blame individuals for the team not lifting a trophy we are in it together we win as a team and we lose as a team
5762208 as individuals we all make mistakes and the message i was relaying to a czech newspaper was that we are more experienced now and have learnt from last season
5762209 weve got a good nucleus of a squad now but were a little thin in terms of numbers if we get injuries
5762210 with the money ive got to spend i could probably bring in 10 players but they wouldnt be the right ones
5762211 we have seen a feel good factor generated when england won the rugby
5762212 in the olympics we are looking to put a football team in four years time and someone has got to manage it
5762213 i have not heard a dickie bird from middlesbrough they have gone nowhere near him
5762214 i couldnt say if anyone will come in for any of my players before the deadline
5762215 we are constantly looking for ways to provide media distributors flexibility in delivering premium content to their end users
5762216 extendmedias opencase proven through many successful implementations in north america alleviates the heavy lifting required by our customers and can quickly efficiently and securely deliver premium entertainment distribution across three screens
5762217 our partnership with mitsubishi and ub cross is a significant one that allows extendmedia to create an imprint on a global scale
5762218 based on initial reaction from service operators in japan we anticipate strong demand for our offerings
5762219 on each of the computers is information which can be used by identity thieves
5762220 be prepared to make a call for each member of your family who was reported on any income tax return in the last eight years
5762221 i urge you for your own protection to make the phone calls to the agencies and bureaus above right now
5762222 ive seen really good crooks turn around and use that information in a matter of minutes
5762223 we shouldve known right away this was six days ago
5762224 im going to do what they say and going to go to a phone and call all of credit bureau fraud departments right now
5762225 right now we are focusing on replacing our computer system
5762226 on each of the computers is information which can be used by identity thieves
5762227 be prepared to make a call for each member of your family who was reported on any income tax return in the last eight years
5762228 i urge you for your own protection to make the phone calls to the agencies and bureaus above right now

5762231 im going to do what they say and going to go to a phone and call all of credit bureau fraud departments right now
5762232 right now we are focusing on replacing our computer system
5762233 the question remains how late are we in the game in the credit crisis
5762234 even though the answer over the past few weeks seemed to be pretty late in the game there are still key issues coming up
5762235 i think people thought its tiger woods hell be back in two months but it just doesnt work that way
5762236 he feels good about it i talked to him sunday night for a long time on the phone and hes making great progress working hard hes in the pool on the bike the acl is a long rehab thats just the way it is
5762237 some people might not like relegation promotion relegation promotion but would you want to be a middlesbrough stuck in mid table every season
5762238 some people would settle for that because it is better for your heart but the highs and lows are what football is all about for me
5762239 i was amused to read davids comments that he would rather his side suffered relegation every other season than be like middlesbrough
5762240 david is a good friend but i can only assume relegation has affected his thinking a little
5762241 i seriously doubt boro fans would swap our recent histories
5762242 since moving to the riverside in 1995 we have achieved five major cup finals are the only english side outside of the so called big four to have played in a european final have enjoyed successive seasons of uefa cup football won our first major trophy and enjoyed 11 consecutive years in the premier league
5762243 this statement seems to show that cms is finally making the connection between its misguided directive and the real kids it could hurt
5762244 reality is the bush administration should not be applauded because nothing has changed
5762245 through this directive they are still committed to denying childrens access to health care
5762246 most states believe that if cms wants to make a change they should issue regulations or seek legislation
5762247 can be blamed on the passage of time more than anything
5762248 would have to either cover fewer children or raise more revenue perhaps by bumping up the tobacco tax increase that it already proposes
5762249 given how delicate the balance between coverage and costs was in the existing bill such a move could cause problems
5762250 i have previously advised liverpool over two danes with daniel agger and nicola savic both of whom they purchased and are almost too happy with
5762251 i gave them mathias jorgensens name a long time ago and liverpool are wild about him
5762252 we must ensure that prevention and treatment services continue to help those most in need
5762253 i was at an open mic in one of hippest downtown coffee shops last week there was a guy angry as hell about the war capitalism all the while reading his piece from his new 3g iphone it doesnt add up to me
5762254 you would be ignoring the will of the voters to put this back on the ballot
5762255 no one is indispensable and the roof of city hall did not and will not collapse
5762256 omg edward you glitter in the sun just like mary kate amp ashley all over shimmering color
5762257 bowl with remnants of milk miniwheats these breakfast ruins on the counter perhaps the dishwasher door was too heavy or douchebaggery
5762258 abe coming back the way he did that was a great game he pitched
5762259 theyre doing it at the right time the pitchers are going late into the games and saving the bullpen
5762260 its good because we have to work for everything were getting right now
5762261 everybodys working pretty hard to get there they feel good about themselves
5762262 whats good about us is if theres a guy on second with less than two outs were going to try and get them over for the next guy
5762263 the big thing is if i dont get my job done other guys will pick me up
5762264 guys are starting to understand that if we dont get the job done we have confidence in the guys behind us that they will pick us up
5762265 he jammed his hip a little bit going back to first base
5762266 we had a big lead there was no sense in taking a chance and running him out there anymore im sure if he gets some rest tonight hell be fine tomorrow
5762267 this is a big first step in using mass media to connect enthusiastic members of crustacean nation with the blue crabs on more regular basis we expect to build this out next year with many more games including road game
5762268 i am excited to be a part of the crustacean nation family and look forward to bringing blue crabs baseball into the homes and offices of our fans
5762269 i hope to have a lot of fun over the next month and trust that fans will enjoy the ability to listen to our games
5762270 if you look at when the market reacts the most violently it is to news about financials
5762271 the question remains how late are we in the game in the credit crisis
5762272 even though the answer over the past few weeks seemed to be pretty late in the game there are still key issues coming up
5762273 the zoominfo public api provides free access to zoominfos people database and company database that contain over 40 million people and nearly 4 million companies respectively the zoominfo people data and company data are accessed using a simple rest query api
5762274 the zoominfo company search api gives you the ability to
5762275 i come here tonight with a cure for a broken heart as well
5762276 im preaching to me as much as im preaching to you tonight
5762277 some people have asked me whether i am angry at god because my son is no longer here
5762278 but how can i be mad at a god who holds my son safely in his arms tonight its hard knowing that i wont see my son again on earth but i have the assurance that christopher is in heaven because he put his faith in jesus i havent lost my son because i know where he is and someday i will join him
5762279 heaven is not the default destination when you die you have to choose it jesus christ paid your way to heaven when he died on the cross for you but you must make your own choice to follow him
5762280 he was artistic director of harvest and oversaw the design of the stage the event program and the harvest crusades bumper stickers
5762281 i was really happy with aguero today he scored two goals and he played fantastic
5762282 this team has committed themselves to each match at the olympics to try and win the gold medal
5762283 this is what they will continue to do against nigeria in the final nigeria is a really strong team we want to savour this win over brazil first
5762284 of course this will put more pressure and there will be some doubts about me as the coach and the team but i have faith in my work and in my players
5762285 we will evaluate this defeat and look into the problem areas and we will study everything this is what happens in football sometimes you win sometimes you lose but the most important thing is we have to put our heart into it
5762286 despite a decade of national prosperity the former manufacturing backbone of the u s is in rougher shape than ever still searching for some way to replace its long stilled smokestacks
5762287 which racked up four of the 10 cities on our list youngstown canton dayton and cleveland
5762288 it takes both sunshine and rain to make a rainbow
5762289 the tourists appear to have little regard for the neighborhood and its residents
5762290 they view the stop as akin to visiting a zoo or other attraction where they are entertained by exhibits or animals
5762291 i recently felt so alone and homesick i looked down at the shirt your company had sent me and it was a reminder that others back home are thinking of us
5762292 this year the party that wins the battle of the conventions will likely win the election
5762293 the candidates want to stoke the speculation with nods hints and winks to get as much visibility as they can for the ultimate announcement
5762294 cbssports com has been a pioneer in the live sports video space for years with the huge success of productions such as march madness on demand and amen corner live
5762295 we understand the importance of live games and information and were thrilled to again be breaking new ground with fantasy football today the first live nfl themed production to be fully integrated with a network studio show and feature live interviews with talent from stadiums across the country we expect fantasy football today to quickly become the premiere destination for fantasy players on sunday mornings
5762296 we employ too many people and must saturate our content with ads
5762297 due to technical problems jungle coaster will be running on a reduced number of trains
5762298 the canals that usually have enough water to be navigable are almost dry when the water comes back up to a normal level we plan to resume these operations we appreciate everyones patience
5762299 seperti mimpi yang menjadi kenyataan saya telah mengikuti perjalanan klub ini selama bertahun tahun di psg pernah ada rai ronaldinho dan jay jay okocha saya kira klub ini memiliki sesuatu yang spesial
5762300 its just an attempt to scare the israeli public which is apparently working pretty well with all the superfluous media coverage
5762301 i am announcing now that iran is ready to launch satellites of friendly islamic countries into space
5762302 creating a special new home for tink and her friends which promises to immerse guests in the world of pixie dust at walt disney world
5762303 beginning in 2009 disney grad nite will take place at disneys hollywood studios the class of 2009 will be the first to experience this all new event
5762304 commodities the stuff that feeds us runs our cars heats our homes and provides the basic materials of everyday life recently enjoyed one of the great bull runs of modern investment history nearly doubling in price in the space of a year

5762310 we modified the sun ultra 24 and developed a lightweight high capacity rackmount workstation with features that are not available in suns currently x86 product offerings
5762311 the strong performance of autotrader com for two consecutive years is founded on its most notable strengths the quality of leads and the amount of contact with the dealership both of which are especially important to dealers
5762312 cars com has been steadily improving in the used vehicle lead segment rankings during the past two years so it is not surprising that the service improves from its second rank position in 2007 to earn the highest rank in 2008
5762313 as both new and used vehicle sales decline it is now more important than ever for dealers to cast as wide a net as possible toward the limited supply of vehicle shoppers which is one reason why dealers are increasing their use of online lead providers in the hopes of generating more traffic and sales for their dealerships
5762314 also dealers use vehicle lead notification systems to try to differentiate themselves from their competitors through faster lead response times in this highly competitive industry creating even a slight edge over other dealers is critical during a period of slow sales
5762315 did not use all means to respond then but if lebanon becomes a hezbollah state then we wont have any restrictions in this regard
5762316 the next war will reach the cities and homes of israeli citizens and the goal of our enemy will be to hurt the home front
5762317 gone are the days when wars are fought on remote and hidden battlefields while life in the cities carries on as usual
5762318 we dont need to scare ourselves too much with regards to the threats
5762319 ultimately the threat that we foresee in our imaginations is more demonic than it really is
5762320 in many respects the home front command will be the first and most important command in any future war and i am impressed by the astounding progress in its readiness and the change in its mindset

5762384 de blob es una historia de hero smo revolucionario el colorido mundo de raydia ha sido invadido por un grupo de monocrom ticos enemigos conocidos como la corporaci n inkt el camarada negro y sus secuaces inky han descendido sobre la capital art stica chroma city y purgado el color la m sica y la felicidad la corporaci n inkt ha implementado una nueva visi n de la sociedad gobernada por el silencio la obediencia y el aburrimiento
5762385 ellos est n luchando contra ese regimen para hacer el mundo divertido brillante y feliz una vez m s su objetivo es pintar chroma city llenando las calles de m sica y color liberando a los ciudadanos de la mon tona vida bajo inkt su objetivo ltimo es liberar a raydia de las fuerzas opresivas de inkt
5762386 adem s de pintar tambi n hay que saltar y desplazarse alredor de chroma de blob en su coraz n es un plataformas por lo que el jugador con un n mero de t cnicas de plataformas que le permiten llegar a partes en apariencia inaccesibles de la ciudad y para ejecutar maniobras cada vez m s complejas para acabar con tus enemigos los revolucionarios del color son tambi n responsables de dar a de blob diferentes tipos de misiones desde pintar a participar en carreras o pruebas de combate el profesor l der del la resistencia del color ha dise ado unas armas secreta que puede ayudar a transformar la ciudad la principal es el motor de transformaci n que funciona con energ a de color que de blob genera una vez que tenga suficiente la m quina puede dar color a amplias zonas de la ciudad
5762387 hay 10 cap tulos en la historia principal cada cap tulo est fijado en un suburbio de chroma city y cada suburbio tiene varias secciones los suburbios tiene su propio ambiente y su abanico de retos cada escenario tiene adem s un a adido en forma de niveles de sprint que son mini pruebas basadas en el tiempo cada nivel tiene su propio tema musical y una arquitectura caracter stica de modo que todo se combina para proporcionar nuevos retos y una experiencia de juego diversa a medida que la historia se desarrolla los retos para de blob se hacen m s complejos y los enemigos m s duros e incluso dependiendo de lo bien que se juegue se pueden abrir nuevas mini pruebas
5762388 a pesar de ser una masa de gelatina de blob tiene habilidades heroicas que le permiten volar sobre el escenario y evadir enemigos pintando la ciudad en el proceso l puede saltar delizarse rebotar y golpear puede correr por los muros y tambi n tiene un repertorio de cl sicos del g nero
5762389 nos hemos divertido mucho haciendo de blob y nos encanta wii como su hogar cualquiera que se ponga a los mandos de blob reconocer inmediatamente c mo los controles afectan a las mec nicas de juego pintar chroma city atacar a los tanques de inkt y las torretas deslizarse hac a abajo de desde un rascacielos todo encaja perfectamente una vez que coges los mandos
5762390 de blob es un t tulo muy distinto de la demo original para pc el estilo art stico los elementos de plataformas el control del jugador y muchas mec nicas han sido completamente replanteadas para wii el control del jugador fue dise ado concretamente para wii quer amos aprovechar la naturaleza t ctil de wii para hacer que los jugadores sintieran la pintura a su alrededor en homenaje conservamos algunos de los elementos de historia de la demo original hemos hecho todo lo posible en honrar el juego de pc original y en el proceso de blob para wii se ha convertido en un juego por su derecho propio
5762391 uno de nuestros objetivos principales de de blob era el de crear un mundo y un ambiente que tomara ventaja del hardware de wii para crear una gran experiencia visual en la est tica del juego han participado artistas callejeros de todo el mundo tiene un ambiente muy urbano pero sin ser realmente un juego de graffitis creemos que es uno de los m s atractivos t tulos para wii hasta la fecha los jugadores no echar n de menos m s capacidad de proceso
5762392 hemos desarrollado un sistema de m sica interactiva que funciona en conjunci n con la pintura de modo que los jugadores puedan sentir que est n mezclando m sica al pintar el pueblo toda la m sica ha sido grabada en directo con una orquesta de soul de 10 piezas un revolucionario ritmo que se mueve desde el funk al soul pasando por disco y hip hop cada color tiene un instrumento asociado que fluir en la banda sonora de forma natural a medida que pintes con ese color
5762393 en el comienzo empiezas a jugar sin color y sin m sica y poco a poco va surgiendo cada pieza de la orquesta a medida que pintes m s secciones de la ciudad
5762394 la naturaleza interactiva de la m sica implica que puedes combinar melod as con niveles por lo que si tienes una melod a favorita puedes llevarla a otra fase y ver c mo suena en esa secci n del juego
5762395 me encanta el pack completo que estamos logrando con de blob los cortes realizados por nuestro equipo de animaci n son fant sticos y divertidos la pintura y el audio se combinan de una forma que nunca he experimentado en un videojuego antes los gr ficos la m sica el mundo de chroma city son algo de lo que sentirse orgullosos y pensamos que eso lo convertir en una compra obligada para este a o y deseamos que los jugadores sientan el cuidado que hemos puesto en el juego de blob es una divertida y provechosa experiencia que pensamos que excitar a los fans de wii es diferente divertido y original los factores a los que damos m s importancia en el estudio

5762536 what have you done for me lately buddy and what will you do for me
5762537 payment overdue please call xxx xxx xxxx to remit payment to avoid system termination
5762538 i kind of fought my way on there and i thought theres no time like the present
5762539 i tried to make it a battle of pure willpower i gave it everything i had
5762540 this is the olympics this is it why play it safe
5762541 you might as well put it all on the line and go for broke and it paid off today with a silver medal
5762542 it was really close when i saw photo finish i was on pins and needles i didnt know what happened
5762543 all of us just went for that line it was an intense race and i came through and got the third so im very pleased
5762544 i raced that like a heat not like a final
5762545 if i raced that like a final i could have probably expected another half second maybe thats saying a lot considering the time but thats how i felt
5762546 why cant the guys wear shorts or something waterproof every time they went into a spin i felt like ballsweat was going to splatter on my face
5762547 im going to bring my 4 year old to expose him to culture even though he really just wants to pick his nose and use the picnic table as a fort
5762548 hello my name is grace and im a sf ballet holic

5762552 berry is lucky he got away with what he was doing for as long as he did
5762553 its a miracle he wasnt caught sooner i mean he was pretty blatant about what he was doing stealing bases right out in the open in a stadium full of fans and hundreds of witnesses

5762555 my work is never about what really happened because i dont know what happened its more how we talk about it how it comes to us what we do with these images what sense we can make with it who says what at what point and how it enters our subconscious library of images
5762556 it has been a while since i wrote my previous review
5762557 you know i would have thought it was 4 bucks too
5762558 oh you mean the crazyforeignicantrememeberwhattocallit beer youll love it its got a great bite

5762561 last friday the day before the lake tahoe summit i slipped and broke my left ankle while i was on a walk with congresswoman ellen tauscher on the meeks bay trail in the tahoe forest my doctor has advised me not to travel in the short term and so regretfully i am unable to attend what will surely be an historic convention in denver i was very much looking forward to chairing the california delegation and i offer my best wishes to californias delegates in this vital nomination process
5762562 we cant have strong enforcement of our clean air laws unless we know what polluters are putting into the air
5762563 the bush epa went out of its way to overturn a system that required states to adequately monitor air pollution at power plants and factories instead epa actually outlawed states from requiring monitoring good enough to protect the health of their citizens epas consistent polluter biased practices have amounted to industry foxes having a house party in the henhouse
5762564 today the court slapped down epas see no evil approach to the clean air act which would have eliminated emissions monitoring required by law responding to an outstanding argument by earthjustice the court understood that emission standards that arent monitored can never be enforced todays opinion is only the latest in series of decisions that have thoroughly rejected epas seven year campaign to unravel the clean air act
5762565 the federal appeals court held that communities across america have the right to know the amount of air pollution discharged by thousands of industrial sources
5762566 the court reinstated bedrock public health protections undermined by what it properly called an epa about face and sharply admonished the agency to carry out the nations clean air laws
5762567 public health should be a top priority not polluters profits
5762568 todays decision will give states back the tools they need to hold polluters accountable and help ensure that everyone has clean healthy air to breathe
5762569 the chinese government is desperate to turn the worlds attention away from its abuses in tibet as the olympics take place but the creativity and determination of tibetans and their supporters has once again ensured that tibetan voices are heard and seen in beijing despite the massive security clampdown
5762570 the chinese leadership must realize that the only way it can make the issue of tibet disappear is to acknowledge the demands of the tibetan people and work with them to bring an end to chinas occupation of tibet
5762571 the air district cant keep giving away air pollution credits that dont exist in the first place especially in the dirtiest air basin in the country
5762572 it is unfortunate that the very agency charged with protecting our air continues to pollute it
5762573 for decades the air district has given out credits to countless polluters without bothering to keep track of where the credits came from where they went and whether they had enough credits to cover all the emissions they were allowing
5762574 we are asking the court to stop this practice immediately and force the air district to clean up the air in the communities that hosted the unlawful pollution
5762575 people living in the south coast air basin should not be forced to sacrifice their familys health and lives breathing dirty air justified with fraudulent credits
5762576 the polluting facilities accessing these credits can afford the best pollution control technologies but choose to make higher profits and choose to locate these facilities in low income and poor communities that can ill afford any more pollution
5762577 in south east los angeles where there are lots of polluting facilities we look to the district to ensure that companies are operating in compliance with air quality laws and protecting public health
5762578 this is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development transportation planning and environmental policies
5762579 health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning but that doesnt erase the immediate risk to school age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now
5762580 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
5762581 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
5762582 major roads play an important role in the economy but we need to strike a balance between economic and health considerations as we break ground on new areas
5762583 policymakers need to develop new effective strategies that would encourage urban planners to reconsider our current infrastructure particularly when it comes to building new schools and maintaining existing ones
5762584 this is the first study that shows the contribution of ships to fine particulates in the atmosphere
5762585 ships are really unregulated when it comes to air pollution standards what we wanted to find out was the contribution of ships to the air pollution in san diego and what we found was a surprise because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulfur rich particles called primary sulfate would be so high
5762586 the importance of primary sulfate is usually ignored in assessments of the impact of ship emissions on air quality because less than 7 percent of all sulfur emitted by ships is found in primary sulfate particles
5762587 but our results suggest that this component of ship emissions is important and should not be ignored in the future knowing how much sulfate from ships is in the air will also allow us to better understand what happens to the other 93 percent of sulfur emitted by ships
5762588 we found that in san diego the port of los angeles can be a significant influence on air quality because these fine particulates can travel so far
5762589 this will tell us whether californias new regulation requiring cleaner burning fuel 24 miles off the coast is having the effect its intended to have
5762590 and because a large part of the worlds population live in major cities with shipping ports such as new york city san francisco hong kong houston and singapore and global shipping is expected to increase in the decades to come this should help policy makers around the world make more informed decisions about improving the health of their citizens
5762591 ein chinese w rde sich wundern wollte man ihm weismachen ein johannes gutenberg in deutschland h tte vor rund 550 jahren das drucken erfunden
5762592 nachdem ihr deutsch china verliess habe ich alle anlage sperrenlassen prufen sie bitte jetzt das sind ihren vermoegen
5762593 wir sind froh dass wir die silber holten fuer uns ist es wie gold
5762594 i wish president musharraf all the best we have had difficult days together but also we had good days together all in all we had a good relationship
5762595 the most important thing is not personalities what is important is that we change our expectations and the way we formulate policies to meet those expectations
5762596 if they are doing that in order to get strategic depth it will not happen it has been tried before it failed if they are doing that in order to have a puppet government it will not happen it will not work
5762597 if they are doing that to gain an upper hand against another of their neighbors
5762598 in west bengal there will be road and rail blockades all air services will be stalled as the federation of airport employees have also joined the call for the general strike
5762599 every experience god gives us every person he puts in our lives is the perfect preparation for the future that only he can see
5762600 if it wasnt that i formed her myself i would swear on myself that this chick doesnt have a brain
5762601 i was really happy with aguero today he scored two goals and he played fantastic
5762602 this team has committed themselves to each match at the olympics to try and win the gold medal
5762603 this is what they will continue to do against nigeria in the final nigeria is a really strong team we want to savour this win over brazil first
5762604 of course this will put more pressure and there will be some doubts about me as the coach and the team but i have faith in my work and in my players
5762605 we will evaluate this defeat and look into the problem areas and we will study everything this is what happens in football sometimes you win sometimes you lose but the most important thing is we have to put our heart into it
5762606 sono molto soddisfatto dei ragazzi anche se mi dispiace per camoranesi ma trattandosi di unamichevole non voglio rischiarlo
5762607 mi sembra di non essere mai andato via da qui c grande entusiasmo ho rivisto lo spirito di gruppo che conoscevo
5762608 potrebbero esserci tre punte anche in considerazione dellassenza di camoranesi e unidea che mi affascina nella misura in cui questi attaccanti si mettono a disposizione della squadra anche in difesa
5762609 training the last few days has been really intense i think people are realising this is already the business end of the year
5762610 it starts with the roosters on friday night and we really have to start stepping up
5762611 we should have won that game last weekend the warriors were there for the taking but we werent good enough
5762612 a lot of the experts are going to say well they cant win but it just takes that belief and confidence thats all you need
5762613 three weeks out from the finals and its time to get some red cordial have some coffee and do whatever you can to get a bit excited
5762614 we have to stand up and win big games on the big stage
5762615 to be honest were not worried about that youd think we only have to win another game and were in the top four
5762616 were all thinking top four would be nice but how many we score and how many we give away we havent been worried about
5762617 defensively we know that if we turn up then we only need to score 16 roughly to win
5762618 i know they throw up statistics that our defence can be poor and we cant score points i just think its a different ball game in the semi finals and ive had the pleasure of playing in a few
5762619 theres been a little bit of that already people coming up to you in the street and saying theyve been waiting 40 years
5762620 its not our fault what happened in the past all we can worry about is this year
5762621 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5762622 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour
5762623 unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
5762624 the icc has got the unambiguous understanding from a collective view on pakistan
5762625 hopefully the icc having now heard the concerns of the players will make a common sense decision and move the event
5762626 if the tournament is moved to sri lanka we will have to go through the same security process with cricket australia that we did for pakistan
5762627 our major concern is time with only 20 days to the start of the event
5762628 weve discussed this with the experts who acknowledge that westerners are targets in pakistan where as the biggest danger in sri lanka appears to be collateral damage
5762629 certainly we will need a detailed security assessment of sri lanka should the tournament be moved there before making any decisions
5762630 i will continue to work until a new chairman is appointed and i dont see my leaving affecting the champions trophy because pcb is an institution and institutions are not run by individuals
5762631 this is amazing i cant believe it i dont what to say
5762632 oh my god youve got to be kidding me is this for real
5762633 i was more pumped than i have ever been in my life i dont even know how i got out
5762634 i saw lolo jones go down and i thought go for it and i did
5762635 anything less than the final and she would have been gutted absolutely devastated
5762636 there was no pressure once she was in the final
5762637 those first two rounds were the tough part of the deal
5762638 weve got two halfbacks with us and theres other players as well with us this time whove played in that position before the likes of matt giteau
5762639 i think in the first instance it probably wouldnt be a surprise to you that well look to experience
5762640 so im giving you an insight there that we dont normally do ive broken protocol there
5762641 experience is valuable but it comes down to how you use that
5762642 what previous experience in these sort of contests gives you is an insight but if you then dont use that to your best advantage then its not much value
5762643 well consider our selection and that will pertain to the springboks
5762644 well look at what we believe will serve us best we havent made those decisions yet believe it or not so well have those discussions and well settle on a combination
5762645 after such a tough journey for all i care this silver medal could be a gold
5762646 its been really tough many ups and downs seven months out from the olympic games and fracturing your c2 vertebrae and seeing pretty much all your olympic dreams go out the window
5762647 i went into the final with the attitude that i was going to throw the kitchen sink at it and she threw the kitchen sink at me hats off to vicky
5762648 in the third round she crashed i nearly crashed and then i thought i won and then i was eating humble pie because it turned out id actually lost
5762649 and then she got relegated and then i won oh man it was just one of those rides
5762650 this is the one ive really had to fight for
5762651 i think it has made me tougher as an athlete made me more focused and passionate
5762652 the fact that i came so close to losing it all makes me want to come back harder this is a challenge for me it would have been easy to give up sit on the couch and feel sorry for myself but i just didnt want to do that
5762653 i think it could be somewhere between 40 and 42
5762654 considering we tried to sell bejeweled outright to more than one industry giant back in the early days of our company and got no takers even after reducing our asking price to 60 000 this little game has done all right for itself
5762655 i vividly recall prospective buyers telling us its not even a game while showing us the door
5762656 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of
5762657 we are not against the tatas or bringing more industry into bengal
5762658 but there can be no concession in our demand that the farmers land should be returned to them
5762659 if we give back the land we will have to acquire it elsewhere and that would create fresh trouble
5762660 we have not received any communication from the tatas saying they want to pull out
5762661 while the default installation provides a relatively secure system it may not always meet organizational security requirements this guide is aimed at users in environments requiring stronger security controls in their operating system making full use of the protection features offered by mac os x 10 5

5762663 the chemicals spread throughout the house the methamphetamine is deposited everywhere from walls and carpets to microwaves tabletops and clothing children living in those labs might as well be taking the drug directly
5762664 were going to favor those publishers that recognize and appreciate how much we can add value to their artists were introducing a whole new group of artists to new audiences that is resulting in their itunes downloads being exponentially higher than they would otherwise be as well as new album sales and new merchandising opportunities we hope that our partners in the gaming space appreciate not only the value of their own contributions but also those of the recording artists songwriters record labels and music publishers on which their games are significantly based
5762665 its been well spoken about how melbourne has adopted a youth policy
5762666 i havent been told anything yet ive got a meeting with them next week but obviously the writing is on the wall
5762667 but i dont feel like im anywhere near ready for retirement yet i want to play and if i dont play with melbourne id love to play somewhere else
5762668 i understand that im not going to be on big money i understand that i may not be the first ruckman im comfortable with that i just want to play
5762669 if i dont get the chance to play elsewhere ill be very happy with my career and satisfied im not fearful of retirement
5762670 im fearful of leaving with games still in me of not trying to continue ive still got a lot of life football life left inme
5762671 its not a financial decision its a motivation to play football thats still strong
5762672 and if i go to a club with young emerging ruckmen i think that would be ideal
5762673 thats probably the first time i had a bit of a cry when the british national anthem was playing
5762674 i have a fantastic boss and hes had to manage a real rough diamond in myself
5762675 hes had to take all the knocks when i go off the handle daves always been there for me rock solid no way would i ever walk off this program
5762676 i get on really well with shane we are very close
5762677 a rough diamond you can say that again but we complement one another as we are different in the way we work
5762678 im calm and dont often lose my temper hes more volatile and you need to be like that sometimes but it needs to be done in the right way i am very much a believer in the carrot not the stick but the main thing i admire and respect in shane is hes a winner a driven guy
5762679 we were going nowhere in the pursuit for a couple of years then shane came in and gave us a kick up the arse
5762680 what attracted me to stay was that i was given a real opportunity in coaching that i wasnt given in australia
5762681 any athlete who rides a bike knows just how good how awesome that performance was
5762682 you see certain things in life that amaze and that was one of them
5762683 i admit that seeing the boys up there with their medals as the anthem played got to me there was massive expectation on them you dont continually break world records as we have done without building expectation when they brought home the medal i felt relief that id got my job right
5762684 until that time we thought ourselves to being the best of british you know driven by pride but we then came to a point where that was no longer enough we came to the point where we wanted to be the best in the world
5762685 if you want to get an athlete on the podium you need a coach of the same calibre if we havent got the right british person for the job we said wed get an australian one or a german one or whatever nationality it took
5762686 of course i found his death difficult to deal with but the man had so many health and emotional problems that in some ways im happy he cant do himself any more harm
5762687 my family and training for the olympics have helped me get over my dad
5762688 the staff are the minions and the athletes are the kings and queens of their world
5762689 ill be discussing my future after these games and i think its time for me to let some of our brilliant young coaches have their heads
5762690 whatever role i have i have faith in this program and we have a massive array of talent backing up what youve seen here we will be doing our damnedest to stay on top of the world right through until london 2012
5762691 we will be trying to get her back on the court if not for the semi final then for the final
5762692 it does look quite significant at this point in time
5762693 if she is not ready to go then thats sport
5762694 thats one hole thats been created and someone else will have to step up
5762695 we probably need our whole group but stranger things have happened in the game of basketball
5762696 athletics is what hes concentrated on over the last four years because he has only played league spasmodically
5762697 but he just decided he wanted to play league his goal now is rugby league long term and thats what were looking at at the moment
5762698 im into athletics as well but footys looking good at the moment im having fun playing that
5762699 the nerves should be all right on saturday night but you never really know until the day
5762700 im sure he didnt expect to be where he is now at the beginning of the year
5762701 hes taken his opportunities hes played well and hes physically a big kid and up to it so well give him a shot and see how he goes
5762702 hes a pretty laidback sort of kid so i dont think it will phase him too much
5762703 on the sunday afternoon of the last session we were catching the high ball and it was like a circus act
5762704 i nicknamed him the mantis he can do anything with the ball in the air
5762705 he was climbing up peoples backs and catching the ball over his head he was just unbelievable
5762706 they are mostly charges that people are able to easily bond out on so they dont end up staying in jail
5762707 its probably the reason why there arent so many folks in jail
5762708 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5762709 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
5762710 we have not heard anything officially from cricket australia and until we do we are not in a position to make any comment
5762711 what we have done is to very clearly outline to each of these stakeholders the plan that we have in place for the champions trophy in pakistan
5762712 understandably there are safety concerns and thats what we are engaged in and we are dealing with
5762713 the ecb has received a briefing from us and have gone into a board meeting they will consider our briefing among other reports that they may have on whether they will participate or not but that is a decision for the ecb as far as the icc are concerned the safety and security is satisfactory for hosting the tournament in pakistan
5762714 its something i would not be able to tell you at this point
5762715 i wouldnt be able to tell you what would be in the minds of the icc board when it sits to consider such an eventuality it would be great for the best teams to attend and every one of the best players to come
5762716 i think weve got to a position where its very difficult to do it to the position where we could stage a successful world class event
5762717 at this point in time there is no discussion about a late move it is speculative until member boards or teams clearly indicate what their view is as far as we are concerned the tournament continues in pakistan
5762718 every single day our security advisors update themselves and in turn us on the changing political environment in pakistan the advice on the current development is that the status quo remains unchanged if anything it is a step in the right direction and im quoting their words
5762719 this really is a shocking and sickening situation where children were brought to drug deals
5762720 it is a decision we made a while ago and we are going to stick to it
5762721 but in this country spain small sports live on scholarships and in this country scholarships are paid after the fact based on your results it means giving up a very important sum of money
5762722 now i am going to be at the palma de mallorca velodrome working in the field of sports i will retain ties to cycling
5762723 this operation highlights the importance of law enforcement agency relationships both internationally with ceop in the uk and through the virtual global taskforce partners and locally with our state and territory police
5762724 this is not just another successful result in this crime type but it underlines the constant problem police worldwide face in the downloading of child abuse images
5762725 we will continue to relentlessly pursue those individuals who choose to trade access download and publish online child abuse images and child exploitation material and if you are one of those people know that police could be knocking on your door tomorrow
5762726 this is not just a new name for edgar this is a fundamental change in the way the sec collects manages and distributes information
5762727 everybody ignores the policy and finds underground ways of keeping their data anyway
5762728 flies in the face of 10 years of best practices in records management
5762729 to be eligible for the blizzcon ticket drawing you must 1 have an active blizzard account that was created on or before 9 00 p m pdt on tuesday august 12 2008 when we first announced blizzcon 2008 tickets had sold out 2 be an adult in your country of residence 3 have not previously purchased blizzcon 2008 tickets and 4 live in the united states canada australia new zealand singapore france the united kingdom germany austria denmark the netherlands or south korea
5762730 certes il y a la flamb e du p trole et les al as climatiques
5762731 it will actually benefit the middle class the wealthy will have more money to pay everyone else
5762732 i think we came out on offense and executed well
5762733 the offensive line did a nice job blocking and michael smith and dennis johnson had some big runs
5762734 what i like is that he came back later called the exact same play and threw a touchdown
5762735 we still need to work on pass rushing and getting people to the football
5762736 i thought we were a little better defending the run today
5762737 we still have to get all 11 guys on the same page
5762738 because of injuries and how young we are the defense will be a little behind the offense for now
5762739 jerry is doing a nice job and has improved a lot since the spring
5762740 hes gotten better at defending the pass which is where hes really improved
5762741 it provides a look at the cultural touchstones that shape the lives of students entering college it is the creation of beloits keefer professor of the humanities tom mcbride and public affairs director ron nief the list is shared with faculty and with thousands who request it each year as the school year begins as a reminder of the rapidly changing frame of reference for this new generation
5762742 i expect that no one will ever again with any publication insult muslim sanctity the jewel of medina will not have its second edition
5762743 joness agent natasha kern has been shopping the jewel of medina elsewhere publishers in italy spain and hungary plan to publish it and kern has received numerous calls from interested parties

5762746 losing beverly doesnt hurt as much as you might think especially for the short term the hogs who already were losing four of their other top five scorers werent going to the ncaa tournament with the speedy guard the future of the program is just fine thanks to the recruiting job pelphrey and his staff are doing they signed a six man recruiting class that features four prospects ranked among the top 150 and one of the nations top 20 junior college transfers montrell mcdonald the group is ranked no 16 nationally the razorbacks also have commitment from a four star power forward marshawn powell out of the 2009 class add beverley to that mix and in 2009 10 the hogs certainly would have been better but by then theyll have enough talent to contend in the sec and get back to the ncaa tournament without him

5762782 de un movimiento de las clases medias urbanas y rurales
5762783 cu les son los l mites de cualquier poder para fijar impuestos y la prohibici n de fijarse impuestos excesivos
5762784 no creo que este gobierno el de cristina fern ndez resuelva ni la pol tica agropecuaria ni la inflaci n por lo que se ve el principal problema que en realidad tenemos es que estamos en el final de fiesta es decir se terminaron los per odos de gracia de la deuda los vencimientos de la deuda del a o que viene son enormes el gobierno de la argentina tiene cerrado el cr dito externo tiene una pol tica inflacionaria que no resuelve y una deuda atada a la inflaci n que adem s es indexada y es el peor de los lugares
5762785 tiene muy poco plazo el gobierno para hacer un cambio radical de su pol tica econ mica no porque est bien o est mal sino porque no vamos a poder enfrentar diciembre y el a o que viene que es el punto neur lgico
5762786 cuando usted habla de pol ticas o acciones de mediano y largo plazo muchas veces la tildan de apocal ptica por qu cree que sucede eso
5762787 en realidad a m me toc conducir a una liberaci n y a una rep blica en el medio yo dirijo conduzco y me relaciono directamente con el pueblo los dirigentes de la clase pol tica argentina est claro ni entienden lo que digo ni siquiera tienen la cultura necesaria para discriminar lo que es met fora de lo que es misticismo
5762788 lo cierto es que todav a nos queda el ltimo aprendizaje y ese aprendizaje yo no se los puedo evitar porque es fin de fiesta cruzamos el mar rojo en la met fora de la liberaci n de la salida de egipto y estamos en la etapa del becerro por eso crecen tantos dolos por eso el pasado regresa como presente y por eso aunque el kirchnerismo ya no exista lo peor del pasado se muestra como el futuro y muchos se pueden encandilar nadie se preocupe el becerro estalla y despu s s queda la rep blica la ley esta propuesta de tener una argentina distinta pero el n cleo la revoluci n en paz ya se produjo
5762789 es de manual a adi la presidenta de coalici n c vica tomen cualquier libro de historia de c mo se produce el tr nsito del autoritarismo a las rep blicas en el mundo y es por un exceso fiscal que se produce una revuelta de los sectores que pagan impuestos y ponen un l mite el 33 por ciento no es que dicen que no quieren pagar no es una revuelta por el privilegio sino por el l mite
5762790 el sue o de la argentina que es que todos seamos de clase media
5762791 se va a formar un gobierno no que exprese a esas clases medias solamente sino que asuma la deuda social y el compromiso de justicia de llevar a todos los excluidos a los pobres a ser esa clase media
5762792 tenemos una sociedad que quiere libertad que quiere prosperidad y que quiere igualdad y que asume la justicia social diciendo este pa s no va a ser libre mientras todos no sean libres en el sentido de esta libertad y prosperidad nueva

5762803 senator mccain its time to get serious about reducing the nuclear threat
5762804 out of an abundance of respect for both parties we will not allow attack ads of either persuasion to be prominently displayed in our concourses our customers and employees complained and we responded we will not be a party to petty political attacks on either side
5762805 nuclear weapons are scary and thats why we need to pay attention to them
5762806 but to say that the billboard is anti mccain is ludicrous in fact both mccain and obama largely agree with us that we need to rid the world of nuclear weapons these are not attack ads they are a strong reminder to both candidates that this is a very serious issue they need to address northwest airlines is trying to censor free speech and i dont think thats their role
5762807 the cold war ended nearly 20 years ago but the united states and russia still have many thousands of nuclear weapons and each keeps more than a thousand on hair trigger alert ready to be launched within a matter of minutes
5762808 this creates a real risk of an accidental or unauthorized russian launch against one or more american cities we need a public debate about u s nuclear weapons policy and thats why we launched our media campaign

5762827 effectively the changes mean instead of counting instances or processors and licensing by server you are able to count instances or processors and license by server farm
5762828 this change does not apply to software licenses for the windows server operating system client access licenses cals or management licenses mls
5762829 microsoft great move today i think many enterprises will appreciate the application licensing flexibility that your policy change has provided still lets not forget about the small it shops that do not have volume licenses why restrict server os mobility lifting the 90 day licensing transfer restriction across all product lines is simply the right thing to do

5762869 around the globe wind generating capacity has been expanding at a rapid 30 clip in recent years
5762870 and 2008 is already shaping up to be even better
5762871 the companys most promising division is involved in the production of structural wind towers
5762872 led by states such as texas and california wind farms around the country will generate almost 50 billion kilowatt hours of electricity this year of course the u s is still playing catch up with many other regions
5762873 in fact countries such as spain portugal and denmark all rely on wind farms for as much as one quarter of their total power needs
5762874 the outlook is even brighter in many booming energy hungry asian markets in china installed wind power capacity surged 130 last year and will reportedly supply a great deal of the electricity needed for the upcoming 2008 beijing olympic games
5762875 thanks to the great strides in engineering wind turbine output has increased by a factor of ten or higher in some cases over the past decade
5762876 the power generating potential of wind is enormous the wind resources in north dakota alone are enough to power a staggering one third of the countrys total power needs
5762877 it comes as no surprise to hear that 36 billion will be spent on wind generating equipment this year i see trinity as a great way to participate
5762878 trinity is a top supplier of several different industrial product lines including railroad cars highway girders inland cargo barges and propane tanks all of which happen to be doing pretty well at the moment
5762879 however the firm has a large and growing stake in wind towers the company is among a handful of recognized leaders in the market for these giant tubes
5762880 this facet of the firms business is growing rapidly amid heated demand wind tower revenues have spiked 35 fold over the past four years soaring from just 11 million in 2004 to an expected 390 million this year
5762881 better still order backlog over the past 12 months has surged from 200 million to 1 6 billion representing a highly visible stream of future business within the next five years management is forecasting that wind tower revenues could double again to 800 million
5762882 even without energy equipment the firms other business segments alone merit a closer look
5762883 the firms fleet of 41 000 railroad cars available for lease is 99 6 utilized and the average lease has over five years remaining
5762884 these revenues are locked in and will provide some stability regardless of what happen on the product sales side but future orders should remain robust considering 700 000 of the nations 1 6 million railcars are more than 25 years old and the replacement cycle has already begun
5762885 with a balanced mix of old and new trinity reported second quarter earnings that shattered expectations and raised its full year earnings outlook sales and profits in the firms wind tower unit shot up 58 and 117 respectively with all this in mind i will add trn to my deep discount portfolio

5762974 il se peut que les rapports d j difficiles entre la russie les pays de lotan et de lunion europ enne connaissent un refroidissement consid rable allant jusqu une nouvelle guerre froide et une opposition arm e le long de toutes les fronti res

5762983 dans tout lespace de la cei la tension la plus forte demeure entre la russie et la g orgie la probabilit dun nouveau conflit grandit de jour en jour concernant les d penses militaires par rapport au pib la g orgie a d j d pass tous les pays de la zone la plus riche en conflits le proche orient et occupe la deuxi me place dans le monde les armes accumul es doivent forc ment servir quelque chose
5762984 pour la russie le principal objectif poursuivi dans le caucase est dorganiser avec succ s les jeux olympiques 2014 de sotchi etant donn que deux zones de conflit se trouvaient c t du territoire des jo il fallait faire quelque chose il y avait deux variantes ou bien sentendre avec mikha l saakachvili et remettre avec lui de lordre en abkhazie et en oss tie du sud ce quoi n taient probablement pas pr ts certains milieux russes qui font de la contrebande avec leurs coll gues abkhazes et sud oss tes ou bien soumettre tout ce territoire par tous les moyens possibles entre autres en freinant le processus dadh sion de la g orgie lotan et en provoquant lagression de tbilissi

5762988 echaud en g orgie loccident essaiera de prendre sa revanche bien entendu il est peu probable quune guerre sanglante et un g nocide aient lieu en transnistrie comme en oss tie du sud mais les habitants de la transnistrie tiraill s entre lukraine qui a rejoint fermement mikha l saakachvili et la moldavie maligne qui vendra avec plaisir tout ce quelle poss de pour 30 deniers qui les lui proposera seront certainement conditionn s en vue de les amener lentement mais s rement faire un choix en faveur du ma tre occidental
5762989 deux branches du pouvoir existent en russie celle de poutine siloviki repr sentants des structures de force et celle de medvedev lib raux mikha l saakachvili supposait probablement que la dualit du pouvoir en russie lui permettrait de faire facilement revenir loss tie du sud dans le giron g orgien car en renon ant loss tie la branche de medvedev pouvait esp rer obtenir le pouvoir r el laide de la communaut internationale si moscou avait d cid de ne pas senliser dans le mar cage oss te dmitri medvedev aurait pu devenir une personnalit appr ci e de loccident bien quil se f t probablement heurt la r sistance des milieux imp riaux dans son pays c tait pour dmitri medvedev lunique voie vers le pouvoir ouverte par la g orgie mais il ne la pas remarqu e

5762991 lorsque le fascisme vaincra en russie et lorsque cette russie fasciste et brune frappera la porte de leurope alors leurope commencera penser entreprendre des actions nergiques contre la russie mais il sera d j trop tard si la russie devient fasciste il sagira pour le monde entier dun ph nom ne plus dangereux que lallemagne fasciste
5762992 les actions de la russie sont une gifle donn e la communaut internationale civilis e et si cette communaut veut conserver sa dignit elle doit se raviser
5762993 on peut sattendre une d t rioration consid rable de lattitude des pays occidentaux envers la russie en premier lieu des etats unis et dune grande partie des pays deurope de lest les pays de lunion europ enne feront obstruction la russie les rapports entre la russie et plusieurs etats de lespace postsovi tique se compliqueront car ils pourraient leur tour tre victimes dune agression russe

5763030 we also call on parents to monitor their children very closely and get help urgently from clinical experts if their children demonstrate signs and antics of hate including withdrawal from society or family which in the long term results in such incidents of violence
5763031 it is regrettable that on a daily basis learners lose their lives in schools as a result of the barbaric and evil scourge of violence in mainly working class public schools

5763086 won the 250 000 grand prize in the mini series and soon after lost his life

5763089 we have shelters standing by to open when they are needed
5763090 we are staying on alert watching every move of this storm
5763091 worlds everyone is always coughing and im confident its the pollution not the daily sheesas you see them smoking in coffee houses
5763092 we have only the 10 000 baht rooms now the 6 000 baht are full
5763093 cant we just get to where were going im sick of all this traveling around
5763094 heading into the eye of the tsunami so to speak
5763095 a veces me la han pegado hasta de centro izquierda por mi forma de pensar con respecto a la justicia y por no querer dar manija para nada pero voy a acompa ar a partir de hoy a la gente que est haciendo un esfuerzo por el plebiscito a mis compa eros del frente
5763096 la anulaci n de la ley no va a solucionar nada
5763097 no hay ninguna soluci n definitiva con ley o sin ley porque el que tiene la verdad y no la dice va a seguir en la misma y como no lo pod s poner en un cuarto de tortura
5763098 si yo te pido la verdad pero al mismo tiempo te amenazo con que te voy a meter pa adentro no me vas a decir la verdad

5763101 if i stay in bed ill never get to sleep and just lay here all night but if i get up i might miss my opportunity to fall asleep
5763102 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
5763103 i have in the last few months become more pessimistic than the consensus
5763104 im not someone who sees things in a bleak way
5763105 i have more concerns about potential risks and vulnerabilities than most people
5763106 its a mix of skills that rarely comes packaged in one person

5763108 nouriel has a different way of seeing things than most economists he gets into everything
5763109 the most brilliant economist who never wrote down an equation
5763110 were in uncharted territory where standard economic theory isnt helpful
5763111 the justification for his bearish call has evolved over the years
5763112 this forecasting by analogy is a tempting thing to do
5763113 but you have to pick the right analogy the danger of this more subjective approach is that instead of letting the objective facts shape your views you will choose the facts that confirm your existing views
5763114 and youre asking whats the worst thing that could happen the first thing people will say is lets see what nouriel says
5763115 if the underlying conditions call for optimism nouriel would be optimistic
5763116 im not comfortable saying that were going to end up in the great depression
5763117 we are in a recession and denying it is nonsense
5763118 you either nationalize the banks or you nationalize the mortgages
5763119 reckless people have deluded themselves that this was a subprime crisis
5763120 but we have problems with credit card debt student loan debt auto loans commercial real estate loans home equity loans corporate debt and loans that financed leveraged buyouts
5763121 a good third of the regional banks wont make it
5763122 our biggest financiers are china russia and the gulf states

5763128 outside china especially in western countries the violent unrest in tibet has been seen as a people spontaneously rising up after years of religious and cultural oppression by a ruthless ruling party
5763129 we are honored that the national federation of the blind has recognized our website we believe in making a difference in the lives of the blind and those living with visual impairments and we will continue to do all we can to guarantee full accessibility of the independent living aids website
5763130 weve re engineered the common flashlight into a more powerful tool that will help give professionals and do it yourselfers the vision to do their jobs better
5763131 the difference isnt subtle and we named it daylite for a reason its like bringing a beam of daylight to the job its powered by duracell batteries but its another example of how the company is bringing more than battery innovation to the market
5763132 we believe mobile video is going to be as big as video has exploded online and perhaps even bigger given the nature of the handset as a personal device and given the fact that in so many countries like china and india the phone is actually somebodys first screen we are poised in a very interesting market that is going to explode in the next couple of years
5763133 i personally think the u s broadband industry and u s mobile industry need some sort of mindset change which is the hardest to achieve to get away from thinking that new customer acquisition will solve all your problems
5763134 at the end of the day it is the existing customers that provide 80 of the profit but they only get 20 of attention
5763135 and even still they are looking to new customers first service providers will come to realize it is more important to enrich existing customers and upsell them and make sure they are happy than it is to constantly court new customers
5763136 top gear has a massive audience across the globe so we thought it was time it had its own place on youtube
5763137 unsurprisingly none of the winners chose to take the prize money
5763138 when your job security is virtually guaranteed due to outrageous union tenure rules regardless of your performance why would you quit for 10 000
5763139 while many of the winners were teachers who committed reprehensible acts and yet were not fired the majority of the nominations we received were for teachers who simply didnt seem to care about teaching
5763140 the fact is our education system isnt imperiled as much by the rogue teacher who has a sexual relationship with a student that person should simply be in jail as it is by the entrenched mediocrity that is bred by bad union policies such as teacher tenure and the absence of merit pay
5763141 we held this contest to jump start a conversation about the negative impact teachers unions are having on our public education system and to advocate on behalf of good teachers by promoting merit pay and opposing teacher tenure we hope to continue to promote these ideas any way we can
5763142 the zoominfo public api provides free access to zoominfos people database and company database that contain over 40 million people and nearly 4 million companies respectively the zoominfo people data and company data are accessed using a simple rest query api

5763144 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
5763145 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
5763146 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5763147 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5763148 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
5763149 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
5763150 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
5763151 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
5763152 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
5763153 to bear witness to our faith not only in private in our homes but also in our public lives with others in order to bear strong witness to christ
5763154 we want to have the tools in place to say were ready for that

5763159 the empire for many people was the major sense of their existence now its no more
5763160 it was regarded as poor retarded you know just underdeveloped and so on
5763161 now under mr putin russia has finally emerged as a more or less well to do nation but it wanted to have the feeling that now it will be regarded by the other nations differently with more respect
5763162 washington has been neglecting the relationship with russia profoundly over the last eight years
5763163 weve had a situation time and time again when president bush has gone to a summit meeting you know declared his cooperation with his good friend president putin and then hes gone back to washington and nothing has happened
5763164 why for 15 years after the end of cold war west did do very little to make russia an ally and friend
5763165 every russian leader came to power saying reasonable things about the west and sooner or later something happens which will turn them anti american
5763166 i talk to my friends they basically say america is extremely selfish country and doesnt understand that other people may have different ideas different agendas different approaches
5763167 they do not trust that this effort undertaken by the u s in europe is against iran or against terrorist launches
5763168 they still think that this is against russia why what is the reason that instead of inviting both nations to cooperate closely they fight each other on that
5763169 all of them are in a stupor because they dont know what to say they dont want to speak out and support russia but on the other hand they dont want to come out and oppose russia

5763175 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5763176 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant

5763223 its an incredibly dangerous mission that both french and other nato allies are on and what weve seen since 2007 is an increasingly capable taliban insurgency able to hit not just at civilian targets and the reconstruction efforts but also against nato soldiers
5763224 the bigger problem is going to be with the french public
5763225 the mission in afghanistan hasnt received much publicity perhaps deliberately and i think to a large extent the number of deaths were now talking about may spark the debate that has taken place in germany in britain in many other european countries but hasnt really taken place in france yet

5763236 we can make more in mobile than desktop advertisting eventually
5763237 theoretically where google could be most disruptive is by using mobile ad revenue to subsidize the phone or subsidize service and fundamentally altering the industrys economics
5763238 google has a significant consumer brand but that by itself is not enough to sell phones an android phone will still have to compete in the real world against other devices consumers dont buy operating systems they buy devices
5763239 the gymnastics competitions of the beijing olympics were spectacular some of them were so fierce
5763240 i can assure you some gymnastics competitions at the beijing games such as mens team and womens team contests are classics which cannot be seen for a very long time
5763241 we are so proud of our team our four years hard work eventually paid off
5763242 in the past four years we had worked so hard to come from our lowest to the peak
5763243 we adjusted ourselves to the gymnastics new scoring system and new rules
5763244 i dont want my name to appear anywhere in a book with that title
5763245 of course that title is a provocation and a bit hyperbolic
5763246 im a teacher and i know that while teaching often works best by offering encouragement support and understanding sometimes if you really want to serve young people you have to give them a good dose of challenge of provocation of criticism
5763247 i ignore their insults and address their substantive points and they usually end up being very civil
5763248 theyre just taking offence at the title and thats a good thing because it shows they care about intellectual values and want to defend themselves
5763249 young americans today are no more learned or skilful than their predecessors no more knowledgeable fluent up to date or inquisitive except in the materials of youth culture
5763250 touches the core of a young persons mind the mental storehouse from which he draws when engaging the world
5763251 is google making us stoopid what the internet is doing to our brains
5763252 once i was a scuba diver in the sea of words now i zip along the surface like a guy on a jet ski
5763253 the kind of deep reading that a sequence of printed pages promotes is valuable not just for the knowledge we acquire from the authors words but for the intellectual vibrations those words set off within our own minds
5763254 it is clear that users are not reading online in the traditional sense
5763255 indeed there are signs that new forms of reading are emerging as users power browse horizontally through titles contents pages and abstracts going for quick wins it almost seems that they go online to avoid reading in the traditional sense
5763256 has little choice but to play by the new media rules
5763257 pancake people spread wide and thin as we connect with that vast network of information accessed by the mere touch of a button
5763258 i remember an introduction to poetry class in which i told students that their homework was to memorize 20 lines of any poem and to recite it at our next meeting
5763259 well a student at the front immediately asked why should we do that
5763260 she wasnt being impudent or rude she just didnt understand the necessity or value of that kind of assignment after all a poem could always be downloaded you didnt have to carry it in your head
5763261 notice a few things like that and you begin to think that something is really changing
5763262 that study put some empirical evidence behind my impressions and when i looked at other studies i found a lot of agreement
5763263 so my own observations and the empirical study itself were the points of genesis in the book
5763264 the situation marks an important contrast material possessions vs intellectual possessions adolescent skills vs adult skills
5763265 they care so much about the trappings of cool and are so conversant with pop culture but they blink uncomprehendingly at the mention of the reformation the second amendment fellow travellers or fellini
5763266 every major media organ in the united states has covered it and some have done full feature stories
5763267 writing off any generation before its 30 is whats dumb
5763268 a lot of the response is just be nicer to the kids
5763269 i believe a lot of these people are idealistic baby boomers who came of age in the 1960s when the youth movement was in full swing and they still identify in a deep sense with youth but identification is not the best position for debate
5763270 sure you need soft loving teachers who offer support but you also need critical teachers who rebuke the young and point out shortcomings
5763271 theres a phobia of elders criticizing the juniors but thats what elders are supposed to do how else will juniors carry on the cultural heritage how else will they get transmission
5763272 and if it turns out that we have 75 per cent of young people voting in this election then i will be happy to say that my comments about civic apathy were wrong
5763273 but if inspiration proves to be their only motive and their participation falls in later elections when an obama is absent then my initial suspicion will be correct
5763274 we need a diligent citizenry and not merely a momentarily inspired one
5763275 the teachers professors writers journalists intellectuals editors librarians and curators who will not insist upon the value of knowledge and tradition who will not judge cultural novelties by the high standards set by the best of the past who will not stand up to adolescence and announce it is time to put away childish things
5763276 the child will still be online still be connected but at least more mature content will be passing through
5763277 its very hard to influence a generation that is so into itself and is so inclined to model itself horizontally on its own members rather than vertically on teachers mentors and those who preceded them
5763278 fifty years from now i think literature and the fine arts and philosophy and foreign language study will only be serving small cells of people and be completely marginal to a lot of the cultural life of the nation just as university departments of classics so dominant a century ago now serve just tiny numbers
5763279 we gave tube lines notice of our strike action last wednesday and we have heard nothing from the company since
5763280 if terry morgan wants to avoid a strike he should get around the table with us to negotiate a pay and conditions package that our members will find acceptable
5763281 it is no good burying his head in the sand and claiming its all political because that wont make our members grievances go away
5763282 the reality is that tubelines already pays rates lower than metronet and offers inferior pensions and travel facilities and the reason our members voted by a margin of more than three to one to strike is because what is on the table will widen that gap
5763283 if terry morgan doubts that this is an industrial dispute he should try putting some more money and better conditions on the table
5763284 its very tough to focus on it right now with two pilots on my plate

5763298 we never went out during the time we were training
5763299 our school is quite strict when we stay in school we cant go out on our own let alone when were at a military camp

5763301 in one week we could only work four and a half days we had to have coffee breaks twice a day couldnt go into overtime and just a little discomfort was not allowed because of human rights
5763302 you could not criticize them either they all belong to some organizations they have all kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in one month
5763303 at one point the children had to run in four different directions when one fell others quickly followed
5763304 we had only two meals for the entire time there was almost no time to sleep even less time for toilet breaks
5763305 but we didnt feel so angry because the director was also there with us the whole time
5763306 all the tears the sweat and sometimes even blood that we shed i now think it was quite worth it
5763307 when we performed that night all that i could feel in my heart was joy pure joy

5763310 the device was an old type of device that had been used previously in the ira campaign and we believe at this point in time it had probably been stored since then and malfunctioned possibly because it hadnt been stored in very good conditions

5763312 he had experienced some chest pains and hes in for testing

5763314 the forecast calls for it fay to move very slowly possibly into the atlantic again it could strengthen again and come back at florida and maybe even make it into the gulf of mexico
5763315 there are some computer models that call for that so weve got many many many days to watch this
5763316 we do have some bands feeding into the storm from the south
5763317 it will be these bands rotating into the storm and breaking off that could impact the bay area
5763318 we could see some tropical storm conditions from these bands
5763319 why do things always have to turn out this way

5763322 smoking does appear to increase the risk of posttonsillectomy hemorrhage in patients who undergo uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with tonsillectomy but not in those who undergo tonsillectomy alone
5763323 this modifiable risk factor may help clinicians further counsel their patients before surgery but further study is needed to ascertain that these findings apply to a broader patient base
5763324 it has been our anecdotal experience that smokers have a higher rate of postoperative hemorrhage than do nonsmokers
5763325 to evaluate whether smoking is truly a modifiable risk factor we undertook a retrospective review of all patients who underwent tonsillectomy or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty at our center in the past five years
5763326 the reasons for the variation between the tonsillectomy and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty subsets are not known
5763327 the effects of smoking on the rate of postoperative hemorrhage after tonsillectomy and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty

5763331 i like sports cars and i love coffee but i admit i totally dont get why the two seem to get combined so frequently first we had this lamborghini inspired espresso machine and now from brunopasso the pd 1 machine was created with italian sports cars in mind of course there arent many ways a coffee machine can look like a ferrari except of course a shiny red paint job among other choices automobile inspired gauges that form a little mini dashboard and a lever made of beechwood for pressing the coffee

5763362 is not treating the obesity crisis with the seriousness it deserves
5763363 the only thing going down is the money spent to prevent this epidemic
5763364 there needs to be a sense of urgency and outright alarm
5763365 this is the fifth f as in fat report and each year we see more evidence that our nations obesity epidemic continues to gain speed and destructive force
5763366 a strategy alone is insufficient if resources are not placed behind it
5763367 good that means you probably dont have concussion okay mr smith lets have a proper look at you
5763368 well i can put it back in the socket for you but youll have to keep it in a sling for at least a week afterwards in order to let it rest or youll just dislocate it again and that will lead to joint weakness
5763369 im on me own and just arrived in town i cant manage one handed and dont know anyone yet who could help
5763370 then well have to see if we can find you a bed here
5763371 lets get your injuries sorted out first shall we and then we can decide what to do for the best
5763372 right i need to check your leg you were limping quite badly when you approached me
5763373 ill go and see if theres a male doctor free but you may have to wait a little while as you saw were quite busy tonight
5763374 ill cover me lap with me jumper dont want to take up any more of your time
5763375 im here to have my time taken up by patients
5763376 okay ill wait outside call me when youre ready and be careful of that shoulder
5763377 its not broken but it might be fractured or cracked id need an x ray to be positive
5763378 i dont want to hang around for an x ray
5763379 you didnt strike me as the awkward sort when you came in
5763380 clearly im a worse judge of such matters than i realised
5763381 but i really think you should have an x ray if youve got a crack or a fracture in your kneecap it wont do you any good to be walking around on it and could make you lame
5763382 right if you get yourself dressed again ill book an appointment for you for the x ray department tomorrow
5763383 mr smith what are you doing here and how did you find me
5763384 i had things to do stuff needed my urgent attention
5763385 well im all fixed now good as new thanks to you
5763386 tch i dont know thought you were supposed to be clever miss nearly a doctor its wine innit
5763387 to martha jones whos going to be a fantastic doctor one day soon
5763388 one trip and that was it i dont have time for another one of your little jaunts ive been gone too long as it is what with that business with professor chronotis i have obligations these days doctor
5763389 you had obligations then too if memory serves me correctly
5763390 you see that is what becoming president does to you ill bet that you never even have a moment to smell the roses these days
5763391 i never liked being in office myself all that ordering about was very strenuous
5763392 let me see temperate climate yellow sun at least i presume so under all that cloud
5763393 and surprise surprise buttercups if your natural inclination hadnt already made me suspect where we were those would they never grew well off earth
5763394 what that buttercups werent the hardy annuals everyone thought they were
5763395 oh its nothing much really i was just thinking its rather strange were still on earth
5763396 you mean this isnt another one of your accidentally on purpose detours
5763397 seen better days im afraid i havent used it since my last regeneration
5763398 its not as if i havent visited this planet before
5763399 i think we should try and find shelter dont you romana
5763400 i think perhaps i should find a change of clothes first i doubt my present attire will blend in with early nineteenth century conventions
5763401 besides something tells me the occupants will not be the type to care
5763402 doctor dont tell me youve already embroiled these people in one of your little adventures have you
5763403 it still doesnt change the fact that my mode of dress is inappropriate doctor
5763404 its all very well for you your form of dress is at least roughly correct if memory serves me correctly
5763405 k9 stay with the tardis id rather not have to explain you too
5763406 oh come on romana switzerland 1817 a dark and stormy night in a house beside a lake surely it rings a bell
5763407 i took the liberty of checking the coordinates and date while i was looking for the umbrella
5763408 i think you may have mentioned it a time or twelve
5763409 i would have thought youve had your fill of horror and woe in everyday life
5763410 you know its true do you know how many temporal violations youve committed since ive become president
5763411 let me assure you the cia have been keeping very exacting records
5763412 we stopped to stretch our legs and admire the lake view when our horses were spooked by the sudden thunderstorm and ran off wouldnt you say
5763413 well i suppose its a mite better than the usual tall tale you impart
5763414 i am herr schmitt and this is my good friend the lady romana
5763415 where have you been man percy is almost at deaths door
5763416 i dont suppose youre in need of a doctor are you
5763417 could you take care of this for me thank you so much
5763418 this is the lady romana and i am the doctor
5763419 i think i may have taken a chill in the rain
5763420 well why didnt you say so in the first place come in come in how is the old bugger still alive you say i thought he would have popped his clogs years ago
5763421 i mean youre hardly the sort one invites for the weekend no offence doctor
5763422 and hes really not himself mary has had to retire to another room and old polidori has gone out to find a local apothecary he had hoped that it might be some local ailment that he was not familiar with
5763423 i would call this many things but local would not be one of them
5763424 who would have thought wed keep finding traces of this condition after leaving e space
5763425 you know as well as i that it was never truly stamped out not even here
5763426 the one responsible for this is a shadow of the old great ones of course but it can still
5763427 barely but we need to find the root of the infection before this turns into an outbreak
5763428 an outbreak of what dont tell me its the pox
5763429 what youre dealing with here is something a lot more dangerous
5763430 good grief man the next thing you know you will be telling me he has the plague
5763431 what we have here something is something much more insidious and much more dangerous
5763432 but i thought that they were only creatures of a dark imagination
5763433 ill not be sent to bed like some errant schoolchild byron
5763434 percy is my lover i am well within my rights to be here i overheard the servants mention you had found another doctor and i came at once i too would like to know what ails him
5763435 perhaps we could concentrate on the problem at hand please
5763436 we need to find the source of the infection have you had any new acquaintances of late
5763437 since weve arrived ive lost count of the amount of callers weve had
5763438 we dont have enough time to follow up every lead
5763439 and i hardly think that this could occur over an afternoon tea of scones and crumpets
5763440 tell me my lord byron have you had any unusual guests of late
5763441 why yes that description reminds me of visconte di calivari
5763442 you remember byron doctor polidoris friend the one who only calls after dinner
5763443 surely you dont think that a little pallor denotes a vampiric nature mary
5763444 if that were true then half of london society would be guilty of the ailment
5763445 but old polidori has known him for years an old friend of the family he said
5763446 although one much changed from the man he remembered as a youth
5763447 at least that is what john said on the night the viscount first called although he hasnt mentioned that fact since
5763448 yes he was probably pulled into the creatures thrall that night
5763449 tell me has he seemed distracted of late lost in his own thoughts reluctant to pass the salt
5763450 he is much preoccupied of late and not nearly as attentive of my company as he used to be
5763451 one of ruaths creatures must have escaped and is still out there infecting others
5763452 this visconte di calivari he calls often yes every night
5763453 but he has been having problems sleeping since the night the viscount first visited
5763454 tell me is this visconte di calivari due to visit again soon
5763455 well he had been gone for about an hour when you and your doctor friend arrived and that was about twenty minutes ago so
5763456 at least we wont need to use a rocket ship this time
5763457 what matter of fantasia is this you speak of things that are of imagination and artifice and have no anchor in reality whatsoever i am the last person on earth to judge others for a vivid use of their imagination but percys life is at stake here man
5763458 just as were aware that his life is not the only one at stake here look at his neck lord byron do you think that those bite marks are the work of our imaginations
5763459 you mean other than us and doctor polidori well theres claire i suppose
5763460 she will insist on trailing after me despite her present state
5763461 yes well it might be best if you tell your servants to retire early this evening and lock their doors
5763462 and perhaps you should ask miss clairmont to join us in the drawing room
5763463 she said she hadnt been sleeping well the last couple of nights and oh dear
5763464 i had thought it was because of the pregnancy but these new events cast a new light upon it
5763465 it may be that percy is not the only one whose been infected by a vampires bite lead the way
5763466 but please call me mary such strictures are hardly apt in these present circumstances
5763467 and while you two are tending poor claire i shall guide the lady romana to the drawing room
5763468 im afraid the lady romana shall be needed at my side
5763469 were rarely seen apart one without the other whenever theres a vampire about its our curse it seems
5763470 i shall go and urge the servants to retire at once
5763471 perhaps i should also acquire a weapon for this confrontation tell me is there any truth to those tales of a vampires aversion to the essence of garlic
5763472 although ive found fire and a stake through the heart works wonderfully well
5763473 ive no doubt they shall prove useful for our task
5763474 tell me did you ever give much credence to the old myths that said vampires could fly
5763475 well we know of course that with the right psychic preparation such a thing is possible and the old great vampires
5763476 just like old times at least we can cross one myth off the list however
5763477 nothing like a bit of empirical evidence to start off an evening of peril
5763478 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
5763479 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5763480 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5763481 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
5763482 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5763483 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5763484 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5763485 i mean i love her really theres no one in the universe quite so wonderful as aunt lavinia but i told her a million times i dont want a big production today
5763486 you dont turn 30 years old every day you know and you are her only blood relative
5763487 i know that harry which is why i gritted my teeth and agreed to the visit this weekend dinner party saturday night with a gaggle of her university colleagues while she regales them with a list of my accomplishments and their spouses try to hook me up with deadbeat sons still living in the basement
5763488 the worst thing is aunt lavinia hates that sort of thing as much as i do so why on earth would she agree to it
5763489 never did quite get over the fact that lavinia wouldnt marry so now they want their claws in me
5763490 or maybe its just a good excuse to have a party
5763491 you know how it is a coworkers niece is having a birthday what a great excuse to break the diet
5763492 you do have a point oh i suppose it wont be so bad and itll give me some time with lavinia i do adore her
5763493 besides she sent me practically two months worth of rent as a birthday gift
5763494 generous to a fault that lavinia smith and yes i will have a wonderful time at that dinner if it kills me
5763495 i wasnt joking when i told her i wanted to keep things simple this year
5763496 financial gifts are appreciated but not expected not even from my aunt
5763497 i hate birthday parties all that smiling and laughing and oh you cant possibly be that old lying
5763498 at least you understand harry thank you so much for respecting my wishes a lovely dinner out maybe a bottle of wine with a good mate thats all i want
5763499 i erm just have to stop off at u n i t hq before we go paperwork
5763500 oh its late on a friday evening old girl the place will be deserted
5763501 think of it all those offices filled with classified files no one is watching
5763502 seriously harry lets blow off the reservation order a pizza and have my birthday dinner here
5763503 ten to one the brig stashes smutty magazines in his office lets go find them
5763504 come on wheres your sense of adventure twenty pounds says we find hookah pipes and swedish nudist magazines in the bottom drawer whats your call
5763505 the place is deserted harry what are you so nervous about
5763506 im sure your virtue is safe with me dr sullivan
5763507 why do i get the feeling you had something to do with this brigadier
5763508 all of us here consider you an honorary member of u n i t even if you
5763509 not at all miss smith although our positions do make some things a bit more challenging from a defense standpoint
5763510 hes afraid youll find his secret plans for world domination
5763511 oh please thats not the sort of thing i care about i want to know about the brigadiers sordid personal life the drugs and discos and all those
5763512 she seems to be having a good time doesnt she
5763513 i said yes senator price i do have my green card and no you cannot borrow my lipstick
5763514 got the story kept my job and the bastard lost his re election bid
5763515 there were all these famous people i didnt really know obscene amounts of drugs
5763516 im told theres this back room where they take the really big stars for you know
5763517 special parties not that a little nobody like me got stoned with the likes of mick and liza no i just stayed out on the dance floor with the rest of the half dressed hedonists
5763518 i noticed you were getting low and might want another
5763519 erm no it was the other bartender the lady at the other end of the bar
5763520 well cliff was pretty adamant about my not having our baby in the wilds of the amazon basin so he took a fellowship with kings college for a year im sorry i missed the big surprise sweetheart
5763521 i framed a copy of the article you did on cliffs work it was amazing i cant thank you enough
5763522 i cannot begin to tell you how happy i am to see you
5763523 i do believe i would have lost my mind if one more person had grabbed me to tell me how wonderful i look
5763524 its not what theyre saying josephine jones its what theyre not saying you look wonderful for a thirty year old you look smashing for a woman your age ugh
5763525 oh you poor thing turning thirty was hard for me too
5763526 say no more please i got enough of that too nice girl like you should think of starting a family doubt it thank you
5763527 oh i slipped the bartender a ten pound note to make my martinis out of water all night
5763528 well im enjoying the hell out of making harry and the brig squirm
5763529 and the drunker i appear to be the more superficial the conversation fewer people offering advice making suggestions its all tall tales and flirting
5763530 long enough to know that youve more than tormented poor harry sullivan if thats what youre going for he looks so jealous he can barely muster an at ease course if you keep it up the brig may put the whole place in lock down in order to assure that you get safely home
5763531 and im not trying to make anybody jealous harry and i are friends thats all
5763532 although i would have expected a friend to close the bar on an obviously drunken friend at least an hour ago really i thought harry was more responsible than that who knows what kind of trouble i could get in to
5763533 all i wanted was a little italian dinner and maybe some wine is that so much to ask for my birthday
5763534 you really have to have lunch with me so we can catch up properly
5763535 im so glad youre back where you belong and that well things have sorted themselves out for you
5763536 you were a big help sarah and im happy to return the favor how far do you want me to go
5763537 well personally i wouldnt slap you if you tried to cop a feel but remember harry doesnt know were setting him up he might get you know protective
5763538 do not turn my vengeance into some petty army navy thing mike yates
5763539 shes had so much to drink and well you know how it can be turning thirty
5763540 im afraid she may have had a few too many tonight
5763541 well i know that on my thirtieth birthday i didnt care about anything i just wanted to throw caution to the wind to be wild and outrageous to do all sorts of things id regret in the morning
5763542 spoil sport youre no fun at all since you lost the sideburns old man
5763543 no harm sullivan sj and i were just having a bit of fun
5763544 mike wants to show me a good time on my big day
5763545 dont be difficult harry im sure mike would never take advantage of sarah jane
5763546 no i think it would be best if i took sarah home now
5763547 please give our regrets to the brig will you mrs jones
5763548 harry i want to drive its my birthday and you have to give me everything i want on my birthday and i want to drive

5763551 now see here sarah youre not driving tonight you are drunk and embarrassingly so i will not stand idly by while you put your life at risk
5763552 what a clich poor sarah so depressed at turning the big three oh she gets smashed at her surprise party and starts throwing herself at everything in trousers
5763553 im sorry about the party and im sorry about well im not sure exactly what im sorry about but believe me when i say im really sorry
5763554 i just didnt want a big fuss you knew that
5763555 but the brig bullied you into it and instead of warning me you just
5763556 have i suffered enough or am i going to have to get used to being the butt of your jokes
5763557 two things first you get me that italian dinner ive been craving we can do take away and bring it back to my flat
5763558 promise me youll never make me drink anything even resembling a martini again
5763559 dont judge the accommodations mister ship shape my flat is perfect for me and if you didnt like it we could have gone to your place
5763560 ristorante di paese is strictly for the turisti harry my friend owners a friend of the publisher over at the telegraph and well you know how those things are
5763561 now i know a pizza joint near the scalinata della trinit dei monti in rome that would kick your arse
5763562 hey my aunt paid for the education why should i hide it
5763563 now this is the birthday i wanted great food good company quiet surroundings
5763564 thank you harry you really were a good sport about tonight
5763565 did you really slap a u s senator in the ladies room at studio 54
5763566 although i added in the part about the lipstick purely for spite
5763567 youre just never going to be content with a normal life are you sarah jane
5763568 no im never going to settle down and be anyones wife or mum
5763569 my life is what it is harry but im glad i have friends to share it with and a career that keeps me happy

5763582 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever
5763583 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
5763584 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
5763585 four years ago we had a large failure and we blamed ourselves
5763586 i would never trade one of my silvers for gold
5763587 what i went through to get them is very special to me and really touched my heart
5763588 she came in with the possibility of winning a few gold medals and that hasnt happened we were running out of chances
5763589 i knew it wasnt quite my best routine but i knew it was enough for a medal but im really happy for shawn three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
5763590 thats the great ending she was a little bit disappointed after the all around but she went all the way to the end i can appreciate that
5763591 to finally have a gold and be an olympic gold medalist its what everyone dreams of
5763592 i hit the floor and i looked at mark and said can you believe that just happened

5763666 weve sought to acknowledge and to reconcile historic grievances like for example what we did in june with the apology on the tragedy of indian residential schools and you know friends as tough as that was for the country did it not feel good to have our aboriginal leaders tell canadians in the house of commons how proud they are to be canadian
5763667 so friends i believe that this is our great talent as a party the other party has taken grievances and divisions and has built them into voting blocks but we as conservatives have taken them and built them into a country

5763677 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
5763678 red might have a similar effect in humans that it has in the wild with primates
5763679 so in certain primates red is a dominance or superiority cue
5763680 the one thats dominant or larger will through a testosterone surge show red on its chest or face
5763681 and thats a cue that the other ape should avoid that ape because its more powerful
5763682 wearing a red uniform could have a positive effect on your teams performance because your opponents are looking at the red that youre wearing
5763683 i do not think that china has an unfair advantage in the olympics and i do not believe that there is a general positive effect for red
5763684 our results points to the referees in combat sport in which two athletes are involved and our experiment is a comparison of red versus blue and therefore the effect is between these two colors if red versus for example black produces the same difference is not clear

5763717 by prohibiting mandatory overtime new york states hospitals and health care facilities will be able to provide a greater quality of care to its patients
5763718 additionally this legislation will allow our facilities to retain and recruit a vital nursing workforce which is necessary to maintain the high standard of health care that new york provides
5763719 we have fought for this legislation for more than eight years our members across the state have told us that employer mandated overtime is endangering their patients and their own health this is a landmark measure for both patients and nurses
5763720 limiting mandatory overtime has always been about workplace fairness safety and the well being of nurses and the patients they treat this legislation will ensure that patients are no longer cared for by overworked nurses and it will allow these dedicated professionals to perform to the best of their ability we are thankful for governor patersons active role on this most important issue and we are grateful to the senate and assembly for working together and agreeing on this vital legislation
5763721 all new yorkers owe a debt of gratitude to the members of the pba for everything they do to serve the state and protect its residents
5763722 i am pleased that we now have a settlement it will allow these union members to continue to provide new york state with the dedicated and selfless service they have always given
5763723 this is a very fair contract and we are pleased with it we appreciate the fact that governor paterson balanced the fiscal needs of the state with the recognition of the difficult and dangerous jobs troopers perform for state residents each and every day

5763732 this help is badly needed it has been a challenging year for new yorks farmers who are the backbone of our upstate new york economy
5763733 i am pleased that the usda has acknowledged our need for assistance during this difficult growing season providing our farmers with the opportunity to apply for emergency loans if we can help our farmers withstand the financial hardships associated with these difficult weather conditions we can help preserve upstate new yorks important agricultural future
5763734 this is great news for new york farmers who suffered the brunt of the hail storm this past summer this federal aid will go a long way towards giving new yorks farmers the assistance they need after this devastating storm this assistance from usda is essential for farmers to cover their losses and to help rebuild farmland just last week i was in wayne county to talk with farmers and growers about the losses they have experienced because of the hail storm and i know how much this assistance is needed i want to thank my colleagues governor paterson senator clinton and all local officials for coming together to get this done
5763735 this is welcome news for new yorks hardworking farmers who are still struggling to recover from the devastating effects of the june storms i am glad to see that the usda has responded to our call and issued this disaster declaration so our farmers will not have to stand alone in shouldering the burden of recovering from this disaster i will continue to work hard to ensure our farmers have the resources they need to get back on their feet and i strongly urge anybody who thinks they may be eligible for assistance from the usda to visit their local fsa office as soon as possible
5763736 i thank governor paterson and the usda for their diligence in getting the assistance our farmers need during this difficult growing season while crops are still abundant in the fields hail storms have repeatedly damaged fruits and vegetables this season leaving them scarred with pit marks and unmarketable for the fresh market while the entire crop was not lost any loss of fresh market produce severely hurts the bottom line of farmers
5763737 the hailstorms this summer have been unprecedented in scope and we need all the help we can get to help our farmers recover the rallying of our leaders in albany and washington helped make this declaration come quickly our industry is grateful

5763890 in 1994 ben ik met mijn vader ratu noa nawalowalo naar de fiji eilanden geweest ik zal nooit vergeten hoe ik in de golven stond en de harmonieuze zang hoorde van de vrouwen die naar de riffen waadden om te gaan vissen op de melodie van een hymne riepen ze elkaar vanaf een afstand toe het geluid van hun stemmen vermengde zich met het geluid van het water hier in het water kwamen de vele dimensies van deze vrouwen tot uiting de gaven van kracht sensualiteit en vitaliteit van de vrouwen waren tegelijkertijd die van het water zelf in de bewegingen van het water zag ik de rimpelingen van dansende vrouwen ik wist dat ik hier eens een voorstelling over zou maken

5763902 the already severe shortage of rental stock is likely to get a lot worse and that will be bad for renters
5763903 rates went too far and the reserve is now trying to reverse them
5763904 they are now becoming more concerned that we might have a recession
5763905 less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5763906 we think there could be three cuts in a row
5763907 household net worth had declined by almost 5 per cent over the first half of 2008
5763908 in effect reserve bank board members believed that monetary policy had become so tight there was the risk of serious damage to the economy

5763910 when i started my national team adventure four years ago there was a team and a group to build from nothing
5763911 we achieved this and today we are starting again from there
5763912 this is a team of moral and technical quality that can still give a lot
5763913 ii whilst some props may be harbouring fat that is a necessity for the position

5763915 ti ricordi quando mi hai chiesto se avevo le pastiglie per la felicit la pastiglia la vita vivi buttati apriti ascoltati le tue paure le tue ansie sono dovute al fatto che tu esisti ma non vivi sei castrato nei sentimenti sei bloccato ti ricordi quella frase di oscar wilde diceva che vivere la cosa pi rara al mondo la maggior parte della gente esiste e nulla pi

5763918 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
5763919 it has been shown that in a pregnant woman msg will cross through the placenta and can affect the fetus
5763920 fetuses are still developing and their brain cells are starting to grow and starting to reach out to each other if msg has been inhibiting or stunting the growth then the cells basically wont reach out to one another
5763921 theres no difference between a snail brain cell and a rat or a human brain cell only that there are fewer of them and theyre larger
5763922 this is the first unequivocal evidence to my knowledge that msg has direct effect on neuronal ability i think its very exciting
5763923 its very important especially for pregnant women or people getting into their elder ages to be aware of how much msg youre consuming
5763924 the stuff she has done in six weeks i would call it equivalent to a masters degree
5763925 the only thing i hope is that i never have to compete with this young mind its absolutely incredible
5763926 offer no prevention plan it is clear where they are coming from abstinence programs are ineffective prevention programs must be evidence based which is code language for programs that promote abstinence need not apply
5763927 prime example of what has gone very wrong when it comes to preventing hiv aids
5763928 encourage and support youths in their decision to abstain from sex have been evicted from d c public schools
5763929 effective hiv aids prevention strategy can be devised as long as d c politicians and school officials
5763930 policies that look at what is best for all d c children and families
5763931 rather than wait for health care reform as efforts lurch forward and back some consumers could benefit by taking a second look at individual policies
5763932 there is definitely more competition more players entering into the market and more products available than ever before
5763933 we are in a mature insurance market and some of the biggest potential is in the individual market
5763934 it may be better but its so bad that theyve got a long way to go before it gets to what we have in the small group market

5763947 is there any reason you couldnt get excited about that
5763948 and it brought real tears to my eyes raisin for your most thoughtful heads up for a former i personality to revel in it at least once more

5763961 it is what our security advisors describe as a presidential level of security what would be rolled out for any head of state that is visiting the country that is the extent of the measure we have in place
5763962 at this moment in time there is no discussion about a late move until members boards or participating teams clearly indicate their view as far as we are concerned the tournament will progress in pakistan
5763963 the tournament is going ahead the teams have not withdrawn and we expect the best teams to participate
5763964 will take them into account when they make the big decision
5763965 its a concern that we havent yet had confirmation from all eight countries that they are prepared to go to pakistan
5763966 the scheduled start time for the tournament is perilously close so of course i am concerned
5763967 ii whilst some props may be harbouring fat that is a necessity for the position
5763968 medical practitioner will tell you these blokes have a mass body index of fat that doesnt match their height
5763969 i dont know what im going to do ill have at least a year off and go knitting
5763970 if there was some wind there id think about it but i would never race in qingdao again
5763971 the wind is so ridiculously light its just not sailing here
5763972 only a half to a third of the medication was actually absorbed
5763973 the best thing would be to take your medication with water two hours before consuming fruit juices to prevent or reduce the chance of this drug interaction
5763974 i think that this is the tip of the iceberg
5763975 i think that there may be many other types of foods that could also possibly cause an interaction
5763976 whenever there were visitors we were made to get up one hour earlier and make everything shine and neat like in a hospital
5763977 we would work very hard but when there were visitors we were forced to stop and we were taken to a kind of playground or recreation room and we were forced to play cards or play basketball to show to the visitors
5763978 as soon as the visitors were gone we were taken back to our dormitories and back to our work again
5763979 everybody knows you are not supposed to talk to anyone visiting because after they have gone you will bear all the consequences
5763980 that is the reason why they have taken all these falun gong practitioners away
5763981 only falun gong practitioners have the courage to tell the truth so they have to make sure all the
5763982 i actually saw many falun gong practitioners driven into insanity or madness so i was not surprised to see
5763983 the torture was too much and it has passed their limitations of endurance i have observed that they have a kind of special mental problem after that
5763984 in february 2001 nearly 1000 illegally detained falun gong practitioners were forced to make 100 000 toy rabbits for beijing mickey toys co ltd subcontracted by nestle at the xinan labor camp falun gong practitioner ms jennifer zeng was detained there for 12 months
5763985 the phenomenon of thousands of people moving together in huge blocks like a machine operated by one person to serve one purpose is a phenomenon that history has proven to be associated with regimes we would rather forget ever existed
5763986 opposite the giant stages speer positioned huge blocks of people dressed in brown and black uniforms who together formed an impressive geometric shape the spirit of the generation which was disturbed by the anarchy and disorder couldnt but watch the scene in great awe
5763987 the visitors in nuremberg including many foreigners were so impressed they were ready to disregard the repulsive aspects of the regime
5763988 if this was about a small country like andorra then that wouldnt have been a reason for concern but this is china a country that accounts for a fifth of the worlds population and has enormous power and natural resources it has the ability to bring into action the ideas that lie behind those ceremonies ideas of imperialism intervention and oppression

5763990 i think you just have those games where you feel like youre hitting the ball well
5763991 at the moment i feel like im striking the ball as good as i have ever have
5763992 stats are irrelevant the biggest thing is if the teams going well then im happy
5763993 its just one of the jobs and its something that i look forward to
5763994 i havent changed a real lot maybe i just had easier shots thats all it was theyve just been closer to the posts
5763995 if you can strike while the iron is hot if you can take advantage of field position and pressure and momentum then the game does have a fair amount of chemistry to it
5763996 no not psychological i dont think it is at all
5763997 i think the tri nations shows how tough it is to win away from home obviously south africa did it in new zealand which was a huge effort
5763998 its just the way this competition is your home games are the ones that you really want to win and you really have to win
5763999 its not something that weve spoken about too much i suppose the history its more just this year
5764000 weve been given our opportunities now weve got two games over here so wed like to win both of them
5764001 whether the springboks won or lost wed still go into the game with a bit of confidence
5764002 weve got a lot of confidence within our group and within the players that weve got here so it doesnt matter which side were playing against or the results that have happened previously
5764003 we know this games going to be a tough game against the springboks were not taking it lightly but within our squad were confident in our own abilities

5764012 wir haben haupts chlich am setup gearbeitet um eine bessere balance zu finden am wochenende hatten wir gerade einmal zwei stunden um das motorrad kennen zu lernen also haben wir heute vormittag einige verschiedene l sungen am heck ausprobiert und sobald wir mit dem basis setup zufrieden waren haben wir einige reifen getestet und uns f r den besten weg entschieden
5764013 wir haben uns im vergleich zum rennen stark verbessert trotzdem d rfen wir nicht vergessen dass wir noch weit weg sind wir d rfen nicht aufgeben

5764021 its still our students and were trying to make sure they dont go down
5764022 people have just said since this was cancelled everyone will still go
5764023 there is still a group organising it who knows who it is
5764024 if students want to put their future careers at risk by indulging in something like this then thats their choice
5764025 if they conduct themselves in a way that is unlawful then the police are ready
5764026 we deplore any anti social and illegal behaviour and would like to remind students of the consequences this can have in their personal and professional lives
5764027 whatever the situation the safety and wellbeing of students and staff are paramount
5764028 we are just focusing on completing the programme tonight then we are going to sit down as a team and discuss how we can best recognise the effort of wes gough
5764029 health care reform is a divisive issue in washington but there is wide agreement on one solution to lower costs and improve care
5764030 obviously the benefits of health it go far beyond patient convenience
5764031 something as simple as another doctors illegible handwriting or an improperly transcribed note can cause a patient to get less than ideal care
5764032 balance is required between protecting patient privacy and giving health care professionals access to patient medical information

5764034 increased efficiency in treatment made possible by health it will also help contain rising health care costs
5764035 a major concern for business owners like me who offer health care coverage
5764036 manufacturers who provide health coverage spend an average of 2 38 per worker per hour on health care costs
5764037 spiraling health care costs have forced many manufacturers to tighten their budgets making it difficult or impossible to expand
5764038 if congress doesnt act to rein in these costs american companies will be forced to either scale back on health benefits or shift manufacturing jobs overseas in order to compete
5764039 offer no prevention plan it is clear where they are coming from abstinence programs are ineffective prevention programs must be evidence based which is code language for programs that
5764040 prime example of what has gone very wrong when it comes to preventing hiv aids
5764041 encourage and support youths in their decision to abstain from sex have been evicted from d c public schools
5764042 effective hiv aids prevention strategy can be devised as long as d c politicians and school officials
5764043 policies that look at what is best for all d c children and families
5764044 rather than wait for health care reform as efforts lurch forward and back some consumers could benefit by taking a second look at individual policies
5764045 there is definitely more competition more players entering into the market and more products available than ever before
5764046 we are in a mature insurance market and some of the biggest potential is in the individual market
5764047 it may be better but its so bad that theyve got a long way to go before it gets to what we have in the small group market
5764048 at the end we want each country to send a report of the number of enterprises they have reached in order for us to develop a database
5764049 in terms of programs jamaica has gone very far ahead as they not only have a workplace policy but have also developed material from which we are borrowing to share with other countries

5764069 i am very very concerned for people who have a disability and that we will have something coming into the house which is not reliable

5764083 i feel she stirs things up within the house rachel has been really awkward with me she has been unusual maybe its we just clash things doesnt ring right with rachel big brother she avoids eye contact with me and shell look away really quick
5764084 is quite negative about her experience in the big brother house when youve been here and been through some of the things weve been through it would be a better atmosphere without nicole how hard i find that
5764085 at the deep root of nicoles personality i think she is quite selfish i think she likes everyone running about after her
5764086 i genuinely think she is a nice person but you do still have to express your opinions
5764087 he is a nice guy but i wouldnt notice the difference if he wasnt here he just sort of farts makes people laugh about that sleeps and eats all the food

5764091 have changed their minds dropping drm requirements for the on demand streaming music services this should put an end to legislation to mandate drm on noninteractive webcasters
5764092 choking off web radio by imposing discriminatory and disproportionate fees is just about the last thing the music industry needs webcasters like pandora are far more effective at exposing listeners to new music than the playlist choked wasteland of commercial fm and am so of course we should tax them to extinction ensuring record labels and musicians a one time profit followed by years of much poorer exposure for new musicians
5764093 its one thing for the crb to lose its collective mind its another for businesspeople who ought to know the market to start sawing their own feet off

5764100 we never went out during the time we were training
5764101 our school is quite strict when we stay in school we cant go out on our own let alone when were at a military camp
5764102 north korea is no 1 in the world when it comes to uniformity they are uniform beyond belief these kind of traditional synchronized movements result in a sense of beauty we chinese are able to achieve this as well though hard training and strict discipline
5764103 in one week we could only work four and a half days we had to have coffee breaks twice a day couldnt go into overtime and just a little discomfort was not allowed because of human rights
5764104 you could not criticize them either they all belong to some organizations they have all kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in one month
5764105 at one point the children had to run in four different directions when one fell others quickly followed
5764106 we had only two meals for the entire time there was almost no time to sleep even less time for toilet breaks
5764107 but we didnt feel so angry because the director was also there with us the whole time
5764108 the change may mean more assessments of the situation but time is running out to stage the event or move it elsewhere
5764109 yes i have resigned from the post and it is now the prerogative of the new president of the country to appoint a new chairman of the pakistan cricket board pcb
5764110 i will continue to work until a new chairman is appointed and i dont see my leaving affecting the champions trophy because pcb is an institution and institutions are not run by individuals
5764111 will take them into account when they make the big decision
5764112 we havent seen the start of the rural economy yet the reality is dairy farmers are only just starting to get the money in their pockets now
5764113 that often takes a couple of years for that to flow through to towns and cities and id expect that to be the case
5764114 its heavy exposure to the troubled red meat industry was now looking at gradual improvement in returns
5764115 it is looking good and the kiwi dollar is coming down as well youd have to say this is probably the best position pggw has been in for some time looking forward
5764116 frankly what is going on in southland despite some commentators beliefs is you are seeing the sun go down on a sheep industry as farmers vote with their feet
5764117 new zealand is proving to be a tougher market to crack than i had anticipated at the get go
5764118 i dont think this case necessarily lends itself to that conclusion
5764119 its not uncommon for players to try to exit a contract part way through their deal and for them to have to pay a sum of money but that case williams is high profile and unusual
5764120 ill take a stab and say that youd get two or three of these cases a year that we would deal with in those cases wed say look guys the player wants to move on and whats it going to take to make that happen
5764121 our view is that you should always try and work through these things amicably sure you can try and walk out on your contract but you run the risk of lawsuits and not everyone has the same financial backing to challenge those as toulon appear to have
5764122 theyve got a salary cap over there for a start and even without a salary cap they couldnt be paying that kind of compensation
5764123 obviously toulon seem to have that luxury of a reasonably endless supply of funds but im just judging that from the outside
5764124 i can see some players looking at this and saying i want to get out of my contract and thats a path i could try
5764125 put it this way we wouldnt be advising any player that we represent to go about things that way
5764126 weve got two halfbacks with us and theres other players as well with us this time whove played in that position before the likes of matt giteau
5764127 i think in the first instance it probably wouldnt be a surprise to you that well look to experience
5764128 so im giving you an insight there that we dont normally do ive broken protocol there
5764129 experience is valuable but it comes down to how you use that
5764130 what previous experience in these sort of contests gives you is an insight but if you then dont use that to your best advantage then its not much value
5764131 they ran today and reported no ill effects on that so we just have to see how they go see how they respond to that work in particular tomorrow and just push on and take it as it comes
5764132 well consider our selection and that will pertain to the springboks
5764133 well look at what we believe will serve us best we havent made those decisions yet believe it or not so well have those discussions and well settle on a combination
5764134 the reality is you can only live in the moment and you can only deal with the challenges that youre presented with at any given point in time and weve got an opportunity coming this weekend and we are not thinking beyond that

5764155 of course this will put more pressure and there will be some doubts about me as the coach and the team but i have faith in my work and in my players
5764156 we will evaluate this defeat and look into the problem areas and we will study everything this is what happens in football sometimes you win sometimes you lose but the most important thing is we have to put our heart into it

5764169 the main thing for england is you need players who can play under pressure and do it under the spotlight because you know there is a lot of criticism waiting from the public
5764170 youve got to deal with that that is the hardest obstacle we are going to get over as a team playing under that intense pressure
5764171 some players can do it better than others that is just how it is we need england to get over that psychological barrier
5764172 its a process we might not go out there on wednesday and win 6 0 and have everyone saying we can be world champions we have to be realistic and build on our confidence
5764173 playing for chelsea and playing for england are two completely different things international football is different
5764174 i wouldnt say any one player lacks confidence we need to improve our mentality as a team
5764175 we are doing that were not burying our heads in the sand
5764176 its pigeon steps the world cup isnt for two years we need to improve slowly so when we get there we are better physically mentally and technically
5764177 we are doing things to improve we need to go out there and be free results help that

5764231 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
5764232 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me
5764233 this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5764234 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5764235 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
5764236 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table

5764241 ive watched this woman survive both those things so for me there was always that sense that i was going to be ok no matter what

5764287 i have breastfed kobi at the station and i have even expressed during district management meetings with my back turned in a room full of men so i did not miss any information
5764288 the men were great it has meant i could remain in top management and be a working mum 11 weeks after giving birth and not miss out on anything

5764369 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
5764370 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5764371 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5764372 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5764373 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
5764374 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
5764375 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
5764376 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
5764377 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
5764378 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
5764379 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

5764389 he did bad things but he wasnt convicted of a crime and he has lived a repentant life for 15 years
5764390 i dont think everyone will have the expectation that it will achieve those kind of levels because the market is very different now
5764391 its a pretty short timeframe so im not expecting it to have a big impact but theyre trying like everyone else to clear the 08s off the lot
5764392 but also because of higher gas prices and because the labor market is not as strong as it was 3 years ago theres not a lot of dry powder left

5764422 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5764423 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5764424 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5764425 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5764426 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5764427 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5764428 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up

5764431 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
5764432 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
5764433 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank

5764436 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5764437 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5764438 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

5764448 on the economic level if travel and trade with the us were normalized it would boost the cuban economy
5764449 but then on the other hand the cuban governments number one preoccupation has been to maintain control over the island and that is much easier within the context of the us embargo
5764450 cuba prefers to deal with countries that shares its ideology or at least respects it
5764451 the ideological rationale for close relations with cuba ended with the demise of the soviet union of course and there has been little interest in moscow in reviving the relationship until now
5764452 however moscow is keen to support the idea of a sovereign cuba which does not fall wholly under a us sphere of interest
5764453 cuba has no strategic value to a post soviet russia which is a regional great power but no longer a global superpower and furthermore it runs counter to moscows attempt to play a constructive role in international relations

5764565 the research enterprise has gone global and the federal government needs to make its investments really count
5764566 one way for the government to increase the value of research is to participate in consortia with industry to plan fund and manage research that is relevant to industry
5764567 the semiconductor roadmap provides a proven model with which an industry can efficiently drive collaboration among its members who otherwise are competitors in the marketplace
5764568 one of the lessons weve learned is that when government participation is strategically added to the team the results can net an unprecedented amount of progress for science and technology and ultimately for the economy
5764569 the federal research enterprise once could afford some inefficiency because we as a nation were so far ahead of the rest of the world today outstanding research is taking place and being funded in countries around the globe
5764570 so the federal government must improve both efficiency and effectiveness of its research programs the consortia model when done well allows research to be appropriately focused enhances technology transfer and attracts high caliber students to study and work in science and engineering
5764571 a well designed research consortium requires commitment from government industry and universities and on balance is a win win win each partner gets more value from its contribution than it would by investing the same resources individually in particular consortia based research helps the federal government achieve its broad research goals of advancing knowledge addressing government science and technology needs improving education and strengthening the economy

5764657 on the surface there appears to be a disconnect between the higher port shipments and lower subscriber additions
5764658 but further analysis indicates that much of the growth was driven by shipments to china where the government mandated limited network growth in the third quarter due to the olympics this resulted in 50 percent higher sequential port shipments to china in the second quarter where advanced buying occurred we believe a correction is likely in the second half of the year driven by limited shipments to china in the third quarter and lower demand in established regions resulting from slowing subscriber additions

5764682 mike sory an all conference player came out of tulsa and was visiting as a recruit
5764683 and we took him into the bowl to look around he played big time oklahoma football
5764684 i was scared to death he was going to look at this and turn up his nose but his dad says this is the way college football ought to be the fans are right on top of it and can sit on the grass and enjoy things
5764685 the bowl has always been unique but to see it like this takes your breath away
5764686 i came down here and it got me all excited for football
5764687 i looked at it and it was like lets go lets play
5764688 to see it and to be practicing here were just so excited and thankful for all the people who made this happen
5764689 we went into the bowl 1967 before it was ready
5764690 we werent thinking of a turf field or anything like that but we never did finish the bowl
5764691 as ive watched this develop over the summer it has been almost overwhelming to me that the college has made this kind of commitment to the athletic program

5764702 ive swam with guys who were in the olympics and it was tough to stay with them and hes just killing them in every race its really incredible
5764703 the biggest thing to take away is his intesity and his focus in each race
5764704 then you look at his turns and he has the best turns in the world thats what helped him win its all the small things he does
5764705 honestly right now the record is important but it s more important for me to do what i have to do to keep going i am not a quitter

5764875 if the milf as a whole has really no hand in these treacherous attacks then i challenge them to surrender their ground leaders specifically bravo and umbra kato as a sign of good faith
5764876 if it is true that the milf leadership did not issue the order to attack the milf elements who pillaged some villages in lanao del norte should be pursued by the milf in coordination with government security forces they should not allow their rogue members from destroying our gains in the peace process
5764877 if the milf cannot surrender their rogue members they can choose to disown them if these ground leaders do not adhere to their organizations tenets and they prove to be obstacles to the peace path then why dont the leaders expel them from the organization
5764878 they should not protect these elements from being pursued by the government forces if indeed they have acted on their own in attacking several parts of mindanao
5764879 im beginning to doubt if we are conducting peace talks with the right people this defiance to the directives of their hierarchy is a sign that those who are behind the attacks have gone rogue and are no longer part of the milfs chain of command it shows sign of weak leadership if the milf leaders cannot act to discipline their own members

5764921 epa should be evaluating the risks to bees before approving new pesticides but now refuses to tell the public what it knows pesticide restrictions might be at the heart of the solution to this growing crisis so why hide the information they should be using to make those decisions
5764922 epa needs to help shed some light so that researchers can get to work on this problem this isnt just an issue for farmers this is an issue that concerns us all just try to imagine a pizza without the contribution of bees no tomatoes no cheese no peppers if you eat apples cucumbers broccoli onions squash carrots avocados or cherries you need to be concerned

5764986 the fact is our education system isnt imperiled as much by the rogue teacher who has a sexual relationship with a student that person should simply be in jail as it is by the entrenched mediocrity that is bred by bad union policies such as teacher tenure and the absence of merit pay
5764987 we held this contest to jump start a conversation about the negative impact teachers unions are having on our public education system and to advocate on behalf of good teachers by promoting merit pay and opposing teacher tenure we hope to continue to promote these ideas any way we can

5765038 the second thing is if i lose my capacity for anger then i shouldnt be president of the united states when i see the waste and corruption in washington i get angry
5765039 international laws and rules are unreliable defense and promotion of a liberal order still depend on the possession of military might
5765040 to initiate a war of aggression is a supreme international crime in that it contains the accumulated evil of the whole
5765041 rather remarkable truth is that the iraqis have made enormous strides towards liberal democracy
5765042 there are hopeful signs that the iraqis of differing religious ethnic and political persuasions can work together a far cry from the predictions before the war both here and in europe that a liberated iraq would fracture into feuding clans
5765043 obviously the administration intends to publicize all the weapons of mass destruction u s forces find and there will be plenty
5765044 the answer will have to be invasion not merely an air and missile strike to put an end to irans nuclear program as well as its regime
5765045 if the u s decides it must take strong action it will have an easier time showing that all other options were exhausted
5765046 i do not believe that anyone should make promises as a candidate for president that they cannot keep if elected
5765047 to promise a withdrawal of our forces from iraq regardless of the calamitous consequences to the iraqi people our most vital interests and the future of the middle east is the height of irresponsibility
5765048 its a failure of leadership to support an open ended occupation of iraq that has failed to press iraqs leaders to reconcile badly overstretched our military put a strain on our military families set back our ability to lead the world and made the american people less safe
5765049 these likely consequences of americas failure in iraq would almost certainly require us to return to iraq or draw us into a wider and far costlier war
5765050 the dramatic reduction in violence has opened the way for a return to something approaching normal political and economic life for the average iraqi

5765052 john mccain impressed me as somebody who understood how the economy worked
5765053 i think that comment about not understanding economics which was made one time and blown totally out of proportion is frankly more a reflection of john mccains innate humility than anything else
5765054 when you think about how much this war has cost this country
5765055 how does the iraq war play into his economic goals
5765056 theres no question that the iraq war is costing us a lot of money
5765057 but its also the case that the housing crisis has nothing to do with the iraq war high fuel prices have nothing to do with the iraq war per se and high food prices in particular have nothing to do with the iraq war its not fair to try and make the iraq war the cause of our our current economic difficulties
5765058 when youre spending over 50 to fill up your car because the price of oil is four times what it was before iraq youre paying a price for this war when iraq is costing each household about 100 a month youre paying a price for this war
5765059 there is no job that is americas god given right any more
5765060 a year ago john mccain started calling for a substantial reform of unemployment insurance

5765063 the war is out of sight and mind in a way vietnam never was
5765064 i think from the beginning the plan with this was was to kind of keep it out of sight and out of mind
5765065 it blew up and now people just dont want to deal with the mess
5765066 you look at the polls everybody wants us out of iraq
5765067 and yet john mccain trusted by 14 percent more people on the iraq war than clinton or obama thats just strange because hes so wrapped in this unpopular war
5765068 if the democrats are going to win theyre going to have to make the case how hes wrapped
5765069 the biggest thing is that we keep maintaining we have this functioning democratic government thats standing up troops the white house announces and mccain does too the iraqis are in the lead well theyre in the lead for about 10 minutes the british and the americans had to rescue them
5765070 theres a sense that the country feels that they went into it lightly and now no one knows what to make of it no one knows what victory is it seems the only things we can measure it by are either having a functioning government in iraq which we dont or bringing troops home which were not

5765077 i can safely say i dont know if its meant to happen it will i love and adore being a mother i understand that raising children is universally difficult and that people read an article hoping for something worthwhile in it the truth is i am not on some inside track i have no incredible revelations to share

5765084 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy

5765110 we caught up with canonical the company behind ubuntu at the recent linux world event
5765111 it alluded to a big announcement that would tie ubuntu to a new netbook and this looks like the news weve been waiting for
5765112 the interesting part is that the version of ubuntu bundled with the dell machine is likely to be the new netbook remix edition
5765113 this is a version of ubuntu optimised for the atom processor and features a new big button interface much like the kind those found on the eeepc and aspire one
5765114 the dell machine might be the first chance we get to see what canonical has been working on all summer and its bound to have a significant impact on the netbook market

5765160 faux wood and silvery trim give a slightly upscale ambiance
5765161 dropped the awkward suv styling cues of yesteryear and now embraces its midsize wagon body
5765162 wedge shaped profile its suv like attributes are subtle but noticeable
5765163 aerodynamic ground effects components blend with more pronounced wheel arches to give it a bolder stance
5765164 few styling changes for 2008 most notably a new bumper and a restyled grille higher trim levels of the outback lose their two tone paint scheme for a monotone bumper with gray cladding at its lower edges
5765165 two tone color scheme multiple textures leather seating surfaces and faux wood and silvery plastic trim fill the bill and give a comfortable slightly upscale ambiance to the interior
5765166 two toned interiors are fitted with cloth upholstery on 2008 subaru outback basic 2 5i and 2 5i l l bean trims while the 2 5 xt limited and 3 0 r l l bean editions receive leather trim dashboard and control layout convey a down to business personality
5765167 output ranges from 170 to 245 hp with the six cylinder
5765168 output ranges from 170 horsepower in the base four cylinder to 245 hp with the six cylinder
5765169 non turbocharged 4 cylinder models have enough power for most driving but lack reserve muscle for passing and merging
5765170 turbocharged 243 hp 4 cylinder models provide good power 7 8 seconds 0 60 mph in our tests
5765171 the new 2 5 liter engine is indeed amazingly smooth and quiet
5765172 manual or automatic transmissions are available for the regular and turbocharged four cylinders
5765173 could use a fifth gear in many cases you can press the gas pedal halfway down without inducing a downshift which doesnt help your passing confidence
5765174 some find the manual transmission to have imprecise overly long shift action
5765175 automatic transmissions still leave much to be desired as they sap power by upshifting too early
5765176 mapping accelerator response and shift points according to three settings
5765177 subaru says intelligent mode yields up to a 10 percent increase in gas mileage while sport mode nets quicker accelerator response for better performance finally sport sharp modifies the accelerator and transmission for maximum performance
5765178 a 2 5i l l bean averaged 23 5 mpg in mostly highway driving
5765179 averaged 18 3 mpg in city highway driving 23 5 with more highway use
5765180 averaged 21 6 in mostly highway driving that included gas eating performance runs
5765181 the low center of gravity helps quell roll motions and reduce that tippy sensation you often get in heavy suvs
5765182 thanks to a steering rack bolted securely to the front suspension subframe the outback has very direct responses to the helm
5765183 all outbacks have linear predictable steering and brakes feel strong on all
5765184 firm suspension tuning along with responsive steering and the grip afforded by the all wheel drive system give the outback a nimble feel through the turns while still providing a comfy highway ride
5765185 ride comfort leads the 2008 subaru legacy outbacks list of benefits
5765186 on rougher surfaces the suspension tries its best to maintain a level attitude but some occupant tossing may occur
5765187 plenty of legroom but headroom is tight for taller riders
5765188 as midsize cars go the outbacks five seat cabin feels intimate total passenger volume ranges from 93 to 98 cubic feet depending on whether you have a moonroof
5765189 plenty of legroom but headroom is tight for taller riders
5765190 seat comfort is generally good though adults may find the backseat tight on legroom and shoulder room compared to roomier wagons and crossovers
5765191 two adults will find the outback wagon adequately roomy up front with up to three of all but the tallest riders accommodated in the rear
5765192 interior small item storage is lacking disappointing for an active lifestyle vehicle
5765193 with the rear seats up there is 33 5 cubic feet of cargo capacity flip them down and 66 cubic feet are available
5765194 interior is of fairly high quality compared with that of similarly priced cars especially on the less expensive models
5765195 heated seat controls have a rickety feel and the doors lack window frames so they dont shut with as much heft as ive come to expect in a midsize car
5765196 assembly quality has been good on models tested with revamped interior materials are class appropriate though nothing special given subarus near premium pricing
5765197 turbocharged and 6 cylinder engines are subdued and refined some testers complain of body drumming over broken pavement
5765198 a fair amount of road and wind noise filters into the cabin at highway speeds
5765199 standard equipment includes four wheel disc antilock brakes side impact airbags for the front seats and side curtain airbags for both rows
5765200 anti whiplash front head restraints are standard on every 2008 subaru outback
5765201 stability control is available on all trims except the base and 2 5i 2008 subaru outback
5765202 outbacks seating position provides a more commanding view than ordinary wagons
5765203 spring for the 2 5i limited l l bean you get all of the above features
5765204 lavishly appointed l l bean edition includes heated leather upholstery
5765205 come fairly well equipped with power windows and door locks a cd stereo and remote keyless entry
5765206 standard equipment on the base trim includes 16 inch steel wheels roof rails air conditioning a tilt and telescopic steering wheel a satellite radio ready audio system with cd player and an mp3 player jack keyless entry an outside temperature display and full power accessories
5765207 lavishly appointed l l bean edition 2008 subaru legacy outback includes heated leather upholstery power front seats and a navigation system
5765208 the 2 5i adds 17 inch alloy wheels a limited slip rear differential roof rail crossbars heated exterior mirrors deicing wipers a power driver seat and front seat heaters
5765209 is a little more upscale and features dual zone automatic climate control an in dash cd changer a navigation system and specialized floor mats
5765210 spring for the 2 5i limited l l bean and as youd guess you get all of the above features as standard
5765211 wood trim around the lower dashboard is the only letdown
5765212 true its not a groundbreaking design and it even bears some of the quirks that have come to characterize subaru such as a chunky hood scoop
5765213 but the legacy does possess a more metropolitan character than in generations past
5765214 sheetmetal up front is the biggest change for the subaru 2008 the legacy gets a new bigger chromed up grille restyled bumpers front and rear with shorter overhangs and new headlights and taillights
5765215 in lieu of the three piece winged grille splayed across the b9 tribeca suv the legacy offers a more conservative single piece grille bisected by a winged crossbar
5765216 decidedly sporty three spoke steering wheel metallic trim and crisp contemporary styling
5765217 wood trim that wraps around the lower dashboard and center console is the only letdown
5765218 would have much preferred brushed aluminum to the fake plasticky looking rosewood
5765219 gorgeous black faced gauges with white numbering and red needles make it easy to forgive the other minor shortcomings
5765220 the legacy gt limited is truly a fun car to drive hard
5765221 standard legacys use a 175 horsepower 2 5 liter horizontally opposed four cylinder engine
5765222 provides adequate power the legacy gt limited with its turbocharged engine is truly a fun car to drive hard
5765223 teams with a four speed automatic or five speed manual transmission
5765224 find the manual transmission to have imprecise overly long shift action
5765225 one glaring bit of criticism has been the gt limiteds automatic transmission which seems to be ill suited for the vehicles turbocharged engine
5765226 subarus si drive works with the 3 0 r limited and 2 5 gt limited by mapping accelerator response and shift points according to three settings
5765227 subaru says intelligent mode yields up to a 10 percent increase in gas mileage while sport mode nets quicker accelerator response for better performance finally sport sharp modifies the accelerator and transmission for maximum performance
5765228 found the subaru legacy to be both sporty and comfortable a challenging combination for manufacturers to master
5765229 handling is composed with little body lean in fast corners
5765230 bilstein sport suspension equips the legacy 3 0 r limited with performance tuned shock absorbers for improved cornering
5765231 plenty of legroom but headroom is tight for taller riders
5765232 plenty of legroom but headroom is tight for taller riders
5765233 the backseat is a lowlight however while its comfortable enough for two average sized passengers leg and shoulder room are unusually tight compared with other midsize sedans
5765234 most backseat passengers should find the legacy plenty accommodating for trips across town and beyond
5765235 luggage capacity is a smallish for a midsize sedan 11 4 cubic feet
5765236 the legacys trunk is similarly undersized at 11 4 cubic feet though a ski pass through and fold down rear seats help make the most of the cars hauling capacity
5765237 are related to new equipment the steering wheel has 16 buttons a tricky layout where a wrong move could inadvertently remap the accelerators response or downshift the transmission
5765238 excellent and style fit and finish are competitive with more expensive european marques
5765239 a fair amount of wind and tire noise filters into the cabin at highway speeds
5765240 four wheel disc antilock brakes side impact airbags and side curtain airbags are standard on every legacy
5765241 garnered the highest award from the insurance institute for highway safety iihs top safety pick in the midsize car segment
5765242 four wheel disc antilock brakes side impact airbags and side curtain airbags are standard
5765243 all legacys include staples like power windows and door locks
5765244 include staples like power windows and door locks remote keyless entry and a cd stereo
5765245 other trims are well equipped and can make the legacy as luxurious and comfortable as some midsize cars wearing luxury badges
5765246 dvd touch screen navigation system in dash six cd changer power glass moonroof leather seating power drivers seat heated front seats dual zone automatic climate control fog lights heated side mirrors wiper de icer leather wrapped steering wheel and shifter wood look trim and front sport seats
5765247 the restyled impreza is meant to appeal to a more mainstream audience
5765248 a more controversial aspect however is the cars exterior styling not because the new impreza looks bad in a pontiac aztek sort of way but because it doesnt look like well a subaru
5765249 a little more attractive than the sedan but looks exactly like another car that sells incredibly well the mazda
5765250 looks more like a traditional hatchback this time around so fans of the old wagon might be disappointed
5765251 looks fast standing still in spite of its somewhat utilitarian five door configuration
5765252 it features a two tone appearance with the lower section of the body a contrasting grayish silver hue
5765253 cabin is more subdued than before with no embroidered logos to remind occupants what theyre sitting in and trim is a metal ized silver plastic
5765254 far more inviting than before but it retains the cars businesslike austerity
5765255 were not asking for a soho lounge but subaru could stand to make the cars interior slightly more inviting
5765256 the impreza looks and feels more grown up than ever before
5765257 curb weights are hefty performance is tepid as a consequence
5765258 survives largely unchanged from the previous generation impreza albeit with a slight bump in horsepower and torque power is up to 170 hp at 6000 rpm torque climbs to 170 lb ft and the torque peak has fallen from 4400 rpm to 4000 rpm
5765259 enough to move the car along just fine in most driving scenarios
5765260 curb weights are hefty for a compact and performance is tepid as a consequence
5765261 five speed manual transmission is standard a four speed automatic with a manual shift mode is optional and all wheel drive is standard
5765262 with just four cogs to work with the automatic tranny lags behind a few rivals that offer five or even six speeds
5765263 we recommend that enthusiast oriented drivers choose the manual transmission acceleration is sluggish with the four speed automatic
5765264 the manual transmission however is something subaru needs to work on sure the shifts are long again its not a wrx but the impreza begs for a tall sixth gear
5765265 in the pursuit of daily driver comfort the 2 5i is very lightly sprung which over most broken michigan road surfaces delivers a smooth ride and copious amounts of body roll its nothing too obtrusive in mild city driving but in harder cornering the car wallows
5765266 steering feel is responsive if not as razor sharp as would be expected in a sporty car
5765267 subaru says the interior offers greater backseat headroom and more shoulder and headroom up front
5765268 the wheelbase has been extended to increase rear seat legroom
5765269 cabin materials look nice theyre comprised mainly of cheap feeling hard plastic the mouse fur headliner is particularly cut rate
5765270 the plastic interior was my biggest beef with this car the controls feel light and breakable
5765271 fit and finish for most surfaces is fine but were perplexed at the use of coarse plastics on the shift knob and steering wheel the two places drivers touch most often
5765272 wind and tire noise are moderate at highway speeds the turbocharged engine whines under full throttle but its more relaxed at cruising speeds
5765273 front disc and rear drum brakes on 2 5i models
5765274 oddly shaped rearmost pillars intrude in the subaru 2008 outward vision a bit but only when the rear seats are folded when up the rear seat head restraints block the pillars
5765275 manual transmission models get the incline start assist which prevents the car from rolling backward on a hill
5765276 navigation package which adds a touch screen gps system and bluetooth capability
5765277 include body molding colors various deck lid spoilers a battery warmer a subwoofer and power amp for the base audio system and xm or sirius satellite radio hardware
5765278 jet aviation brings gd a complementary portfolio of services global presence and trusted partner image that should bolster potential to hold expand market share of its gulfstream products particularly abroad
5765279 this is a business for us that is blessed with opportunity
5765280 esta ley incrementa la intervenci n centralizada y la consecuencia directa de ello es un menor nivel de seguridad alimentaria para la poblaci n por eso creemos fundamental que podamos todos los sectores del pa s discutir sobre estos temas porque la meta com n es incrementar la seguridad alimentaria y eso para cavidea es fundamental
5765281 sino a la planificaci n centralizada que de la producci n agr cola se haga
5765282 es importante de entender que el consumidor en este sentido pierde poder pierde soberan a en la medida que sean planes centralizados lo que decida qu es lo que se va a producir desde el punto de vista agr cola
5765283 hay que entender que el productor agr cola es fundamentalmente un agente econ mico que pone m s all de su tiempo esfuerzo capital recursos que arriesga por lo tanto nos preocupa que las ganancias que tenga el productor no se tomar n en cuenta los riesgos recursos y esfuerzo del productor
5765284 el criterio fundamental de compensaci n es el tiempo invertido y ese no es el nico recurso que utiliza un productor agr cola para generar sus bienes porque el esfuerzo y los costos de producci n son elementos fundamentales
5765285 la industria va a tener menor capacidad de producci n de alimentos
5765286 eso preocupa por lo delicada que es la cadena agroalimentaria
5765287 tanto la industria como los productores no se niegan a la fiscalizaci n y al control pero si es importante tener certeza sobre qu es lo que se est regulando fiscalizando la ley no es clara sobre estos elementos y va a tener un efecto negativo
5765288 se pudiera migrar a otras actividades cuando en realidad lo que hay es que estimular la producci n nacional en el campo desde cavidea establecimos como meta el crecimiento del 60 por ciento de la producci n de materia prima nacional en los pr ximos 10 a os y creemos que esos son los objetivos que debemos perseguir
5765289 esta ley permite al estado la posibilidad de sustituir al productor en sus decisiones productivas y comerciales lo que genera incertidumbre y desincentiva la producci n yo creo que la mayor a de los productores es importante que se respete ese conocimiento local m s all de que haya transferencia tecnol gica
5765290 la industria s lo puede producir aquellos alimentos para los que exista materia prima y una de las columnas vertebrales es la materia prima
5765291 hemos planteado la necesidad de disminuir la dependencia de importaciones de productos terminados no obstante la preocupaci n concreta de este caso es que la materia prima va a depender de la planificaci n y no de las demandas y necesidades de los consumidores
5765292 m s all de favorecer la producci n la permisolog a creemos que pueden incrementar trabas e interrumpir procesos necesarios certificado de no producci n y de demanda interna satisfecha que se requieren para una cantidad de productos que no son deseables desde el punto de vista productivo
5765293 esto ratifica la posici n de cavidea y lo que se plante como plan en la asamblea de nuestro organismo
5765294 en el que se establece que las pol ticas agroalimentarias p blicas no debe juzgarse por sus intenciones sino por sus consecuencias
5765295 por lo menos tuvimos la oportunidad de explicar nuestro caso dentro de la complejidad es bastante sencillo porque tanto nuestra constituci n como la convenci n americana de derechos humanos son demasiado claras dice que si no hay una sentencia judicial penal firme no hay manera de sacar una persona de la contienda electoral y eso es lo que ocurri en nuestro pa s
5765296 considerando que el transexualismo es un deseo de vivir aceptado en la condici n de persona del sexo opuesto y que en general viene acompa ado de malestar o sentimiento de inadaptaci n estas situaciones deben ser abordadas dentro del sistema de la salud integral p blica

5765299 works better when you see it in person than it does in photos
5765300 the front end looks too long and out of proportion with the rest of the car
5765301 the styling all new for 2008 isnt unattractive but it wont steal the spotlight either while most of the exterior is shared between the sedan and hatchback models the sedan gets rather frumpy aft of the rear doors the led taillights found on the hatchback are nowhere to be found replaced by lights that at best are simply anonymous
5765302 not because the new impreza looks bad in a pontiac aztek sort of way but because it doesnt look like well a subaru
5765303 the impreza looks and feels more grown up than ever before
5765304 far more inviting than before but it retains the cars businesslike austerity
5765305 inoffensive but boring as well designers tried to liven things up with a colored band that appears to wrap across the dashboard but our imprezas interior was a sea of beige beige plastics beige cloth beige headliner beige flooring etc
5765306 some changes in the power distribution over the engine speed range though the peak horsepower and torque coming 400 and 800 rpm lower respectively
5765307 more oomph when accelerating from a stop in addition to climbing up to cruising speed or passing
5765308 combination of a 170 horsepower 2 5 liter flat four engine a five speed manual transmission and full time all wheel drive sounds like a recipe for fun
5765309 high carb mixture thanks to the imprezas 3 064 lb curb weight resulting in pokey acceleration even though the powertrain gives it all its got
5765310 curb weights are hefty for a compact and performance is tepid as a consequence
5765311 with just four cogs to work with the automatic tranny lags behind a few rivals that offer five or even six speeds
5765312 we recommend that enthusiast oriented drivers choose the manual transmission acceleration is sluggish with the four speed automatic
5765313 the manual transmission however is something subaru needs to work on sure the shifts are long again its not a wrx but the impreza begs for a tall sixth gear
5765314 saw an indicated 22 mpg with a mix of spirited driving and highway cruising
5765315 when it comes to road manners the littlest subie is pretty sedate the 2 5i gets the softest suspension of the impreza lot which is to say that its comfortable over bumps but not terribly sporty
5765316 on one hand theres a surprising amount of grip and because of the all wheel drive you can carry quite a bit of speed to a corner but the soft springs mean lots of body roll and the lack of power means that carrying the speed out of the corner doesnt really happen
5765317 cargo space is not a strong point at least in the sedans
5765318 theres not one padded piece of plastic in this car
5765319 the wheelbase has been extended to increase rear seat legroom
5765320 front seats in the subaru 2008 impreza 2 5i are very good although all the adjustments are manual there are plenty of them including a ratcheting seat height adjustment
5765321 average for the class six footers will fit in back but theyll have barely adequate legroom and knee space
5765322 poor with a small center console and just average sized glovebox and door map pockets
5765323 well laid out with everything easy to read and reach
5765324 aims for an upscale ambiance but comes up short while the cabin materials look nice theyre comprised mainly of cheap feeling hard plastic
5765325 fit and finish for most surfaces is fine but were perplexed at the use of coarse plastics on the shift knob and steering wheel the two places drivers touch most often
5765326 wind and tire noise are moderate at highway speeds the turbocharged engine whines under full throttle but its more relaxed at cruising speeds noise from all sources is more pronounced in sti
5765327 this subie bucks that trend with an interior mostly free of annoying noises at speed there is some wind noise around the mirrors and there is enough road noise filtering through the car to let you know youre under way but neither is particularly bad
5765328 standard safety features on the impreza include antilock brakes and side curtain airbags base 2 5i models have rear drum brakes
5765329 getting a 2 5i with the premium package is a wise idea as it adds rear disc brakes and the brake assist ba feature for the antilock brakes
5765330 abs on these cars is among the most sophisticated available
5765331 standard side impact torso airbags for the front occupants plus curtain airbags that cover the side windows completely are standard and contribute to the models good scores
5765332 seeing out of the imprezas big airy greenhouse is easy enough with no particularly bad blind spots to speak of mirrors are well sized for the car both inside and out and the view to the side and front is also very good
5765333 reasonably well equipped with a full complement of power features
5765334 audio system with speed sensing volume adjustment and other nice bits
5765335 16 inch steel wheels air conditioning a cd mp3 player cruise control tilt steering and full power accessories
5765336 comes reasonably well equipped with side impact airbags and a cd audio system included as standard features
5765337 admittedly the impreza is well equipped with standard all wheel drive a five speed manual anti lock brakes an audio system with speed sensing volume adjustment and other nice bits
5765338 noteworthy options include heated seats and side mirrors a premium surround sound audio system an ipod adapter and a gps navigation system
5765339 premium package bundles alloy wheels vehicle stability control rear disc brakes fog lights and leather wrapped steering wheel and shifter while the satellite radio and nav package throws a better audio system and navigation on top of that

5765355 la gente piensa que cuando digo diva es que quiero 20 carteras louis vuitton 30 zapatos gucci soy una mujer y me gusta que me mimen que me regalen flores y que me abran la puerta cuando me subo al auto yo lo que quiero es que respeten mi trabajo y el n cleo que lo rodea
5765356 mis compa eros y mis seguidores me pusieron ese apodo pero si me tengo que sentar en el piso a esperar que llegue mi avi n me siento yo no creo que una diva lo haga pero yo soy una mujer normal
5765357 yo cuido mi carrera por eso a m nunca me han retratado en traje de ba o tengo en mi casa una piscina y si voy a tomar el sol lo hago all no es que no quiera salir es que como soy un ser humano com n y corriente quiero evitar confrontaciones
5765358 si alguien quiere buscar problemas obviamente yo lo voy a golpear
5765359 yo siento que tengo muchos seguidores que me admiran muchas mujeres que tal vez quieran vestir como yo y muchos hombres que se identifican con mis letras

5765370 we have a saying that if your two wives quarrel with each other its better for the husband
5765371 if two women agree with each other about a man its his end
5765372 a set of web components can be dropped into any existing website that will then allow the user to authenticate using his fingerprint assuming the user has the appropriate hardware instead of a password
5765373 to ensure security at the local machine each upek chipset solution has a discrete identification and information sent to a device can only be opened by that specific device
5765374 this prevents device swapping or tampering at the local level
5765375 so i think the handwriting on the wall is that if the governments of the world are beginning to implement biometric as the default authentication to proving who you are then that ubiquitous availability of both the credential and the availability of commercial products to make use of that credential are going to make biometric authentication credentials across the board default in the five to 10 year timeframe
5765376 third party authentication methods like kerberos help do this so do information card systems like microsoft windows cardspace and so do single sign on systems
5765377 all of these systems of course aggregate risk at the point of initial login so that point needs to be strongly defended the second step should be to replace the initial login password with something which is stronger a cryptographic key which resides and is used on the client or a time variant secret like a one time password open source versions of both information cards the higgins project and one time passwords oath are available so the cost of these schemes is all in design and deployment
5765378 a better configuration is using a biometric to unlock a personal device and using the device as a strong authenticator using a cryptographic protocol a one time password mechanism or some other strong authentication technology

5765465 a toronto based non profit group wired more than 3 million to overseas bank accounts some of them linked to the tamil tigers before it was shut down by the government in june for alleged terrorist financing says an rcmp report released yesterday
5765466 is utilized as a vehicle to forward money to the ltte liberation tigers of tamil eelam from canada
5765467 the 83 page financial report is the fruit of two years of analysis of banking records seized by canadian anti terrorism police who are investigating a financial network run by supporters of the tamil tigers that allegedly raised money in canada to buy arms for the guerrillas
5765468 the bank records seized demonstrate that the world tamil movement has developed an elaborate machine like entity that moves throughout the greater toronto area collecting funds with extreme proficiency
5765469 stockwell day public safety minister announced on june 16 that his government had added the wtm to ottawas official list of terrorist groups alongside the likes of al qaeda hamas and hezbollah the wtm is the first canadian community group to be listed
5765470 the wtm has denied any involvement in terrorist fundraising and vowed to challenge the governments decision and at a large outdoor rally in toronto on july 5 tamils waved tamil tigers flags and endorsed a statement condemning ottawas decision to ban the wtm
5765471 the minister has accused the wtm of transferring money to ltte bank accounts in sri lanka but the rcmps feb 1 2008 financial report paints a more detailed picture of a complex network made up of 20 canadian bank accounts
5765472 five banks held the accounts toronto dominion bank of nova scotia royal bank cibc and the national bank of canada the canadian account holders wired money regularly to accounts in malaysia singapore the united kingdom and tamil tigers controlled areas of sri lanka
5765473 rcmp corporal deanna hill the author of the police report wrote that the wtms financial set up was
5765474 i also believe that the number of accounts alone demonstrate that the world tamil movement has utilized the canadian banking system to raise funds in a manner that is best suited to financing the terrorist activities of the ltte
5765475 the tamil tigers have been fighting for 25 years for an independent homeland for sri lankas ethnic tamil minority which has faced discrimination under the islands sinhalese majority
5765476 in addition to fighting a conventional guerrilla war however the tigers also employ terrorist tactics such as suicide bombings and political assassinations which has landed them on international terrorist lists canadas included
5765477 the rcmp began investigating the tamil tigers canadian fundraising network in 2002 focusing on the wtms large head office in toronto and its smaller branch offices in montreal and vancouver police raided the toronto and montreal offices in 2006
5765478 police seized letters from the tamil tigers leadership thanking canada for its donations explaining how the money had been used to purchase weapons and asking for more but much of the police evidence appears to have come from a study of bank accounts held by the wtm and its officers
5765479 the project osaluki financial report claims the wtms most lucrative fundraising method was a pre authorized payment program in which the group persuaded hundreds of its supporters to sign forms allowing money to be withdrawn from their bank accounts each month
5765480 the wtm took in up to 763 000 a year using the payment scheme
5765481 it is obvious from the amounts collected with this method that the pre authorized payment scheme is effective timely and spares valued resources
5765482 most of the forms had been signed in canada but police also interviewed witnesses who said they had signed them at tamil tigers checkpoints in sri lanka
5765483 upon their return to canada these persons were visited by representatives of the world tamil movement to exact the collection of the monthly stipend

5765717 it is also a story of how both democrats and republicans have misread russias determination to dominate its traditional sphere of influence

5765734 new york is in a very very intense fiscal woe right now not all because of any fault of new yorkers and even new yorks government we get back 82 billion less than we pay in taxes to the federal government it is by far the poorest percentage of all the states
5765735 secondly 20 percent of our revenues are derived from wall street and the money just isnt coming into the markets
5765736 nonetheless we have to take responsibility and we have to find ways to balance our budget and continue a quality of life for ourselves and our children as governor even though it was in the middle of summer even though it was in a political season i called the legislature back to albany
5765737 at first it wasnt exactly met with much encouragement but in the end after weeks of persuasion and demonstrating that the statistic i gave forecast a very poor economic performance in the state the legislature came back they came back and they acted and they acted for a governor who didnt harass them didnt insult them didnt respond to negative and personal ads who simply kept telling the truth and eventually persuaded the government in this state that we have to be proactive and make the adjustments and spending cuts that we need to go forward

5765739 oil has lost its bullish mojo and it may take a major event or a great technical stand to go get its grove back
5765740 the same way this market seemingly overreacted to every bullish nugget of information on the way up it is now ignoring those same nuggets on the way down
5765741 bought as a hedge against systemic risk in the economy
5765742 it seems that now the market is reducing those risk factors or at the very least acknowledging that perhaps oil is not the best hedge against that risk in a slowing global economy
5765743 demand is slowing and that changes the outlook for everything as we go forward
5765744 would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5765745 the current level of economic activity is sufficient to support oil prices at these or even higher levels
5765746 we still live in a world where consumption of petroleum products is quite high and although slowing global economic growth has provided a temporary breather supplies will be pressed and even harder once growth begins again

5765769 the visitors in nuremberg including many foreigners were so impressed they were ready to disregard the repulsive aspects of the regime

5766003 we literary scholars have mostly failed to generate surer and firmer knowledge about the things we study while most other fields gradually accumulate new and durable understanding about the world the great minds of literary studies have over the past few decades chiefly produced theories and speculation with little relevance to anyone but the scholars themselves so instead of steadily building a body of solid knowledge about literature culture and the human condition the field wanders in continuous circles bending with fashions and the pronouncements of its charismatic leaders

5766078 in conclusion we feel that the evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of stay
5766079 the potential benefits to individual patients in health economics terms are such that a well designed large scale blinded randomized controlled trial with a placebo arm is warranted to answer the question of whether gum chewing can significantly reduce the length of stay after abdominal surgery or whether it merely represents a placebo effect
5766080 money is not the tool of the moochers who claim your product by tears or of the looters who take it from you by force money is made possible only by the men who produce
5766081 money rests on the maxim that man is the owner of his mind and his effort
5766082 money is the scourge of the men who attempt to reverse the law of causality the men who seek to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind
5766083 you will see the rise of the men of the double standard the men who live by force yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted money the men who are the hitch hikers of virtue
5766084 when you see that money is flowing to those who deal not in goods but in favors when you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work and your laws dont protect you against them but protect them against you when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self sacrifice you may know that your society is doomed money is so noble a medium that it does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality it will not permit a country to survive as half property half loot
5766085 do not expect them to produce when production is punished and looting rewarded
5766086 you look upon money as the savages did before you and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of your cities throughout mens history money was always seized by looters of one brand or another whose names changed but whose method remained the same to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound demeaned defamed deprived of honor
5766087 to the glory of mankind there was for the first and only time in history a country of money and i have no higher more reverent tribute to pay to america for this means a country of reason justice freedom production achievement for the first time mans mind and money were set free and there were no fortunes by conquest but only fortunes by work
5766088 if you ask me to name the proudest distinction of americans i would choose because it contains all the others the fact that they were the people who created the phrase to make money no other language or nation had ever used these words before men had always thought of wealth as a static quantity to be seized begged inherited shared looted or obtained as a favor americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created

5766094 damit wir nicht mehr unm ndige seien umhergeworfen und herumgetrieben von jedem wind der lehre durch die spielerei der menschen durch die schlauheit mit der sie zum irrtum verf hren
5766095 so spricht der herr der heerscharen h ret nicht auf die worte der propheten die euch weissagen
5766096 darum gehe ich nun gegen die propheten vor spruch des herrn die einander meine worte stehlen nun gehe ich gegen die propheten vor spruch des herrn die ihre zunge gebrauchen um spr che zu machen ja nun gehe ich gegen die propheten mit ihren erlogenen tr umen vor spruch des herrn sie erz hlen die tr ume und verf hren mein volk durch ihre l gen und ihr freches geschw tz ich aber habe sie weder gesandt noch beauftragt und sie sind diesem volk ganz unn tz spruch des herrn
5766097 da sprach der herr zu mir l gen prophezeien diese propheten in meinem namen ich habe sie nicht gesandt ihnen nichts befohlen und nichts zu ihnen geredet l gengesichte und wahrsagerei hirngespinste und einbildungen ihres eigenen herzens predigen sie euch
5766098 ich sandte diese propheten nicht dennoch liefen sie ich redete nicht zu ihnen dennoch weissagten sie h tten sie in meinem rate gestanden so w rden sie meinem volke meine worte predigen und sie abbringen von ihrem b sen wege und von ihren schlimmen taten
5766099 ihre propheten sind schw tzer und schwindler ihre priester entweihen das heiligtum und unterwerfen gottes gesetz der eigenen willk r
5766100 ihre h upter sprechen recht um geschenke ihre priester lehren um lohn und ihre propheten wahrsagen um geld und dabei st tzen sie sich auf den herrn und sagen ist nicht der herr unter uns
5766101 aber die pforte ist eng und der weg ist schmal der zum leben f hrt und wenige sind es die ihn finden h tet euch aber vor den falschen propheten welche in schafskleidern zu euch kommen inwendig aber rei ende w lfe sind an ihren fr chten sollt ihr sie erkennen sammelt man auch trauben von dornen oder feigen von disteln
5766102 aber auch diese taumeln vom wein und schwanken von starkem getr nk priester und prophet sind von starkem getr nk berauscht vom wein benebelt verleitet durch berauschende getr nke sie sehen nicht mehr klar urteilen unsicher
5766103 denn sowohl der prophet als auch der priester sind ruchlos sogar in meinem hause habe ich ihre bosheit gefunden
5766104 aber bei den propheten zu jerusalem habe ich schauderhaftes wahrgenommen n mlich ehebruch und betr gerischen lebenswandel sie st rken die h nde der b sen so da niemand mehr von seiner bosheit umkehrt sie sind mir alle wie sodomiter geworden und ihre einwohner wie die von gomorra
5766105 da ging ein geist aus und trat vor den herrn und sprach ich will ihn berreden der herr sprach zu ihm womit er sprach ich will ausgehen und ein l gengeist sein im munde aller seiner propheten er sprach du sollst ihn berreden und du wirst es auch verm gen gehe aus und tue also
5766106 die propheten weissagen falsch und die priester herrschen mit ihrer unterst tzung und mein volk liebt es so was wollt ihr aber tun wenn das ende davon kommt
5766107 da sprach der herr zu mir l gen prophezeien diese propheten in meinem namen ich habe sie nicht gesandt ihnen nichts befohlen und nichts zu ihnen geredet l gengesichte und wahrsagerei hirngespinste und einbildungen ihres eigenen herzens predigen sie euch
5766108 so spricht der herr der heerscharen h ret nicht auf die worte der propheten die euch weissagen
5766109 und als sie die ganze insel bis nach paphos durchzogen hatten fanden sie einen j dischen zauberer und falschen propheten namens barjesus
5766110 der prophet der einen traum hat erz hle den traum wer aber mein wort hat der predige mein wort wahrhaftig was hat das stroh mit dem weizen gemein spricht der herr
5766111 siehe ich will an die propheten spricht der herr welche erlogene tr ume erz hlen und durch ihre l gen und prahlereien mein volk irref hren da ich sie doch nicht gesandt und ihnen nichts befohlen habe und sie auch diesem volk gar nichts n tzen k nnen spricht der herr
5766112 die propheten weissagen falsch und die priester herrschen mit ihrer unterst tzung und mein volk liebt es so was wollt ihr aber tun wenn das ende davon kommt
5766113 wehe euch wenn alle leute wohl von euch reden ebenso taten ihre v ter den falschen propheten
5766114 dann wisse wenn der prophet im namen des herrn redet und es wird nichts daraus und trifft nicht ein so ist es ein wort das der herr nicht geredet hat der prophet hat aus vermessenheit geredet darum erschrick nicht vor ihm
5766115 geliebte glaubet nicht jedem geist sondern pr fet die geister ob sie von gott sind denn es sind viele falsche propheten hinausgegangen in die welt
5766116 und es werden viele falsche propheten auftreten und werden viele verf hren
5766117 denn es werden falsche christusse gesalbte und falsche propheten auftreten und werden gro e zeichen und wunder tun um wom glich auch die auserw hlten zu verf hren
5766118 so sollst du den worten eines solchen propheten oder tr umers nicht gehorchen denn der herr euer gott versucht euch damit er erfahre ob ihr den herrn euren gott liebet von ganzem herzen und von ganzer seele

5766139 weve seen people hunkering down and staying in their job whether they were happy or not
5766140 they believe everything is worse than it was a year ago and its likely to get worse than it is today
5766141 that is making people more conservative in their discretionary spending it sort of feels like a lot of people are taking a wait and see attitude while they prepare for a degradation in their personal economic situation
5766142 the reality is most people cant take advantage of such programs
5766143 i watch the guys climbing up ladders with poles changing the prices every week
5766144 my big gest concern is that somebody is going to walk in and say im quitting because i cant afford to keep coming here
5766145 and people seem to have really appreciated it it doesnt cover all their commuting costs but they dont expect that this gives them a little more breathing space it costs us an extra 20 000 25 000 a year but fortunately were in a business that even in this economy is doing very well so we can afford it

5766157 our employees tend to come from within a 25 mile radius but weve got some outliers probably about 80 percent of our people were driving to work because the way that public transportation in long island is set up made it impractical for them to use we also had the problem of having two hospitals in affluent areas where it was too expensive for some of our staff to live we had trouble filling jobs for housekeepers nursing attendants and others because they had to come from far away and it cost too much
5766158 we have several folks who are taking us up on that

5766191 niente solo che non ti avevo mai visto bene le mani tutto qui
5766192 ma la stessa persona che mi faceva i sermoni su quanto fossero buoni i preservativi alla frutta
5766193 im 39 and ive worked all over the world asia europe canada and the u s i recently returned to a top american ivy league school for a masters i was stunned to discover the degree to which canadian immigration is being abused
5766194 i had dinner with six good buddies all from questionable foreign countries pakistan syria all great guys and i found out they were all canadian
5766195 none of these guys has spent more than a few weeks in canada yet four were citizens and two were permanent residents who will become full blown citizens shortly
5766196 they come from rich families in corrupt countries and they travel the world freely on our passports without ever paying a dime in tax heres how it works
5766197 extremely rich people from corrupt countries apply for permanent residency at their local embassy and it is my guess that their certain special influence is exerted so they can get themselves and members of the family into canada as immigrants
5766198 they visit canada for a few weeks get bank accounts buy a condo then hit the road and leave canada letting the clock tick until they qualify for canadian citizenship
5766199 once they have a passport the party begins and they can come back and forth to use our services at will without contributing to taxes
5766200 these people are rich beyond our wildest dreams a spare condo in toronto or vancouver is chump change if one looks upon it as free entitlements like health care needed insurance against a collapse at home or a change in government
5766201 i started chatting with a guy from india who was a landed immigrant even though he had never even visited canada he obtained his residence permit by applying in singapore then moved directly to the u s where he studied at a mediocre school
5766202 he is trying to become a permanent u s resident and when i suggested that he could just work for a canadian bank in toronto where salaries were roughly the same he looked utterly disgusted that i could even make such a suggestion
5766203 i assure you he will get our passport and use us like dogs travel and work worldwide without paying a dollar in taxes or giving a damn about the place its a step up to a more respected passport for free
5766204 this is so common in the u s that i just stopped paying attention but it is important and relevant because these guys are not only cheapening the canadian good name but they are taking up previous immigration seats that our economy desperately needs furthermore processing each permanent resident and new citizen costs money

5766373 learn to focus on whats right in the relationship not always on whats wrong

5766375 when couples spend too much time together they get a kind of cabin fever going and no cabin is even required instead of staying attractive and sharing affection people settle into their familiar habits and patterns and eventually share their discontent and maybe some contempt
5766376 to keep love alive both parties have to keep themselves attractive to each other and give attention appreciation and affection for each others best efforts

5766420 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5766421 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5766422 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5766423 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5766424 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5766425 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5766426 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5766427 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5766428 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5766429 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5766430 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5766431 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5766432 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5766433 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

5766435 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5766436 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

5766440 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5766441 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5766442 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5766443 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5766444 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5766445 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5766446 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5766447 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5766448 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5766449 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5766450 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5766451 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5766452 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5766453 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5766454 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5766455 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5766456 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5766457 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5766458 jim fallows has an excellent piece in this months atlantic
5766459 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5766460 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche

5766463 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5766464 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5766465 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas

5766469 es war zumindest f r das publikum toll immer mit zehn kilo vorsprung zu gewinnen ist doch langweilig aber es war auch ein toller wettkampf f r mich als ich den 3 versuch im rei en weggeschmissen hatte bin ich in ein loch gefallen und deshalb ging auch der erste im sto en schief aber dadurch bin ich noch mal munter geworden ich hatte sicher keine topform und alle wissen dass ich es besser kann als heute gezeigt aber ich wollte das gold ich wusste ich habe silber sicher mir gef llt gold aber besser

5766472 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5766473 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5766474 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5766475 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie

5766483 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5766484 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

5766493 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5766494 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5766495 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5766496 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

5766528 accounting sucks less everything makes it suck less our flagship product lessaccounting com was built with ease of use at the core of the accounting software which caters to small businesses and freelancers the app just got even better by integrating with basecamp and highrise to make importing contacts ridiculously simple
5766529 we literally generated whole tubs in the lab from scratch
5766530 the beautiful thing is that you start with one line expand them indefinitely and generate as many as you want
5766531 at this stage the work is very promising but has not progressed to the stage where the cultured cells are fully equivalent
5766532 much more work will yet be needed before this becomes a practical reality
5766533 domestically it could be the lifeblood of the game and has a huge amount of relevance and importance there
5766534 perhaps domestically is where the target market for it is
5766535 twenty20 is very much on its own as a lottery which can go either way
5766536 internationally it is good to play a world tournament once every two years and to have a little international to almost launch your one day campaign
5766537 it plays a huge role at domestic level and the injection of twenty20 has been fantastic for world cricket
5766538 if i had to bet my life on it id bet it is joe
5766539 barack is moving toward a seasoned beltway type and that probably means biden
5766540 joe wont be afraid to get in mccains face which is what obama needs
5766541 obamas shifting stance on space exploration is indicative of his inexperience on issues important to voters
5766542 lets be honest obama is only embracing nasa now because of his political problems in florida
5766543 something that is elemental and a vital part of our space program
5766544 i think weve got to sort out our priorities better in other words we cant do everything
5766545 to maintain a robust program of human space exploration and continue our nations pre eminence in space
5766546 considering obamas shifting positions he cannot be trusted to fully support nasas mission to mars
5766547 the only thing barack obama knows about sending a man to the moon is that its a good applause line

5766550 i was walking down saratoga street just around the corner from city hall
5766551 they asked me for money but i did not have any cash on me i guess that upset them even more
5766552 i was scared as hell but somehow i managed to get away from them and somebody called police and the ambulance
5766553 they were taking my new shoes after the ambulance guys took them off
5766554 when i asked to get them back they told me that they had to keep them as evidence evidence what for
5766555 i was standing there in the middle of the street just 50 feet away from the policeman sitting in his booth
5766556 but it was too dark and the officer could not see what was going on that this guy was threatening me with a gun
5766557 i had no money on me all they got was my id
5766558 i didnt do anything should the victim have to pay
5766559 i had kate winslet for match point to the last week in pre production when she said she couldnt do the picture because she had worked continually and had spent no time with her child
5766560 i was in a hole i had to get somebody fairly quickly and i knew that scarlett was a great actress and a beauty i didnt know if she was really what i had written though
5766561 i hired her and became totally captivated by her i thought she could simply do anything im very happy to work with her whenever there is a part that fits anything she could do i would always call her and hope that she would be available for it as i did with keaton for years i did that with mia i did many roles with her thought she was a wonderful actress and she never let me down i think that the same will be true with scarlett
5766562 when i first started i could never write for women
5766563 and when i used to write my cabaret act and i would write sketches for television i could never write for women i always wrote the male point of view people even commented about it at the time
5766564 then i got into 1972s play it again sam with diane keaton onstage
5766565 keaton and i started dating we started living together and became very close through some kind of socratic osmosis or something i started writing for women i started writing for diane and i found i could write for women then i sort of only wrote for women i wrote more and more for women and i wrote for them all the time for some reason i find them interesting to write about too men occasionally but really my heart is in it more when im writing for women i dont know why but i remember when that transformation took place from an inability to write a credible woman
5766566 a bonus of writing women is that there are so many wonderful actresses out there its much easier to get a woman for a role than it is a man
5766567 if you write a role there are always a couple of women you can get for it whereas with a guy if you dont get the one or two guys you want its not so easy there is a scarcity of guys really on that level there are so many gifted women out there that are just waiting for an opportunity to work
5766568 all the advice planning self help books anything you do dating services youve got to get lucky
5766569 if you do its great some people do but you can see by the divorce rate the amount of relationships people go through and the amount of people in unhappy relationships but stay together because of inertia because of children fear of loneliness there are very few really wonderful ones you have to get lucky
5766570 theres a drive that a lot of the people in this town have to surf
5766571 for the conditions we get i mean usually the waves are small in the wintertime when there is surf its accompanied by freezing weather freezing winds every single element possible against you being a surfer
5766572 if you really want to surf youve got to be on it every day theres waves its what you do
5766573 the statistics might show that the bad behavior by this years crop was no worse than last years but that is like saying suffering from a second rash is more agreeable than the first
5766574 whenever you get a super pack of guys out there its a limited resource you know
5766575 being from this area people figure hey i deserve this more than people from out of town thats just the way people look at it which is kind of childish if you ask me for the most part on the east coast were just happy to have waves
5766576 its turning into the west coast over here its almost a competition for a wave but if youre not that good youre not going to be able to compete with someone like vince out there
5766577 vince is the next kid coming out of our town that has a good looking future at it
5766578 hes doing it right too hes trying to compete as much as he can trying to get his name out there its tough because of how small the industry is here you have to travel and to travel you have to have money you have a lot of guys from small towns that just rip but they never break through because they never have the means to
5766579 you have to market yourself you have to tell your sponsors this is what im going to do for you im going to get these pictures in the papers its not necessarily the better you are at surfing but the more exposure you get theres way more of the business end behind it than i ever thought
5766580 and you do go away youre going to take full advantage of the whole time youre there its not like ill surf one time today then ill see what else is going on youre in the water all day long and youre just so amped
5766581 not as many reps and stuff all the kids here just surf to have fun more than in other places especially in huntington beach every kid there just wanted to be the next sponsored kid wanted to turn pro and stuff theres kids here that want to do that too but its just not the same here theyve got other things going on
5766582 when i was a little kid there were only like three traffic lights that turned red in ocean city in the winter all the other ones would be either off or blinking yellow it used to be like in the winter there was nobody in this town at all the less people the more you can really enjoy the town its like its really your town because theres no one there
5766583 the cool thing about summer is theres so many girls so many parties
5766584 its a crazy town in the summer but i really love the winter i like the isolation i dont like the big city i prefer the small town
5766585 the only part of your body thats showing is right here
5766586 through middle school and high school id always have a tan line in an oval on my face thats how you could tell who surfed and stuff through high school whoever had that tan line youd be like
5766587 i enjoyed it but i couldnt see the longevity for me it just was not my calling
5766588 less consistent but when its good ive had as much fun here as ive had anywhere when its good here its a lot of fun
5766589 forteeeeeee dont know i had a store called sunshine house up the street for 25 years and i sold that in 92 chaunceys opened in 94 so a long freaking time
5766590 ever since i can remember all i wanted to do was surf and i dont really know why my parents cant figure it out i cant trace it back to anything i got a paper route delivering the evening star when i was 10 or 11 years old and saved up enough money to buy a surfboard when i was 12 turns out my route manager at the paper route his son surfed so he would go to new jersey and play the ponies at monmouth park every week and would drop us off at the beach to go surfing i would rent a board this was before i got my first one and surf all day long and thats all i ever wanted to do i dont know why
5766591 my grandparents owned tostis deli on 130th i can never remember what street that is blair wheres that porn shop that sex shop
5766592 oh yeah they owned that italian deli in there that was awesome i used to go in there all the time when i lived on 136th street
5766593 its the bomb you probably met me in there at some point i used to work the register
5766594 i was in there all the time i loved it
5766595 if you look at the coast and the way its shaped we get way better waves than virginia beach way better than northern new jersey just because of the way its shaped we stick out farther
5766596 the really good surfers when the swell gets big they all head to assateague but ocean city is more consistent because it breaks on more tides whereas assateague is basically a low tide break but yeah because of assateague and because of the angle of our shores we catch more swell than other places other than hatteras which sticks out farther than we do
5766597 we get all our waves in the fall winter when no ones here
5766598 when we do get waves theres no one who sees them besides the surfers who know the waves are going to be there and come down
5766599 the best waves i got all year long were right here
5766600 i got out of a shithole and i came down to paradise
5766601 my father was the vice president of spalding worldwide i got into skating in 10th grade and quit everything i told my dad in 12th grade that i was going to be a professional skateboarder there was no pro anything he just looked at me like youre going to do what luckily it worked out
5766602 skating was done in the early 60s and late 50s into the 70s to emulate hawaiian surfers
5766603 but now skating has evolved so much that surfers are doing things on waves that the skateboarders were doing on ramps the tricks now being done by the pros on surfboards came from the skaters
5766604 the lifestyle sports bmx supercross surfing skateboarding all the x games stuff
5766605 its bad to have the people because its crowded but its good because it keeps me in business business is very very good
5766606 when youre in 30 degree water and its 10 degrees out and the winds blowing 20 knots youve got to really want to get in the water whereas i can be in tortola and its 80 degrees and the surfs perfect when theres good waves here theres good waves everywhere its fun to surf where theres palm trees
5766607 theres a lot of guys that surf from baltimore washington pennsylvania who have to do the weekend trips so they rely on our web site or the big forecasting sites and see if they want to come down for the weekend that technology has really helped surfers
5766608 a fun place to learn how to surf its a sand bottom beach break as opposed to a reef or rocks or a point break where theres a lot of currents or things like that its a beginner friendly place to surf
5766609 im worse now than i was when i was 18
5766610 back then when you got out of school it was kind of you put the kid stuff behind you and surfing was something you did as a kid which is ridiculous obviously
5766611 i realized that working in construction im not going to be able to leave a lot for my son but what i got from my dad he taught me to swim in the ocean he taught me to fish in the bay i kind of picked up surfing on my own but he taught me to body surf at 5 or 6 years old
5766612 i think i got his love for the ocean and the beach and i figure thats the one thing i can leave my son and my grandkids it all just kind of fell into place so i got back into it in the early 1980s and it has just consumed me more and more and im not the exception im maybe the one who admits it the loudest but there are a lot of guys you look around and youll see surfboard racks on every conceivable vehicle in this town
5766613 and it has to run itself its a huge economy and its an important piece of real estate that has to be protected
5766614 i think for most people there is a spiritual if not a religious connotation to surfing
5766615 when you go out there all you think about is what youre doing the workday and unfortunately the family all these things disappear you may sit there and talk to the guys around you but really youre in your world in the water

5766617 the conversion of hindus to islam happened over a period of time especially in the medieval period the people who embraced islam were not happy with hinduism which has a rigid system

5766767 in addition to serving as an excellent homeport for carnival for nearly 15 years new orleans is a one of a kind vacation destination and were delighted to continue our relationship with this wonderful city
5766768 the port and the entire new orleans tourism community is thrilled by carnivals decision to homeport the carnival triumph here

5766779 crudes just getting pulled up by heating oil it was a quick pop and technical triggers may have been hit
5766780 especially since there is a clear lack of buying momentum
5766781 weve all had two years to create a planning tool to move forward on developing the ninth street area in a way that respects and i might even say protects the character of ninth street a durham jewel as well as the surrounding neighborhoods
5766782 all of us have given up some of what we want
5766783 its a good foundation for moving forward for future policies for future decisions
5766784 we were disappointed by the decision of the planning commission we didnt get everything that we wanted
5766785 but with the compromise thats been proposed by the planning staff although we still didnt get everything that we wanted this process is never going to end if we dont get to a point where we cinch the top of the bag and move forward
5766786 what this plan proposes and what it would permit is the most dense housing in the city of durham
5766787 as a matter of fact it will require it and thats transit friendly
5766788 it also though promotes protecting that portion of ninth street those two business blocks that everybody loves and are the reason everybodys talking today
5766789 weve got to be careful to make a plan that we dont love this area to death
5766790 this morning i read a letter from a neighborhood representative and i was absolutely stunned at the tenor and content of what the individual had to say
5766791 i guess that due to our twenty five year history of remarkable generosity with free ninth street parking he thought we would let them go to the city and simply downzone our property
5766792 we have added to the vitality of ninth street in a way that in our opinion is in conjunction with the spirit that lives on both sides of the street
5766793 so where have we been weve been right here weve been providing what we could as good neighbors and have not asked the city for a dime nor did we request to have the properties downzoned
5766794 we believe that based on rising cost of fuel and the cost of infrastructure that therell be major shifts in where people choose to live in the triangle
5766795 theyll begin to want to live closer to their jobs we need to get those 50 of duke employees who live outside durham back into durham
5766796 now i really dont have a dog in this fight
5766797 if you go to the tta final environmental study they reference a us dept of transportation study that refers specifically to the inadequacy specifically of ninth street and other streets in downtown if there were to be high intensity development around the rail stations in those areas
5766798 the idea would be to get back with the neighborhoods and talk about the issues that we have with this current plan that has nothing to do with the two impending projects
5766799 its a tradeoff and were moving from the impossible in the zoning environment to the possible
5766800 and were not there yet and i must say i have friends and acquaintances on both sides of this issue
5766801 we could have a process that included public dialogue and public meetings and charrettes that went on for two years and then here we are here tonight
5766802 i dont know how that happened why here it appears to me at the last minute that youre raising issues that in my judgment should have been raised a year ago or six months ago
5766803 i gave the very same presentation at the planning commission
5766804 it might seem to you that there hasnt been any involvement but theres been a dramatic amount of involvement
5766805 you could never build anything there and have it succeed without parking
5766806 i hear that theyre not happy and that they want more than they got but i havent heard any indication of giving anything to get anything
5766807 theres an opportunity to do something on ninth street very very special
5766808 this is us simply saying we want to do something nice there i cant tell you if 35 or 55 work but whatever it is its going to be complementary to both sides of the street
5766809 if the old mill were to burn down which we dont want it to do we can build a 35 building there it would look ridiculous
5766810 i renovated the mill i own over 50 of that property
5766811 i just dont know that were going to get there
5766812 you see where treyburn is today i dont think we hurt ourselves by waiting 60 days
5766813 i value the fact that to date weve had a responsible developer sanford in this community
5766814 gene you alluded to the fact that they made an investment in probably something else brightleaf square that probably no one else would touch

5766817 if this was the reply of the people of moses in response to the atrocities by pharaoh of that time so is the response from servants of prophet muhammad sw to pharaoh of this age swear to god if our bodies tore into pieces and made them food of birds and if our bodies made into ashes and thrown into seawater even then each and every atom of our body part will raise the slogan of love for god and his prophet muhammad sw

5766819 pierre eksteen who is in charge of a school support network for children told reporters outside the deserted school grounds that satanic music was probably the cause of the attack
5766820 we know the wrong kind of music and drugs have bad effects young people need to be informed of the effects of bad satanic music

5766884 after just one bundesliga game it is very difficult to gauge the form of the players a few of them have returned later to full training following the european championships
5766885 there are new players in the squad from whom we expect to get a useful insight with regards to september we want to play with tempo and start the new season on the up
5766886 the priority is qualification but we also want to integrate some new players and not just in goal
5766887 the world cup in south africa is not that far away we need to start gaining points as soon as possible in order to reach our goal we will need to work hard in the coming weeks

5766903 i have breastfed kobi at the station and i have even expressed during district management meetings with my back turned in a room full of men so i did not miss any information
5766904 the men were great it has meant i could remain in top management and be a working mum 11 weeks after giving birth and not miss out on anything
5766905 they even accommodate me so i can take kobi overseas when i have to travel with work you could not ask for a better working environment
5766906 i had to kick my boss out of his office to express and it was such hard work making a real fist of it for both my job and my daughter
5766907 we are very sorry this has occurred we have an obligation to ensure all personal health information is kept secure and confidential and we currently cannot understand how this has occurred
5766908 changing the law would send an important message about community standards and about what the law expects
5766909 in particular there would be a reminder that consent has to be obtained on each separate occasion
5766910 victims and the public need to see that sexual violence is taken seriously that justice is being done and that this behaviour is not tolerated in our society
5766911 so just because it is hard to get convictions we do away with the standards a drunk consent is still consent
5766912 society perceives that there is a whole bunch of vindictive women out there waiting to get back at guys
5766913 stealing is always something which has most unfortunate consequences on a range of people in this instance it has consequences not only on the church but also the hundreds of people we are there for

5766915 some people would pay thousands to see this but we get to see it for free
5766916 she was going oh my head i just left her there
5766917 no amount of years he does in prison is worth a life
5766918 i had some alcohol in me i just reacted it wasnt supposed to happen
5766919 she just said dont i told her to get into the bus thats when she started stumbling i pulled her up into the old bus she just dropped where she was she was going oh my head i just left her there
5766920 he wasnt the tough guy he always just kind of had an evil soul
5766921 i thought it was all over i quite literally thought she was going to kill me
5766922 i was trying to get up but i couldnt and then i saw my arm break as the hoof went through
5766923 there was no one around and i was calling out but i dont think anyone could have done anything anyway
5766924 if it had been a child or an elderly person they wouldnt have stood a chance i think generally it is safe but there are times when a cow can become on edge and thats when its dangerous
5766925 but this is an unfortunate incident and we are very sorry he has been injured
5766926 its very annoying but its part of the nature of the cows to protect their calves
5766927 and new zealand law says that women can have their breasts out in public or be bare chested just like a man

5766930 its a bit of a display that says a mans life is about motors and boobs
5766931 we are prepared to go to a meeting with all the agencies and slap a file on a desk and say take out of it what you want and hell yes it is making a difference
5766932 in the past we would not have taken that step now we say you can see the situation clearly we dont care if its the weekend and a bean counter has said wait till monday just get that kid out now
5766933 we dont expect the police or other government agencies to share our information without a good reason for doing so for example it may be necessary to disclose information to avert a threat to someones safety
5766934 you can have all the rules about silence that you like but if that child is still at risk what good is that it is about that childs safety
5766935 a mongrel mob member a convicted murderer said to me this is the most evil valley in new zealand it is where you kill your kids
5766936 it made me think hard about the area we live in and even more determined to make it a safer place for our children especially
5766937 there will be drinking along with theme cars and costumes
5766938 all the undie 500 does is cause us a considerable amount of grief
5766939 its bad for the city dunedin bad for our reputation and we dont need it
5766940 we believe were well prepared we certainly have a significant number of staff rostered on this weekend
5766941 we have been working really hard this year to protect the undie 500 name and we dont want to compromise that at all
5766942 its still our students and were trying to make sure they dont go down
5766943 people have just said since this was cancelled everyone will still go
5766944 there is still a group organising it who knows who it is
5766945 if students want to put their future careers at risk by indulging in something like this then thats their choice
5766946 if they conduct themselves in a way that is unlawful then the police are ready
5766947 we deplore any anti social and illegal behaviour and would like to remind students of the consequences this can have in their personal and professional lives
5766948 whatever the situation the safety and wellbeing of students and staff are paramount

5766994 wir haben mit einem 32er raster gespielt und damit eine gute qualit t an spielern gehabt

5767005 most assuredly i say to you moses did not give you the bread from heaven but my father gives you the true bread from heaven
5767006 then they said to him lord give us this bread always and jesus said to them

5767014 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5767015 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5767016 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5767017 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5767018 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5767019 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5767020 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5767021 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5767022 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5767023 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5767024 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5767025 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5767026 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5767027 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5767028 is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions

5767036 let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation

5767040 how then can man be justified with god or how can he be clean that is born of a woman
5767041 thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind it is abomination
5767042 if a man lie with mankind as he lieth with a woman both of them have committed an abomination they shall surely be put to death their blood shall be upon them
5767043 and if a man lie with a beast he shall surely be put to death and ye shall slay the beast
5767044 god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man
5767045 and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham
5767046 for i am merciful saith the lord and i will not keep anger forever
5767047 ye have kindled a fire in mine anger which shall burn forever thus saith the lord
5767048 if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true
5767049 i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved
5767050 and i god will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back parts
5767051 why do you preach hate because the bible preaches hate for every one verse about gods mercy love compassion etc there are two verses about his vengeance hatred wrath etc

5767059 as with many other areas of his record scott garretts environmental record is simply shameful
5767060 from dealing with sinkholes and sludge to clean air and clean water garrett has proven time and time again he cant be bothered with the environmental safety of his constituents and he cant be trusted with the energy concerns of this country as illustrated by the admirable scores of garretts republican colleagues what matters is not whether an idea is democratic or republican but whether it is good for the country scott garretts record reveals that he is part of the special interest culture of corruption in washington that is endangering the safety and prosperity of our state and country

5767185 while we are making a lot of improvements the mobileme service is still not up to our standards
5767186 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same times as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
5767187 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence

5767194 why are all these illegal immigrants coming to arizona whats fueling their need to come here i abhor illegal activity as much as anyone but how are you going to find and deport a mass humanity of people who are living under the radar

5767196 we should go back to keynesian economics rebuilding our infrastructure has a multiplying effect on jobs and earnings we dont have much choice somethings got to be done before more bridges fall down
5767197 corporations now function as a shadow government not elected and not representative they need to be regulated now
5767198 the democratic party has always been the large umbrella this is the party of fannie lou hamer in 1964 fannie lou hamer the daughter of a sharecropper stood in front of the democratic national convention credentials committee and demanded that black people be admitted as mississippi delegates to the 64 convention and now this same party will put into nomination the name of the man who i hope will be elected the first black president of the united states

5767205 there are constant reports of security breaches and certainly thats cause for concern

5767229 tijdens het inspreken van de stemmen ben je letterlijk in een leeg pakhuis met overal cameras om je heen je moet de hele wereld levend maken in je hoofd ik speel scrooge op vier verschillende leeftijden je moet je dan zowel vocaal als fysiek aanpassen het ene moment spreek je met een engels accent en het volgende moment weer met een ierse
5767230 it was the greatest feeling ive ever had the greatest decision i ever made was to go there obviously its a top notch college program i faced some pretty stellar athletes and guys throughout that system i learned a lot definitely growing as a player each year just being with guys who are already in the big leagues huston street j p howell curtis thigpen just watching them work i really learned a lot
5767231 alex gordon he was a nebraska guy and he was the number two pick we went to long beach one year and i faced evan longoria whos obviously doing real well for himself just to name a few theres a lot of big names out there but those are the only ones i can think of off the top of my head right now
5767232 it was awesome it was a once in a lifetime thing and i wish we could have done it again but the experience i got from that pitching in front of a big crowd of like 20 22 000 people out there i just gained all that knowledge with having success and i go back to that mindset every time that im out there on the mound
5767233 it was just one of those things ive been waiting for for a long time the year before i got drafted by the cardinals in the 36th but i went back to school because i had another year but that day i was just waiting for that phone call like every other guy i was very fortunate to be taken by the nationals in the eighth round and im very happy to be where im at right now
5767234 the cardinals when they took me that one year id kind of thought that i was going to go earlier than that and figured i wasnt going to go back to school but when the nationals took me i was very excited i worked hard in the fall and in the spring and im just glad the hard work paid off
5767235 yeah thats something you do in the dynasty in mlb laughs but things have been going great for me ive worked hard and ive always been one of those guys that thought hard work pays off and im having fun while im at it a lot of guys might take it a little bit too seriously but the main thing about it is youve got to have fun while youre playing ball thats the main thing im doing here and it helps a lot to have a coaching staff that allows you to do that my teammates these guys are amazing we play as a team theres no individual basis things around here it feels like im back in college just throwing to wood bats
5767236 im not a guy thats going to go in there and overpower anybody i top out at 92 or so i do throw a lot of offspeed pitches and i tend to get guys off balance im kind of a bulldog competitor out there on the mound im going to work hard every inning and im just going to go out there and do my work its nothing special its just getting after it every inning every pitch
5767237 thats something thats up to the front office obviously you want to make it up there as quick as you can if i keep producing the way i am i figure everything will play out the way i want it to
5767238 maar ik hoopte dat ze van school getrapt was of aan de harddrugs zat

5767258 obamas sic comprehensive agenda to empower individuals with disabilities fits in with the campaigns overarching message of equalizing opportunities for all americans
5767259 in 2006 working age americans with disabilities were almost three times more likely to live below the poverty line than those without disabilities while the average annual household income of individuals in the united states without disabilities was 65 400 in 2006 the average annual household income for people with disabilities was 36 300 and the employment rate for persons with disabilities in 2006 was at least 40 points lower than the employment rate of working age individuals without disabilities these dismal statistics offer evidence of severe shortcomings in our countrys efforts to break down the barriers that exclude people with disabilities and deprive them of true equality of opportunity and independence

5767296 represents a generations disenchantment with statism and its return to eternal truths and fundamental values
5767297 it was that death of the will which communism with great cunning always tries to induce in its victims
5767298 the crisis of communism exists to the degree in which it has failed to free the peoples that it rules from god nobody knows this better than the communist party of the soviet union the crisis of the western world exists to the degree in which it is indifferent to god it exists to the degree in which the western world actually shares communisms materialist vision is so dazzled by the logic of the materialist interpretation of history politics and economics that it fails to grasp that for it the only possible answer to the communist challenge faith in god or faith in man is the challenge faith in god
5767299 a communist breaks because he must choose at last between irreconcilable opposites god or man soul or mind freedom or communism
5767300 religion and freedom are indivisible without freedom the soul dies without the soul there is no justification for freedom
5767301 that is why communism is the central experience of the first half of the 20th century and may be its final experience will be unless the free world in the agony of its struggle with communism overcomes its crisis by discovering in suffering and pain a power of faith which will provide mans mind at the same intensity with the same two certainties a reason to live and a reason to die if it fails this will be the century of the great social wars if it succeeds this will be the century of the great wars of faith
5767302 copernicus and his successors displaced man as the central fact of the universe by proving that the earth was not the central star of the universe communism restores man to his sovereignty by the simple method of denying god
5767303 the communist vision is the vision of man without god
5767304 the revolutionary heart of communism is not the theatrical appeal workers of the world unite
5767305 the world has reached that turning point by the steep stages of a crisis mounting for generations the turning point is the next to the last step it was reached in blood sweat tears havoc and death in world war ii the chief fruit of the first world war was the russian revolution and the rise of communism as a national power the chief fruit of the second world war was our arrival at the next to the last step of the crisis with the rise of communism as a world power history is likely to say that these were the only decisive results of the world wars the last war simplified the balance of political forces in the world by reducing them to two for the first time it made the power of the communist sector of mankind embodied in the soviet union roughly equal to the power of the free sector of mankind embodied in the united states it made the collision of these powers all but inevitable for the world wars did not end the crisis they raised its tensions to a new pitch they raised the crisis to a new stage all the politics of our time including the politics of war will be the politics of this crisis few men are so dull that they do not know that the crisis exists and that it threatens their lives at every point it is popular to call it a social crisis it is in fact a total crisis religious moral intellectual social political economic it is popular to call it a crisis of the western world it is in fact a crisis of the whole world communism which claims to be a solution of the crisis is itself a symptom and an irritant of the crisis
5767306 well i dont believe that climate change is just an issue thats convenient to bring up during a campaign i believe its one of the greatest moral challenges of our generation thats why ive fought successfully in the senate to increase our investment in renewable fuels thats why i reached across the aisle to come up with a plan to raise our fuel standards and i didnt just give a speech about it in front of some environmental audience in california i went to detroit i stood in front of a group of automakers and i told them that when i am president there will be no more excuses we will help them retool their factories but they will have to make cars that use less oil

5767319 here i am sitting at a comfortable table loaded heavily with books with one eye on my typewriter and the other on licorice the cat who has a great fondness for carbon paper and i am telling you that the emperor napoleon was a most contemptible person but should i happen to look out of the window down upon seventh avenue and hear the sound of heavy drums and see the little man on his white horse in his old and much worn green uniform then i dont know but i am afraid that i would leave my books and the kitten and my home and everything else to follow him wherever he cared to lead my own grandfather did this and heaven knows he was not born to be a hero
5767320 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5767321 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5767322 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5767323 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5767324 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5767325 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5767326 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5767327 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5767328 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5767329 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5767330 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5767331 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

5767333 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5767334 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5767335 can operate on batteries and fit comfortably in a pocket purse or briefcase now not only can people avoid getting lost while walking but they can discover points of interest within walking distance of their hotel to further help them make the most of their business trips
5767336 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5767337 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5767338 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5767339 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5767340 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5767341 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5767342 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5767343 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5767344 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5767345 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5767346 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5767347 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5767348 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5767349 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5767350 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5767351 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5767352 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5767353 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5767354 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5767355 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5767356 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5767357 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5767358 lets go on a road trip instead lets go camping
5767359 if they cannot agree on the restoration of the judges in a matter of days then clearly something is not right with the coalition
5767360 we cannot afford to lose months or even weeks on these political issues they need to get to the economy and only a strong government can take the tough decisions needed for the economy
5767361 we have been assigned to reach a consensus on the situation within the next 72 hours
5767362 he resigned himself and as far as his accountability is concerned coalition partners will decide
5767363 if they cannot agree on the restoration of the judges in a matter of days then clearly something is not right with the coalition
5767364 we cannot afford to lose months or even weeks on these political issues they need to get to the economy and only a strong government can take the tough decisions needed for the economy
5767365 the next one month will be a key period for the government
5767366 they need to restore confidence before the rally in markets can be sustained
5767367 the international community would like to see a respectable exit for the president
5767368 satisfaction from the international community will influence future foreign flows
5767369 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5767370 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5767371 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5767372 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5767373 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5767374 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5767375 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5767376 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5767377 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5767378 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5767379 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5767380 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5767381 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5767382 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5767383 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5767384 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5767385 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5767386 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5767387 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5767388 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5767389 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5767390 tem que ter disposi o tem que ter habilidade porque s o cinco velocidades
5767391 are you totally taking my place in 2nd and 3rd
5767392 yeh i thought it was just going to be once and a while but then they called me back and gave me the whole job
5767393 our countrys greatest military asset is the men and women who wear the uniform of the united states when we do send our men and women into harms way we must also clearly define the mission prescribe concrete political and military objectives seek out advice of our military commanders evaluate the intelligence plan accordingly and ensure that our troops have the resources support and equipment they need to protect themselves and fulfill their mission
5767394 relying upon a restrictive and disconnected set of legal authorities
5767395 other units and capabilities that remain in chronic short supply
5767396 invest in foreign language training cultural awareness and human intelligence and other needed counterinsurgency and stabilization skill sets
5767397 create a more robust capacity to train equip and advise foreign security forces so that local allies are better prepared to confront mutual threats
5767398 establish predictability in deployments so that active duty and reserves know what they can and must expect
5767399 vitally needed equipment to our soldiers sailors airmen and marines before lives are lost
5767400 preserve our unparalleled airpower capabilities to deter and defeat any conventional competitors swiftly respond to crises across the globe and support our ground forces
5767401 recapitalize our naval forces replacing aging ships and modernizing existing platforms which provide the backbone of our ability to extend global power
5767402 support missile defense but ensure that it is developed in a way that is pragmatic and cost effective and most importantly does not divert resources from other national security priorities until we are positive the technology will protect the american public
5767403 restore american leadership on space issues seeking a worldwide ban on weapons that interfere with military and commercial satellites
5767404 okay well leave your space stuff alone so that you may continue to dominate the world militarily
5767405 build up the capacity of each non pentagon agency to deploy personnel and area experts where they are needed to help move soldiers sailors airmen and marines out of civilian roles
5767406 set a goal of creating a national cac of 25 000 personnel with special skill sets doctors lawyers engineers city planners agriculture specialists police etc that would provide each federal agency with a pool of volunteer experts willing to deploy in times of need at home and abroad
5767407 must be transformed and strengthened including on common security concerns like afghanistan homeland security and counterterrorism
5767408 expand humanitarian activities that build friends and allies at the regional and local level such as during the response to the tsunami in south and southeast asia and win hearts and minds in the process
5767409 corruption and cost overruns that have become all too routine in defense contracting
5767410 acquisition reform and management end ing the common practice of no bid contracting
5767411 end the abuse of supplemental budgets by creating a system of oversight for war funds as stringent as in the regular budget
5767412 and i dream your dream for you and now your dream is real
5767413 hows america cnn mouths cafferty jack workin programs cafferty cnns
5767414 without the billions raised by mr pecunious and many of the other prominent members of w e a l t h i never could have done it as president i will continue to make sure that those americans who have worked hard have studied hard and have actually earned the money they deserve keep it the american dream is possible and its time to live it or be left behind
5767415 i dont know how this party of the people this last light of hope for the impoverished will ever stand a chance unless something is done about political campaign finance reform we cannot compete in an environment that allows the voice of the wealthy to be heard shouted from the rooftops of the corporate owned media while the whispers of the oppressed are muffled by rags in the sewers of our streets we must not tolerate a system that allows one party to transport their supporters to the polls in luxury transportation en masse while we are left with no other option than to use dilapidated buses travelling over pot hole riddled streets into war zone neighborhoods where the residents are fearful to even leave their homes
5767416 this cannot possibly be what the framers of our constitution had intended when they promised all americans the right to participate in the electoral process
5767417 that promise has been broken and it is up to us to fix it i will continue to do battle for those who cannot fight for themselves for those who can barely put food on their tables for those who believe that they matter too its time however for those that have the will for those who know how to fight for those who are strong to join me in a new revolution i thank the power party for giving us the right to bear arms for eliminating background checks for allowing those of us with resolve to take this country back

5767419 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5767420 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5767421 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5767422 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5767423 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5767424 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5767425 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5767426 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5767427 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5767428 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5767429 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5767430 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5767431 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5767432 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5767433 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5767434 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5767435 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5767436 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5767437 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

5767440 in the third book of this work c 5 we made a passing reference to this question but did not decide whether angels inasmuch as they are spirits could have bodily intercourse with women for it is written who makes his angels spirits that is he makes those who are by nature spirits his angels by appointing them to the duty of bearing his messages for the greek word which in latin appears as angelus means a messenger but whether the psalmist speaks of their bodies when he adds and his min isters a flaming fire or means that gods ministers ought to blaze with love as with a spiritual fire is doubtful however the same trustworthy scripture testifies that angels have appeared to men in such bodies as could not only be seen but also touched there is too a very general rumor which many have verified by their own experience or which trustworthy persons who have heard the experience of others corroborate that sylvans and fauns who are commonly called incubi had often made wicked assaults upon women and satisfied their lust upon them and that certain devils called duses by the gauls are constantly attempting and effecting this impurity is so generally affirmed that it were impudent to deny it from these assertions indeed i dare not determine whether there be some spirits embodied in an aerial substance for this element even when agitated by a fan is sensibly felt by the body and who are capable of lust and of mingling sensibly with women but certainly i could by no means believe that gods holy angels could at that time have so fallen nor can i think that it is of them the apostle peter said for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment 2 peter 2 4 i think he rather speaks of these who first apostatized from god along with their chief the devil who enviously deceived the first man under the form of a serpent but the same holy scripture affords the most ample testimony that even godly men have been called angels for of john it is written behold i send my messenger angel before your face who shall prepare your way mark 1 2 and the prophet malachi by a peculiar grace specially communicated to him was called an angel malachi 2 7
5767441 let us omit then the fables of those scriptures which are called apocryphal because their obscure origin was unknown to the fathers from whom the authority of the true scriptures has been transmitted to us by a most certain and well ascertained succession for though there is some truth in these apocryphal writings yet they contain so many false statements that they have no canonical authority we cannot deny that enoch the seventh from adam left some divine writings for this is asserted by the apostle jude in his canonical epistle but it is not without reason that these writings have no place in that canon of scripture which was preserved in the temple of the hebrew people by the diligence of successive priests for their antiquity brought them under suspicion and it was impossible to ascertain whether these were his genuine writings and they were not brought forward as genuine by the persons who were found to have carefully preserved the canonical books by a successive transmission so that the writings which are produced under his name and which contain these fables about the giants saying that their fathers were not men are properly judged by prudent men to be not genuine just as many writings are produced by heretics under the names both of other prophets and more recently under the names of the apostles all of which after careful examination have been set apart from canonical authority under the title of apocrypha there is therefore no doubt that according to the hebrew and christian canonical scriptures there were many giants before the deluge and that these were citizens of the earthly society of men and that the sons of god who were according to the flesh the sons of seth sunk into this community when they forsook righteousness nor need we wonder that giants should be born even from these for all of their children were not giants but there were more then than in the remaining periods since the deluge and it pleased the creator to produce them that it might thus be demonstrated that neither beauty nor yet size and strength are of much moment to the wise man whose blessedness lies in spiritual and immortal blessings in far better and more enduring gifts in the good things that are the peculiar property of the good and are not shared by good and bad alike it is this which another prophet confirms when he says these were the giants famous from the beginning that were of so great stature and so expert in war those did not the lord choose neither gave he the way of knowledge unto them but they were destroyed because they had no wisdom and perished through their own foolishness
5767442 why would the democratic party possibly want to limit the united states access to oil
5767443 drilling in anwr the lies told by the democratic party and what they dont want you to know
5767444 remember when al gore said that the government should work to artificially raise gas prices to 5 00 a gallon
5767445 our main concern is that they are safe and they are in a safe environment and a lot of that deals with communication
5767446 i think the rule is good because thats for safety purpose
5767447 if it comes down to a safety issue and having them learn english is the only way we can have people safely on an incident then yes we would be forced to hire english speaking firefighters
5767448 thoughtless reasons for why one language should be the case
5767449 why should i have to learn english you need to learn to speak spanish
5767450 it is a decision we made a while ago and we are going to stick to it
5767451 but in this country spain small sports live on scholarships and in this country scholarships are paid after the fact based on your results it means giving up a very important sum of money

5767471 the georgian peacekeeping contingent was given the task to stop and obstruct the advancement of russian forces through the roki tunnel should they try to help the peacekeeping group
5767472 for this purpose they stockpiled arms by various means which could be used to arrange a bloodbath and obstruct the movement of any convoys in both the tunnel and the mountain pass

5767517 thats a decision an analysis ill have to reflect on i think weve had a productive two and a half years but i do think that has slowed somewhat in recent weeks
5767518 hes not sure when hell do that because he hasnt got good enough polls
5767519 i dont think thats a particularly responsible position we cant judge the polls polls may indicate i think polls do indicate that the next election will in all likelihood be a minority one way or the other
5767520 i believe the place should be cleaned out there is a freezer full of carcasses and the owners have to pay to get it cleaned

5767552 the remaining contingent that was used to reinforce the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the territory of south ossetia and to russia
5767553 of course there was a great symbolism to them doing this at the senaki base
5767554 in their eyes senaki was a bit of nato that they just dont want to see in georgia
5767555 the buildings the arms all gone if you consider that this is one of the few such modern bases we have this was very important for us
5767556 we will not leave a single barrel a single cartridge for georgia which initiated this bloodshed and shot at our peacekeepers and civilians in south ossetia
5767557 the conflict indicated theyre far from being able to sustain a serious conflict they more or less disintegrated
5767558 we must also make sure that no military threat comes from bordering areas
5767559 russia has sent a strong message to the west that it is seeking recognition of its interest in the former soviet union
5767560 there needs to be a lot of reconsideration including on the american side about what went wrong

5767596 nog wel een paar bieren zou binnen doen toen we dus gisteren terugkwamen van rijsel en langs de auchan vestiging op zon drie minuten van de vlaams zuid vlaamse grens passeerden maakte ik van de gelegenheid gebruik om een nieuw voorraadje in te slaan
5767597 cider en deze keer ook voorzien van een fles absenthe was een brasserie grain dorge in ronchin op een tiental kilometers van rijsel waarvan ik vorige keer la g ante kocht
5767598 het blonde moulins dascq 6 2 dus mee naar huis maar de brouwerij heeft ook nog een amberkleurig biertje een witbier een kerstbier n een tripel in huis
5767599 so much of todays market is driven by distress unless interpreted in that context the stats give a rather distorted view of the overall market
5767600 if youre in an emergency room youre there to be treated you cant just sit and be neglected
5767601 our preliminary review shows the patient was treated promptly and appropriately
5767602 i was speaking to the officers monday and i know that they feel very vulnerable i know that they feel really quite sad that people dont see them yet as human beings
5767603 the device was an old type of device that had been used previously in the ira campaign and we believe at this point in time it had probably been stored since then and malfunctioned possibly because it hadnt been stored in very good conditions
5767604 if you have an apple and i have an apple and we exchange apples then you and i will still each have one apple but if you have an idea and i have an idea and we exchange these ideas then each of us will have two ideas

5767607 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5767608 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5767609 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5767610 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5767611 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5767612 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5767613 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5767614 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5767615 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5767616 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5767617 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5767618 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5767619 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5767620 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5767621 modern technology has made people lazy it has even got to the point where employees prefer to send each other emails to someone sitting in the same room just so they dont have to engage in a spoken conversation
5767622 this over reliance on technology is taking away the social side of peoples jobs and leaving workers too lazy to bother with exercise
5767623 its no reassurance to me that i was there at her final moments theres not much reassurance anywhere
5767624 she was the better half of me and now my better half is gone im totally devastated

5767636 eu cred ca e mai mult pentru piata dezvoltatorilor locali pentru ca produsele noastre nu se incadreaza in pret
5767637 piata romaneasca ramane in continuare axata pe achizitia de hardware in 2007 mai mult de 77 dintre cheltuielile cu it au fost directionate catre hardware in special in verticalele sectorului public administratie educatie si sanatate care beneficiaza de un aflux important de fonduri europene si care sunt subinformatizate

5767641 falling in love with someone is that point where you just get to know them and if you really like them theyll seem like perfection then overtime you start to notice that they have flaws just like you and any other person and if its meant to be love you love them because of those flaws so the real difference is seeing perfection and seeing every flaw
5767642 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us
5767643 cold when i am denied it your light is ultraviolet
5767644 its an area that has huge differences in ethnicity and language and even religion so its an area that has a potential to always be a turmoil point in georgia in particular as they were transitioning from a soviet style economy to a market style econ there were a lot of problems it remains a very poor state outside the main provincial capital and tblisi itself
5767645 the basis for our leave to appeal is that the case is of national importance that there are some significant flaws in mr justice blairs logic with the greatest of respect and that there is a senior appellate court that takes a different view of the matter than the ontario court of appeal
5767646 well go ahead with the renovation of gentilly 2 because its a plant that has been used safely for 25 years
5767647 the site of the plant is very safe as much for production as for storing nuclear waste
5767648 the government has had a policy that wont accept a used fuel waste site in quebec
5767649 today however they have given the okay to producing more radioactive waste thats hypocritical

5767691 really strongly that we were defrauded and that a large portion of the industry was
5767692 that kind of unethical business behaviour has to stop and were going to stand up and do something about it in the end we feel really strongly about the complaint and that its going to move in a very positive way for us and it continues to do so
5767693 we silicon knights were the first to jump up and say that the emperor has no clothes thats for sure we feel really strongly about it
5767694 i dont see him as a county executive i see him as a force of nature
5767695 if joe d has done anything its build the best team in the state
5767696 were strong in the suburbs where divincenzo resides and strong in newark which is where joe was born and raised
5767697 there are a lot more things i want to accomplish as county executive
5767698 were all focused on whats happening with making turtleback zoo self sufficient and finishing the county courthouse complex which will be the best in the state
5767699 if corzine doesnt run would i be interested down the road possibly in running possibly
5767700 joe d is a great friend and we had a blast both in the primary and general that year
5767701 but there were issues there he comes out and announces a month before the election that just wasnt enough time then this thing with his wife serving as a placeholder for his congressional seat while he ran for u s senate didnt help him
5767702 hes done an outstanding job as us attorney and hed be a strong candidate for the republican party if he decides to run
5767703 ive got important relationship with both of them christie and corzine
5767704 corzine has helped with state money i wouldnt be able to make the needed changes to our infrastructure without him and after the last two county executives from this very office went to jail christie has helped with ethics hes really helped shape this office
5767705 i think he really enjoys being u s attorney and if mccain wins he may stay on
5767706 chris christie is the republicans strongest candidate but i dont know if he really wants it i would love him to turn democrat
5767707 i absolutely endorse the team they really represent the district
5767708 we work well together but in terms of mayor its going to take some time he has to develop a good team around him and i dont think hes there yet whatever other obligations he has thats fine but he needs a good team here to take care of business
5767709 all that hard work you put in for the first game will completely migrate over to the second game itll be something that gamers wont have to worry about starting a new character or anything like that
5767710 story is really going to evolve over the trilogy but it is what i would encompassed
5767711 so if you took the story on its own then its encapsulated but there are a few arcs that dont get resolved because we do have to have them resolved over the trilogy thats the way it works
5767712 voy a tener pechos lindos hasta los 90 a os

5767714 as que esa fue la decisi n que tom y fue una dif cil
5767715 a veces lloro y a veces grito y me pongo realmente furiosa y a veces me revuelco en autocompasi n
5767716 creo que todo eso es parte de sanar y a todas las personas que est n pasando por eso les digo que est bien llorar est bien echarse al suelo y gritar si quieren hacerlo
5767717 me encanta vivir y realmente amo mi vida y supe que desde este momento en adelante s lo iba a estar bien

5767722 this was the right ending to conclude the olympic games
5767723 this was a major group of terrorists in suicide bomber form an attack on the coalition forces base and it was a major operation of the afghan national army commandos who succeeded in eliminating 10 suicide bombers before they could do anything
5767724 in its fight against terrorism france has been dealt a harsh blow
5767725 my determination is intact france is resolved to pursue the struggle against terrorism for democracy and freedom
5767726 the initial patrol was reinforced with quick reaction forces close air support and mobile medical teams
5767727 during the engagement a large number of insurgents were killed
5767728 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5767729 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5767730 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5767731 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5767732 so far its going good we have power and everything its just been windy and rainy
5767733 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day
5767734 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5767735 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5767736 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5767737 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5767738 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5767739 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5767740 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5767741 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5767742 i think it was just towards the end mark opened the door for me a couple of times
5767743 i really struggled putting but i kept hitting a lot of greens and making a lot of pars
5767744 i wish i could say i made five birdies coming in or something like that but i was just staying consistent making pars and mark had a couple of bad breaks towards the end
5767745 it would be nice if you went out and made a lot of birdies but if you cant you dont want to give away holes by making bogeys and double bogeys
5767746 youve got to at least tie holes if youre not making birdies at wait for your opportunities to do things
5767747 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5767748 i dont think it would be productive for our football team you have to be a productive part to be an nfl player and theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right theres a lot that comes with being an nfl football player
5767749 the bengals tried for an extended period of time to support chris and his potentially bright career we had hoped to guide him toward an appropriate standard of personal responsibility that this community would support and that would allow him to play in the nfl but those efforts end today as we move on with what is best for our team
5767750 im just glad theyre willing to let the past be the past and give him a chance
5767751 i just hope that the cincinnati fans will give him the same type of chance
5767752 we practiced hard and we were quite organized but we just didnt play enough games
5767753 when youre only playing against one team it kind of made it difficult to prepare against teams that use other systems
5767754 we did the best that we could and we all had fun at it
5767755 the saskatchewan soccer association was very pleased with how the tournament was organized and how smoothly things went
5767756 conducted training for cinema staff to identify camcorders and prepped enforcement officers with basic knowledge of copyright law and to identify pirated products all around asia

5767759 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5767760 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5767761 ensure russia does not learn the wrong lessons from the events of the last two weeks
5767762 force cannot be the basis for the demarcation of new lines around russia
5767763 but now russias actions have turned even the doves into hawks

5767791 y aunque aseguraron que los efectivos ya hab an sido liberados no pudieron explicar por qu no se les hab a devuelto las mochilas y escudos
5767792 el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos estar n all hasta que se solucione el problema prefieren morir all no tienen miedo
5767793 son manejados por un grupo de abogados que adrede les informan mal
5767794 queremos dar soluci n al justo reclamo de estos pueblos porque el gobierno sigue actuando con mucha arrogancia y no tiene capacidad de di logo
5767795 el problema de fondo es que el gobierno intenta ver a los ind genas como unos pobres m s sin admitir que tienen otra manera de vivir una visi n cultural distinta
5767796 no tienen que ser vistos como seres inferiores por no permitir el ingreso de inversiones privadas a sus territorios lo que pasa es que al per le cuesta ver la diferencia cultural como un valor una riqueza la ven como un obst culo
5767797 algunas organizaciones no gubernamentales que est n trabajando en el tema est n levantando a la gente para que haga este tipo de cosas que en el fondo es un acto subversivo porque se est n yendo contra los cimientos de la democracia
5767798 c mo han logrado el milagro de poder reagrupar en un solo d a y lugar a poblaciones tan dispersas como son las selv ticas habr que investigar
5767799 el per que en d cadas atr s en los a os 70 estaba en la vanguardia en lo que concierne al tema ind gena ahora aparece en el ltimo lugar en la lista
5767800 puede que estas protestas terminen en un di logo pero el problema va a seguir porque no existen pol ticas de estado que valoren y respeten a los ind genas
5767801 ser a irrisorio equiparar el precio de la nafta a los valores internacionales
5767802 para entender los incrementos en los precios de las naftas hay que hacer un poco de memoria al 12 de enero de 2008 cuando por una decisi n del secretario de comercio interior guillermo moreno tuvimos que retrotraer los precios a los de octubre de 2007 lo hicimos con el compromiso pactado de palabra con el gobierno nacional de que a medida que fueran pasando los d as y meses y seg n los n meros que iba a ir tirando el instituto nacional de estad stica y censos indec el precio del combustible iba a ir subiendo
5767803 de este porcentaje los estacioneros tuvieron que hacerse cargo de los gastos de comercializaci n dentro de los cuales iban incluidos los costos fijos que en algunos casos hab an aumentado hasta en un 240
5767804 no ten amos rentabilidad para sostener en el tiempo la fuente de trabajo por eso la nica herramienta que tuvimos la chance de colocar fue el cargo adicional por gastos de comercializaci n pero ste era un arreglo de palabra con el gobierno nacional para empezar a subir el combustible paulatinamente muy despacio
5767805 los costos fijos de una estaci n de servicio han aumentado mucho m s
5767806 no creo que hayan aumentado m s del porcentaje que le haya permitido el gobierno nacional no discuto que haya disparidad dentro de distintas banderas siempre el que marc el rumbo del precio para el consumidor fue repsol ypf de ah en adelante las otras petroleras se acomodan al precio de acuerdo a los costos que tengan
5767807 el 25 est en manos de argentinos del grupo eskenazi que tiene un arreglo con el gobierno para empezar a tener un poco de control del precio del combustible dentro del mercado interno
5767808 desde el 2000 se deben haber cerrado cerca de 2 000 estaciones de servicio esto es un claro ndice de que no se pueden mantener entonces tienen que recurrir a una herramienta para poder sostener la fuente de trabajo
5767809 mientras tengamos un barril de petr leo alto inaccesible para algunas petroleras para destilar o producir m s nafta van a seguir subiendo
5767810 las petroleras tienen otras herramientas de trabajo para poder mantener dentro de lo que resta de 2008 el precio del combustible
5767811 habiendo mantenido constantes los factores que en ocasiones anteriores confluyeron para la creaci n del fuego paneles media sombra y p blico que hab a dado muestras de su afici n a la pirotecnia chab n carec a de motivos razonables para confiar en que no se producir a nuevamente un episodio de tales caracter sticas
5767812 chab n no es responsable de la tragedia y vamos a demostrar que el incendio fue intencional despu s del recital se secuestraron m s de 50 artefactos de pirotecnia pero si nadie hubiera tirado las bengalas esto no hubiera ocurrido
5767813 el responsable de la habilitaci n y todas esas cuestiones era la firma central park a la que chab n le alquilaba el local el s lo organizaba recitales
5767814 est de buen estado de nimo pero con mucha ansiedad cu nto m s se acerca la fecha m s ansioso se pone ya me dijo que quiere asistir a todas las audiencias
5767815 no hay dudas de que el hecho se trata de un estrago doloso pero las defensas van a tratar de que la figura sea culposa para que sea excarcelable
5767816 en este juicio la lucha va a estar entre el dolo y la culpa pero los familiares quieren justicia y una condena efectiva para todos los imputados
5767817 no implica ni alcanza como consecuencia necesaria la muerte de los all presentes
5767818 la habituaci n al riesgo pudo haber influido negativamente en la representaci n que pudo haberse hecho de las probabilidades ciertas de que el peligro efectivamente se produzca
5767819 ellos eran m sicos que iban solamente a tocar y no entend an nada de seguridad ni de habilitaciones por lo que nunca se iban a imaginar que sus recitales iba a haber un incendio
5767820 even if you throw all the money in the world in youre still going to have the gap

5767864 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed

5767947 if we would stand up and be counted on the side of reason we ought to drop terms like pseudoscience and unscientific from our vocabulary they are just hollow phrases which do only emotive work for us
5767948 the occasional pressure to suppress dissent in the name of the orthodoxy of the day is even more injurious to science than all the forms of pseudoscience put together
5767949 it has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time and faces many unsolved problems but the community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in relation to others and is selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations

5767965 youve got to concentrate on your lane and i didnt know what happened the thing you have to do is youve got to keep running and never quit you never know where you are in the race i kind of thought i was up there but it was by a thousandth of a second its hard to deal with its hard but im healthy and i thank god for that
5767966 my right hamstring grabbed on me and i just couldnt move it anymore i tried to hold them off and i just couldnt im so disappointed because ive never had anything like that happen i was totally out of control on the straightaway i was all over the lane christine ohuruogu was just really strong coming home
5767967 i felt really good i thought i ran the first 200 really under control i felt really strong i started working the curve and i came off in good position i got to about 320 and i knew i had at least 70 meters to go and my right hamstring kind of grabbed i tried to pull it through but it just got really low on me and from there on my legs just got really heavy
5767968 i knew that gold was mine i knew i was going to run 48 seconds i felt so good i was already getting elated coming off the turn because i knew how my races had been going my hamstring just really let me down i just feel like ive worked so hard in vain
5767969 it was good i just wanted to get through comfortably being out there im kind of blind so i dont really know how fast i need to be going i just really wanted to run a decent turn
5767970 the great thing about the 100m is the front end is where i need my work so i got a lot of work in and now i can let my endurance take over
5767971 i felt great i ran the turn hard got in the straight away and felt where i was and based my pace off of that you kind of feed off of who is around you you dont want to give that much because you still have more rounds to go its good to feel where you are compared to everyone else
5767972 it was pretty good i just wanted to hold my form i didnt want to go into the normal muna lee swing it felt much better than any other time
5767973 i was pretty mad but it was kind of like fuel to my fire ill just think about that when it comes to the final its a rivalry but it is a friendly one because we all trained together in college we kind of grew up around each other
5767974 the pace was hard everything was saying you dont want to go this fast you dont want to go this fast but when youre in the race you cant get into those mind games so i just gave it everything i had ive got to figure out how to run a little bit of a smoother race
5767975 how about that i really like that a lot it has a good ring to it it just shows how hard we are working weve got good coaches a good support system
5767976 i always want to make sure im in that top six i just fought it a little bit harder just to make sure i was in there you never know what can happen
5767977 i was just saying thats amazing three runners in the final its going to make the final a little bit less nerve wracking to see friends everywhere on the track im just so proud of us i think we are making a statement and im so happy to be a part of it
5767978 that was the tiger no one is going to pull away from me until i know i am safely in and then i might conserve a tad with two laps to go i was like unless i start walking i knew what the time was on that last lap i didnt dig all the way but this time it was planned save that for friday
5767979 it felt really smooth it was the kind of race i expected its a little warmer today so i thought it would be tactical i felt great my foot was actually grabbing a little tight with 350 to go i actually felt i was going to finish stronger from there i was just trying to stay strong and get the last automatic spot
5767980 its been a little tight on and off since ive been here i felt really smooth until about 350 to go in that race where i felt like my form change a little bit i just need to get it treated and rest up for friday
5767981 im more comfortable when its tactical running close to the front than sitting way in the back so i was just trying to stay out of trouble it was pretty physical i knew that sometime in the last 1000m someone was going to take off and i was trying to be ready for that
5767982 its just one race at a time i ran 20 good hurdles i have 20 more left to go to get to my ultimate goal i just went out there today to make it to the next round and work on a few things thats exactly what i did so im happy that i made it to the next round
5767983 its always disappointing when you lose two of the greatest competitors that have ever run the event but at the same time i have to go out there and take care of my lane just like i was going to regardless
5767984 it was a good race for me i think that it was right where i need to be and will set me up well for my final the weather is great here and im using that to my advantage hopefully i feel great tomorrow
5767985 let me say first that its unfortunate hes a great athlete and i hope that he has a speedy recovery with him being one of the great hurdlers theres an opportunity for anyone to step up for a medal
5767986 i thought that was a good preview for the final what do you think shawn and bolt are looking good and im trying to run myself into shape after injury im getting faster every round
5767987 coach ford and michael johnson both wanted me to work on the first 200m like i did yesterday i worked the turn a lot better today i was able to shut it down with 50m to go it was a real good time with the way i ran im excited about thursday
5767988 i knew where i was at in my training and i knew what i could do i was just out there to qualify run a good time and work on some things for the final i did everything that i wanted to and im real impressed with the way i ran today
5767989 i watched the race its olympic time its time to run smart and leave it all on the track i cant control what the next person does im just going to go out thursday and run the heck out of my race
5767990 i set it up well so i didnt have to run as hard coming home thats what it is all about a lot of countries havent been through three rounds like we did at nationals the u s team has an advantage in these rounds i know how to run a preliminary i know how to get through a semifinal and the final is all about leaving it on the track
5767991 i jus thank god thats the only reason i made it im extremely happy overwhelmed
5767992 its feeling pretty good im getting great treatment everything is working out good im not feeling anything when i run im pretty confident my fitness is there its really just about executing my race the last 100 meters showed me that if i do what i need to do ill be okay

5767998 there are a few countries that will say told you so
5767999 but many more will want to walk away from the problem and for the next few years georgia will be far too busy trying to pick itself up

5768004 christmas of 1971 was centered around scripture that john had gotten from the first bible we had been able to get from the vietnamese

5768010 well go ahead with the renovation of gentilly 2 because its a plant that has been used safely for 25 years
5768011 the site of the plant is very safe as much for production as for storing nuclear waste
5768012 the government has had a policy that wont accept a used fuel waste site in quebec
5768013 today however they have given the ok to producing more radioactive waste thats hypocritical
5768014 i dont think everyone will have the expectation that it will achieve those kind of levels because the market is very different now

5768067 todays supreme court decision is yet another stinging rebuke of the bush administrations extreme views on executive power time after time the supreme court has rebuffed the administrations attempts to undermine the constitution from its rasul and hamdi decisions in 2004 to its hamdan decision in 2006 it is a testament to our system of government that the court has rejected the habeas stripping provisions of the military commissions act and reaffirmed that the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily without judicial review the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created we can and must fight terrorists without abandoning the principles on which our country was founded

5768080 it really felt like flagship was on that verge of turning a corner
5768081 we knew before we launched there was enough feedback from people where we realized yeah we probably made a mistake but at that point the train had left the station
5768082 its basically held by the bank if flagship could come up with the money to pay back the loan its ours again but we dont have that money you spend four years working on a game and then to not even be able to do anything with pretty rough

5768120 we dodged a bullet with the storm so that s leading to some selling

5768130 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5768131 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5768132 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5768133 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5768134 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5768135 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

5768183 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation

5768186 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
5768187 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
5768188 this is almost like a soap opera theres so much negative press and blogging this these firmware update issues are another problem apple doesnt need at amp t as a seller of this doesnt need from a pr standpoint
5768189 the question is will it impact sales despite the allure of the 199 price
5768190 people will have to take it on faith that this will eventually get fixed because apple needs to fix it

5768193 the bengals tried for an extended period of time to support chris and his potentially bright career we had hoped to guide him toward an appropriate standard of personal responsibility that this community would support and that would allow him to play in the nfl but those efforts end today as we move on with what is best for our team

5768198 flames were coming up the outside to the top of the bus
5768199 weve got to continue replacing these buses we tend to say we are going to do things and then find ways not to do them
5768200 the bus that burned monday last had its turbo replaced in december 2003 the bus was last inspected by mechanics july 24
5768201 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5768202 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5768203 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5768204 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5768205 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5768206 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5768207 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5768208 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the cease fire and should be removed immediately
5768209 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5768210 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship
5768211 thank you russia for standing up to the crackpots in control of our government
5768212 the abkhaz ossetian and adjarian people will never agree to live under georgian arrogant oppression
5768213 this is natos prime moment to show that it as an organization is not yet obsolete
5768214 i literally laughed out loud when president bush made his speech toward russia about how bullying is unacceptable in foreign policy in the 21st century
5768215 there is no reason that we should be antagonizing them on their border it scares me that this oilman president will take us into another war with a much more deadly foe over an oil pipeline through georgia i am a registered republican but enough is enough impeach george bush if he gets us involved in the russo georgian war
5768216 i feel like i am living in the bizarro world do you people not realize that georgia started the conflict do you people not realize that georgia attacked civilians and peacekeeping troops in an international zone do you not realize that the news media has been caught showing footage of the destroyed cities in ossetia destroyed by georgians and claims it is gori and russian aftermath do you not realize that the caucasus region is an oil pipeline area do you not realize that the us armed and trained the georgians
5768217 georgias president is the new hitler he is invading areas and his lies are so incredibly manipulative the american media is really showing stupidity here in hopes for new cold war ratings neo cons and globalists are thrilled because now russia has taken its eye off of the iran situation
5768218 if we all respect the territorial integrity of serbia in regards to its kosovo province then we are also going to honor the territorial integrity of georgia but if someone doesnt respect serbias territorial integrity and sovereignty over kosovo and metohija then they better shut up about the territorial integrity of georgia

5768294 on opening the bottle i found the cherry and other fruit to be a little tart along with cocoa vanilla and leather good body and well balanced the next afternoon opened up a whole new world the nose exploded with cinnamon leather plum blackberry and later settled into slight notes of violets and coffee it was like unpeeling an onion minus the tears as the layers revealed themselves gracefully my tongue took turns with different dance partners first black cherry then fig then pepper a stack of smoke and finally cinnamon toast we all thought it was super smooth to be a fairly young wine

5768337 past events are what they are in a mind independent way
5768338 cordons off narrative organization and all relational properties of past events from the past itself
5768339 while it is true that which relational properties we attend to and thus how we narratively organize the past may be interest relative whether a past event has a given relational property is not interest relative in other words it is true that whether we describe a past event in light of this later event or that later event is up to us historians tell different stories about past events according to which later events they find to be most significantly tied to the earlier events this does not mean that whether a given narrative sentence is true is something subjective the fact that we are the ones who describe the earlier shooting in light of the later death by calling it a killing does not make the killing subjective or relative to the knower once we see this it should be clear that the properties of past events that emerge only as a result of later events are ontological not epistemic realism about past events is not incompatible with recognition that the past is not fixed in virtue of its delayed relational properties
5768340 social phenomena in general exemplify how relational changes and relational properties are constitutive of the core properties of a thing or event since social phenomena fundamentally depend for their very existence on peoples beliefs about and behavior toward those phenomena
5768341 historically what they are only in virtue of their being part of narrative wholes that encompass other events

5768364 one doesnt feel today as if there is an international official unaffiliated with his countrys national agenda who can be relied upon to be sent into a crisis suss the scene and while not a miracle worker max out on what can be achieved through negotiations through the mobilization of international resources sergio was a hell of a salesman once he got back to capitols etc
5768365 up until the early 1990s the u n was mostly a diplomatic forum

5768372 council unity proves to be a crucial ingredient to the international community actually getting what it wants and that unity has never been more lacking the go to guy was gone
5768373 there was obvious warmth friendliness and charm between sergio this paris educated charming elegant guy and this guy gusmao who had been living in jungles for years and imprisoned for years the bond between them was so clear just from the body language that vieira de mello had earned his trust it just showed you the enormous importance of the human element in diplomacy
5768374 to the degree i can be certain of anything he was going to stick to that
5768375 he focused on broadening the iraqi political process as much as possible
5768376 he went to all the capitols of all the surrounding countries and spoke at the highest level he could reach and in iraq he did much the same
5768377 in 2007 that stopped we said you guys are in charge you know take me to your leaders we treated the landscape as we found it
5768378 he was trying to extend the political process in iraq and out of iraq with the idea that that would lead to the earliest possible end of the occupation because the occupation would become less necessary

5768430 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5768431 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5768432 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5768433 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5768434 this is amazing i cant believe it i dont what to say
5768435 oh my god youve got to be kidding me is this for real
5768436 i was more pumped than i have ever been in my life i dont even know how i got out
5768437 i saw lolo jones go down and i thought go for it and i did
5768438 anything less than the final and she would have been gutted absolutely devastated
5768439 there was no pressure once she was in the final
5768440 those first two rounds were the tough part of the deal
5768441 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5768442 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5768443 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5768444 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5768445 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5768446 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5768447 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5768448 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5768449 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5768450 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5768451 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5768452 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5768453 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5768454 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5768455 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5768456 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5768457 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5768458 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5768459 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5768460 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5768461 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5768462 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5768463 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5768464 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5768465 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5768466 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5768467 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5768468 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5768469 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5768470 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5768471 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5768472 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5768473 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5768474 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5768475 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5768476 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5768477 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5768478 this request for additional information from the doj is a normal and expected part of the regulatory process
5768479 inbev remains confident that the transaction will receive regulatory approval and continues to expect to close the transaction by the end of this year
5768480 have been primarily driven by rising fuel costs and our inability to pass these increases on to our customers due to a highly competitive market
5768481 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5768482 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5768483 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5768484 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5768485 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5768486 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5768487 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5768488 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5768489 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5768490 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5768491 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5768492 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5768493 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5768494 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5768495 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5768496 who are open to doing something on the production side
5768497 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5768498 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5768499 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5768500 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5768501 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5768502 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5768503 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5768504 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5768505 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5768509 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5768510 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5768511 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5768512 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5768513 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5768514 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5768515 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5768516 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5768517 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5768518 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5768519 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5768520 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5768521 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5768522 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5768523 doctors may not discriminate against gays and lesbians in medical treatment even if the procedures being sought conflict with physicians religious beliefs
5768524 the 1st amendments right to the free exercise of religion does not exempt defendant physicians here from conforming their conduct to the antidiscrimination requirements
5768525 this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women
5768526 its a win for everyone because anyone could be the next target if doctors are allowed to pick and choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people
5768527 we think one of the things new york needs to come back is a strong relationship with the federal government
5768528 is looking at obamas message of change and hope and is very down on the last eight years of what the bush administration has done especially the iraq war
5768529 while we are making a lot of improvements the mobileme service is still not up to our standards we are extending subscriptions 60 days free of charge to express appreciation for our members patience as we continue to improve the service
5768530 a 60 day extension will be applied and your account will not expire until you have reached your new expiration date
5768531 if you recently received an e mail stating your account will expire soon or you saw similar messaging while using mobileme please ignore it
5768532 the launch of mobileme was not our finest hour mobileme was simply not up to apples standards and it clearly needed more time and testing there are several things we could have done better
5768533 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
5768534 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence

5768538 the 2009 schedule reflects realigned dates that are good opportunities for everyone involved in our sport fans sponsors tracks and teams
5768539 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that
5768540 theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves and the fact of the matter is its not 2004 anymore its 2007 and i think you have to live in the present and you cant live by big names you cant live in the past it doesnt matter what somebody did in an olympic gold medal game in the olympics three years ago now is what matters and thats what i think
5768541 i know hope is probably very happy to see brazil
5768542 it has nothing to do with those shots that got by scurry
5768543 that was 11 months ago i dont think its a personal thing anymore i think its our team wanting to reclaim what we could have gotten at the world cup it has nothing to do with anything personal right now
5768544 i think it would be nice to play brazil because you always want to reclaim what you could have had
5768545 i got five different stories about what happened i said to each player ok two questions one do you want to win
5768546 ok thats why they are here the fact is we want to move on were in this together

5768563 the rise of the indo afghan empire c 1710 1780
5768564 the pathans themselves left no early contemporary literature they built no monuments and left no inscriptions in their own country therefore the historians must rely on stray and chance material available in the records the literature monuments and coins of the many dynasties and peoples whose path took them to the territories where the afghans now dwell
5768565 the record of these traditions and tribal tables is suggestive
5768566 under this interpretation even the bani israel story may reflect some part of the truth and at least indicate a cause for a belief which however unreasonable it is hard to shake
5768567 it is inconceivable that a conquering race such as the epthalites huns which left proved descendants down in india among the rajputs did not contribute also to the blood of the peoples of gandahara peshawar which was one of their headquarters
5768568 the family tree of ghurghusht qais third son is shorter and less attractive the kakars of zhob loralai and parts of sibi in baluchistan are a very large tribe and they have never been held high in the account whether in war or peace and are less anarchic
5768569 about two thirds of the original utmanzai territory is now occupied by the gaduns who in old days were invited to cross the indus as mercenaries and were given in requital the lands they now hold on the western and southern slopes of mahaban mountain the trans frontier clans contain about 2000 fighting men they do not enlist freely nor are they in request being considered to be of smaller fighting value than other pthans the trans indus gaduns are bounded by the utmanzais by amazais the tribesmen are all cultivators or cattle owners
5768570 the first genuine and historical glimpse of the afghan and pathan peoples in their own country is given to us in the inimitable baburnama the memoirs of babur the first mughal emperor 1482 1530 prior to this the names ghaljis and lodhis was all that was heard in the chronicles
5768571 when we come to babur everything changes suddenly the curtain rises the footlights go up on the afghan scene that up to that moment has been shrouded in darkness
5768572 from the narrative it is likely that the change of plan was due to negotiations between babur and malik shah mansur usafzai negotiations which ended in baburs taking the maliks daughter in marriage
5768573 in other words baburs evidence taken on broad view does not conflict with the suggestion for afghan and pathan origins as set out earlier in this book
5768574 where they had emigrated from the west of indus in the 17th century
5768575 the protection granted to such parasites was not free however and had to be earned
5768576 the hamsayas received territories of their own land and could act as their buffers against outside encroachments
5768577 even the laws of hospitality will go down before the nurtured enmity bequeathed by blood feud
5768578 i believe that tribal movements have been very greatly exaggerated in the tribal traditions in my time i have seen a process of replacement of one tribe by another going peacefully on over a period of generation in the usafzai and mohammadzai territory known as maira in the north of samah
5768579 for some years however the gaduns continued to give trouble committing outrages of all kinds and raiding on the border they were blockaded coerced and fined they were implicated in attacks on malakand and chakdara posts but in the end they finally made submission and paid up the fines demanded of them
5768580 the pathan tribes who boasted they had never within memory yielded even to mughal or durrani had actually suffered defeat in open battle at the hands of unbelievers
5768581 that peshawar contains no architectural monuments of any value is due mainly to the devastation of 1823
5768582 the hatred of the sikh terror which they shared no doubt helped them to sink all jealousies and work together for the common end
5768583 as a people they have always been evilly notorious for their faithlessness lawlessness treachery and brutality so much so that the saying afghan be iman afghan is faithless has passed into a proverb among neighboring peoples and oddly enough is acknowledged by themselves to be a true count not only in their dealings with the stranger but among themselves too
5768584 i was 20 years old in 1847 and i met him more than once and i remember him well i was once in a jirga when he asked us if we would stand and fight with sikhs if he stood by us we swore we would there were tears in our eyes and a tear in abbott sahibs eye too we did he was our father there are no angrez like abbott sahib now we loved him
5768585 among the people of hazara he left a name which will not die
5768586 it is impossible to reflect on the tribal society without mention of nawab abdul qayyum khan
5768587 to look at he was magnificent who held his head splendidly
5768588 among the people of n w f p he will live for ever
5768589 year by year the pathans of n w f p became more conscious of a challenge an uplifting that called them to an expansion of the mind faintly dreamed of but never before realized the eyes of youth turned to wider horizon of ambition and employment he was outgrowing the trammels of tribalism and began to look with contempt on the introversions of kabul under durrani feudal
5768590 afghanistan is largely an ethnic mystery in the absence of written records makes tracing their ethnogenesis almost impossible in recent years scholars have begun to examen the afghan ethnic groups but anthropometric and serological evidence is still scanty and historic sources are fragmentary and inconclusive thus the question of afghans origin has evoked more controversy than consensus
5768591 no part of afghanistan has been subject to more speculative theories or requires more practical elucidation than this mountain region in which so large a share of the drama of afghanistan history has been played
5768592 the mythical character of the whole account is surely clear enough from what has been said even the story of the early conversion of qais and his companions can be disproved we shall see from reliable muslim sources including the traveler al biruni and the courtier al utbi both writing in the time of mahmud of ghazni early in the eleventh century a d these accounts establish that four centuries later than the time of qais the province of kabul had not been islamized and this was only achieved under the ghaznavids the hindu shahiya kingdom of jaipal extended almost to kabul and mahmud had to fight against infidel afghans of the sulaiman mountains even later than this in the great war of a d 1192 between the muslim invaders and the hindu kingdom of northern india the hindu ruler had assembled a force of afghan horsemen and there were afghans fighting on both sides there is thus more than an indication that even at the end of the twelfth century the sixth hijri all afghans had not been converted though the legends represent them as rushing into the fold in the days of khalid
5768593 the theory of jewish origin of pathans though ardently believed in by many pathan intellectuals does not stand a test of a scientific analysis the gap of 1700 years between qais and his ancestor king saul is supposed to have been filled in by 36 generations which does not appeal to reason the whole account of this theory is thus reduced to a legend pure and simple
5768594 israel appears to have blue eyes and among its characteristics red hair but there is no sort of proof of the claim nor its likely that one can ever be forthcoming also the name afghanistan was born in relatively modern times formerly it was known as kabulistan and khorasan
5768595 because they were a tribe of prestige and vigor and because they held some of the best part of what we now call afghanistan and because it was one of their chiefs who founded the afghan power calling it the durrani empire all the muslim tribes other than the turkish origin claim to be offshoots of the same race the story of the afghan tribes those who call themselves the ben i israel has been told and how many have tacked themselves on to a bogus genealogy because it was fashionable thing to do cis indus is the tract once famous as the black mountain and the scene of many expeditions to prevent its tribes raiding into the peaceful districts of hazara here the bulk of the clans all belong to the big subgroup of the izazai but with them three are non pathan origin known as gaduns the swatis of allai and the tanawals
5768596 as has already been said there are certain tribes which by location and association are commonly styled pathans but are not so in reality
5768597 it is curious to find that swatis in hazara district describing themselves as pakhtuns and gaduns do the same though the only theory that they are perhaps connected with the kakar pathans is in my opinion rubbish they are not pathans at all in origin
5768598 the origin of the tribe gaduns or jaduns is not very clear but they certainly have no connection with the yusafzais among whom they dwell they claim descent from the family of ghurghusht but are more probably of rajput origin many of the descendants of jadu the founder of rajput dynasty emigrated from gujrat some eleven hundred years before christ to the hills of kabul and kandahar when they moved to mahaban range the tribe crossed the indus into hazara these have however lost all connection with their trans frontier tribesmen and are to all intents and purposes punjabis
5768599 the trans frontier clans contain about 2000 fighting men they do not enlist freely nor are they in request being considered to be of smaller fighting value than other pthans the trans indus gaduns are bounded by the utmanzais by amazais the tribesmen are all cultivators or cattle owners
5768600 about two thirds of the original utmanzai territory is now occupied by the gaduns who in old days were invited to cross the indus as mercenaries and were given in requital the lands they now hold on the western and southern slopes of mahaban mountain
5768601 this tribe is especially illustrious as the representative of buddha the founder of buddhist religion whose direct descendants are always regarded as yadus the original name has become strangely corrupted and the race is now seldom designated as yadu or yaduvana but commonly by the term jadu or jadun or jadubansi
5768602 the utman division of mandanr occupies the southern slopes of mahaban mountains on the west bank of the indus jointly with the gadun or jadun tribe these gadun represent the great yadu tribe their name became the patronymic of the descendants of buddha a progenitor of lunar race
5768603 those who try to identify the pathans exclusively with the jews or the aryans or the greeks or the white huns are not rationalists they base their opinions mostly on traditions and legends which cannot stand a scientific analysis the habitat of pathans is located such that all the foreign invaders of india pass through it leaving behind stragglers and deserters who settled permanently and thus mingled their blood with that of those among whom they lived the fact is that the pathans are the finished product of racial intermingling extending over three thousand years they have thus become a hybrid race and the distinction between afghan and pathanas made by caroe neither appeals to common sense nor conforms to the beliefs held by all the pashto speaking people
5768604 gaduns about 10 000 on the banks of indus although some speak pashto they can no longer be considered as pashtoon tribe

5768773 karl rove has already declared congressman steve kagen their 1 candidate to beat in 2008
5768774 that means unlimited special interest money to pay for their negative campaign
5768775 word from the beat is that karl rove has decided that steve kagen is his number one seat in the entire country to win in 2008

5768969 con mucha determinaci n y coraje ha hecho vibrar a los paname os con emoci n
5768970 a lo mejor el presidente hace algo para celebrar esta medalla
5768971 para los j venes irving es una figura muy importante
5768972 hey mr dj play that beat down by law switch the licks mastermix contest
5768973 so what manage it get over it dont look backwards look forwards
5768974 winston for gods sake snap out of it look at this as a blessing in disguise
5768975 weve got airlines dropping their mileage theoretically 14 to 15
5768976 weve got consumer confidence at an all time low business confidence is also low construction prices have gone up the fed is worrying that its got enough money to fund every bank thats going down credit is unavailable and the dollar is weak
5768977 yes there is more stuff coming around the corner but much of it is replacing stuff that is or will be obsolete obsolete not because its necessarily that old but because the product doesnt work for the market
5768978 the s amp ls were a problem credit was an issue borrowers couldnt get any money blood was on the streets you had a lot
5768979 double digit growth in revpar revenue per available room afterwards and a period of incredible boom until we had dot com mania too much hype secondary investments wall street lending everything to everybody and then we had 9 11
5768980 the theory is that if you achieve less than 3 revpar growth your margins go south
5768981 i dont believe it i believe the systems are in place should managers choose to use them to manage labor to manage energy better you can manage margins and i believe the chains get it and i believe theyre going to do it
5768982 the panel was very upbeat everybody was feeling quite good about industry conditions
5768983 so far there has been no real uptick in credit problems many of the developers provide their own financing to their timeshare buyers and so theyre not immediately affected when banks cut back on their lending
5768984 from the 1970s on timeshares have shown a unique capacity to keep growing were recession resilient not recession proof
5768985 only a small fraction of american homeowners at this point own timeshares so the sky is the limit this remains a very vibrant industry
5768986 the ability of an undercapitalized developer to do a project today is virtually nil
5768987 the business now is very capital intensive you need deep pockets to compete
5768988 a couple can go to the beach with the entire family for a week or just the two of them can visit an urban timeshare in a city like san francisco for a weekend
5768989 we try to have something for everyone and we have pricing to match all needs that kind of flexibility is what helps keep us growing
5768990 but in the end every developer makes an independent decision whether their product will or wont be successful
5768991 some owners expect too much from a brand youve got to constantly market your property but its a great way to start your day knowing that the brand has already filled up 50 percent of your hotel
5768992 some things they do are difficult to swallow and theyre not always accountable some brands will sell you something and then not follow through
5768993 its not as much of a problem to add standards when business is on the upswing but it can be difficult when were on a down slope as the industry is now
5768994 we need more transparency in the data and how the brands use it
5768995 there has been a definite slowdown in the planning stages of the development cycle
5768996 and we dont know how long it will last im hoping its only 12 to 18 months
5768997 mixed use development is one solution to financing as pre sales of a residential component can be used to finance the hotel portion of the project obviously mixed use doesnt make sense in every situation however
5768998 the u s is on sale right now but were competing with many other countries that promote themselves much better than we do
5768999 as an industry and a nation we need to project a better image
5769000 not everyones like you who knows exactly what you want to do i still dont know and im almost 35
5769001 den menschen sagen mit uns kommt ihr in den himmel und k nnt die h lle vermeiden

5769003 at the 320 mark my right hamstring grabbed me and i just couldnt move it anymore
5769004 ive never had anything like that happen i was totally out of control on the straightaway i was all over the lane and christine ohuruogu was just really strong coming home
5769005 i dont want to tell you what im thinking right now because its not positive
5769006 i feel so betrayed by my body once again and its such a tough break for me
5769007 i crossed the line and it was very hard for me to pick myself back up

5769012 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5769013 the bloody turf battles that have been waged for the better part of this year in the northern state of chihuahua and in the border city of ciudad juarez in particular continued this past week the usual cadence of violence in the state was punctuated by two particularly brutal incidents
5769014 ran into michel richard while dining at citronelle a few nights ago and he said he was going to be at social on tuesday for anyone that can make it there its a great chance to meet with the santa of cooking

5769016 treason against the state combined with treason against allah as shown by overt crimes
5769017 four alternative punishments are mentioned any one of which is to be applied according to circumstances viz execution crucifixion maiming or exile
5769018 we are guiltless of you and whatever you worship besides allah we have rejected you and there has arisen between us and you enmity and hatred forever unless you believe in allah and him alone
5769019 la iqra fi al deen let there be no compulsion in religion
5769020 lakum deen e kum wal ya deen your religion for you and my religion for me
5769021 it may require fighting in allahs cause as a form of self sacrifice but its jihads essence consists in a true and sincere faith which so fixes its gaze on allah that all selfish or worldly motives seem paltry and fade away mere brutal fighting is opposed to the whole spirit of jihad while the sincere scholars pen or preachers voice or wealthy mans contributions may be the most valuable forms of jihad
5769022 are the indian mussalmans bound by their religion to rebel against the queen
5769023 canadas 2 500 soldiers are responsible for security in kandahar province
5769024 the view from our room of lake louise was amazing it is hard to believe the color of the lake a light turquoise today it is really cold outside and as we looked up at the mountains it looked like it was snowing not long after as we were walking around and taking heaps of photos a few flecks of snow start falling on us we head off along the old highway towards banff at around midday we are limited on this road due to the native wildlife in the area with the speed limit set to 50klm hr this makes the 130klm drive to banff longer than expected we stop along the way at johnstone canyon to stretch our legs on the 1 5km walk to the falls here
5769025 i need to test this view with some real data to make sure it looks ok we have all these factory methods to use in our unit tests can we use those in development
5769026 pure a 90 day devotional for the mind the body amp the spirit
5769027 how do you take care of your mind body and spirit
5769028 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5769029 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5769030 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5769031 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5769032 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5769033 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5769034 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed

5769043 what is america a short history of the new world order
5769044 barry goldwater the republican partys 1964 presidential candidate once said
5769045 if such policy continues the united states will become like a third world dictatorship where the military is the only effective institution or not even that if the nations right of force is sold off to contractors and mercenaries
5769046 while its spell lasts a few will get obscenely rich others will thrive as middle men and the rest will either scrape by or starve we can aleady see this happening
5769047 what kind of progress is this did america throw off the divine right of kings only to enthrone worldwide the divine right of things
5769048 in short a cabal of weapons dealers and oil profiteers who came to power in the worlds mightiest nation by dubious means took advantage of the sept 11th attacks to start an unrelated war they
5769049 but since the mid term elections of 2006 there have been encouraging signs that american democracy is capable of repairing itself however he concludes hoping for the best instead of learning from the past has often led america astray
5769050 if this judgment seems harsh consider these departures from the modern norm
5769051 the united states is the only major western nation where the dearth penalty is still used where one person in 130 is in jail the worlds highest rate of incarceration where pistols and assault rifles are readily on sale where five people in 10 think the creation myth in the bible is literally true where only one citizen in 8 has a passport where there is no universal health care with the widest gap between wealthy and poor and the lowest direct taxation
5769052 american prestige has never been lower yet whether we like it or not the united states is such a military and economic power that what it does is everyones business
5769053 we may still hope for progressive american leadership in the world but we can no longer afford the old 20th century habit of depending on it repeatedly seduced by atavistic impulses american has become an unreliable member of the world community
5769054 began the accumulation of loot labour and land that would build the columbian age at first in europe and then in north america
5769055 populous hierarchical ruled by haughty lords who lived on pyramids
5769056 the columbian age was built on colonial attitudes on taming the wilderness civilizing the savage and the american dream of endless plenty
5769057 now there is nothing left to colonize half a millennium of expansion has run out of room
5769058 few will have likely heard so charming an analysis of american depredations an entertaining highly tendentious account of where we ve been and where we re headed
5769059 see you can cup the scrotum as a sort of handle and the shaft is the perfect shape to fit in your mouth
5769060 we must not only prepare our children for the world we must also prepare the world for our children

5769065 the welfare of our staff member is our main concern
5769066 we felt the content of the program was not suitable for the age group
5769067 we had some lines that perhaps were a bit too direct
5769068 theres no raunchiness in the play itself just a few lines are a little testy
5769069 while people might aspire to living in the bush or on the coast actually the quality of life is much better in the suburbs of our major cities
5769070 why are they drafting a quarterback as high as the third round when there are other needs
5769071 hey scott great question i also have concerns about the patriots offensive line heading into the 2008 season however as we all know tom brady is easily the best quarterback in the nfl and the patriots have the best offensive line coach in the nfl in dante scarnecchia which takes a tremendous amount of pressure off the patriots offensive line under bill belichick the patriots have always done a great job of utilizing moving parts on the offensive line meaning versatility is a major key in a players development i think it is much more difficult to play offensive tackle in the nfl than offensive guard because the skills sets are different and to me you have to be much more athletic out on the edges at tackle than inside at guard due to the match ups so even though the scouting specifics are somewhat similar in what youre grading strength run block pass block positional traits the coaching specifics the type of player that best fits the system are different as it pertains to the position in the end the patriots offensive line will improve once they get their franchise quarterback back on the field
5769072 part of it is that the bigger a player gets the taller or longer sometimes a player is the less fluid they are in changing direction when youre looking for a corner they have to be reactive athletes to see changes know whats going on plant their foot and drive toward the football the longer taller bodies have more difficulty being reactive type athletes
5769073 well defer just about every time unless there is some overriding circumstance that would cause us to do it differently it will take some type of extreme conditions or a very unusual situation to not do that if you win the toss
5769074 we can cut 192 jobs just like that so work with us at the negotiating table
5769075 there have been multiple cases of overheating and fire damage in particular during recharging so please use caution
5769076 he felt like he had a layer of security but he probably never counted on a turtle with a tracking device leading us to that location and finding the field

5769108 its very important to get your child to bed at a decent time
5769109 i see children so sleepy when they come in that they cant think properly theyre so tired i dont think parents understand how important it is for their children to get good sleep
5769110 refined carbohydrates like sugar spike the blood sugar at first
5769111 then it bottoms out pretty quickly thats when they will appear tired and lethargic and cant learn as well
5769112 what would you like to start with fast or slow

5769115 the parents said its like the music woke her up it really elevated her
5769116 it was about a little girl with no hair going to get some hair at the wig shop and then she went to the park and felt the sun on her face
5769117 for a moment shes a little girl with hair swinging on the swings at the park and having fun
5769118 shes inside there she needs a memory or a thought to help her connect with whats going on around her

5769126 most humans will feel very overwhelmed at some point in their lives and may have thoughts like i wish i was dead one out of every two students reports depression that makes it hard for them to get out of bed and get to class
5769127 people who are stressed and overwhelmed are something that we see here every day but someone who is seriously considering hurting themselves or ending their lives is something that is more likely tied to a mental health condition some people are incapable of handling whatever stress they feel at that time that is where the outreach and training piece comes in
5769128 we really want to get these students connected to the proper counseling
5769129 we do this training so we can recognize the signs that someone may be suicidal because we want to get them to communicate and to receive the proper counseling

5769138 our ministry told apple to improve its technological development and probe the cause of the incidents so that similar incidents do not happen again
5769139 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5769140 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5769141 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5769142 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5769143 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5769144 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5769145 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5769146 we have athletes who are doing this for three years i am used to athletes being in modern pentathlon for 10 years
5769147 i have been on the edge to the point that this was not a mentally healthy endeavor
5769148 my family for the first year asked me to not do this the financial stress because i had to sell my house to do it the mental stress i was losing falling off the horse its tough to take after you win a gold medal in one sport and you win a world championship in another sport you find yourself getting humiliated time and time again youre broke financially nobody really believes you can do it
5769149 theres something that drives her that doesnt drive other people
5769150 the biggest problem i had was getting her to relax the horse knows
5769151 i ate at taco bell i gained weight i was just driving and eating junk food all the time after two years of doing that i entered a local triathlon in michigan just to lose weight
5769152 it took me 21 years to figure out how to make the olympic swim team it took me one year and two months to make the olympic triathlon team part of what ive learned is youve got an engine but everybody takes their own path
5769153 the next day he left a message saying i would win a gold medal in 2004 and in 2005 i would retire and have his baby
5769154 ive never had a phone call like that i didnt know if it was a joke it just grew from there fedex packages of roses plans for our marriage moving to france

5769832 again again producer redone is verantwoordelijk voor het gehele album van de aankomende popsensatie hiermee laat ook hij gelijk zijn veelzeidigheid aan de wereld zien houd de site in de gaten voor deze producer in september hebben we namelijk een exclusief interview met deze top producer
5769833 i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
5769834 by all indications mr obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
5769835 mr obama and his running mate will begin perhaps that day a visit to swing states plans call for them to be on the trail together for much of the time between the day of the announcement and the day mr obama arrives in denver a week from wednesday but their most intense campaigning together will come after the convention
5769836 there are signs that obama may wait to announce his choice until this weekend or just before in hopes of providing a big boost before the convention opens monday in denver
5769837 in addition to giving some convention eve energy to obamas campaign a late in the week rollout would have another benefit in the eyes of his loyalists it could help overshadow the other dominant story heading into denver which is the long running drama over how sen hillary rodham clinton and her husband former president bill clinton and clintons supporters will handle themselves during the week
5769838 theres an outside chance the nod could come as soon as wednesday but sources indicated monday that the planning was still fluid and later was more likely
5769839 our goal is to give a behind the scenes look at what an athlete as a spectator would do at the games anything from a swimmer playing ping pong to a runner at the great wall
5769840 ive been using macs and final cut pro for the past 3 years ive competed in the world cup for eight seasons since 1999 and ive already visited china several times usually at events up in northern china
5769841 my working with final cut pro all started as a side hobby when i shot a bunch of travel diaries for my ski team on the road i like having complete control over my editing now ive bought all of the apple pro training books which i read in my spare time away from regular training i feel pretty strong in final cut pro and im starting to work with motion and soundtrack pro
5769842 final cut server is definitely a key piece of software for us
5769843 once ive done my editing i just drag the file into my folder and its automatically converted and uploaded back to ottawa it allows blomeley to do everything remotely and avoid having to send out a whole production crew we also dont have to send every clip i shoot over the internet because final cut server only uploads the footage that i actually use in the edit
5769844 its a 12 hour time difference between ottawa and beijing so each day steve has to finish his work by 6 p m so we can start ours at 6 a m
5769845 hes understandably nervous about delivering stories on a daily basis were production people and hes a ski jumper but steve really knows the software so theres no learning curve to work around
5769846 a lot of the incoming greetings from winter athletes were recorded all over canada on a variety of cell phone cameras in formats like avi and 3gp
5769847 the different cell phone codecs are all importing fine into final cut pro once were done with our edits final cut server does the encodes and adds the appropriate logos we supply quickplay media with an h 264 version at 750 mb s and they encode the 3gp versions for cell phones we also use the flip4mac wmv components for quicktime to create wmv files then we upload everything to an ftp site for streaming to the web on the realchampions ca site and directly to cell phone video subscribers
5769848 while steves out shooting during the day were controlling final cut server via apple remote desktop and handling all the playouts at the coh
5769849 at any time steve can take back control and modify the content to insert specific pieces based on whos in the audience watching the mac pro connects directly to the plasma screen via dvi and weve also got a second nvidia card in there as our backup video output
5769850 chris can even take over my macbook pro directly and finish my edits if we run out of time
5769851 as long as the network connection is fast enough we shouldnt have any problems i feel prepared and nervous about this project but im also excited its cool as an athlete to see the games from the other side as an observer i know if i were being interviewed by a fellow athlete id probably react differently to someone who really understands the pressure and demands shooting and editing these stories is going to give me a whole new perspective
5769852 we are extremely grateful to hhmi for this generous contribution
5769853 the speed at which hhmi responded to our request for help speaks volumes to the institutes commitment to sustaining and fostering biomedical research across the nation

5769901 it is invaluable to have an independent monitor who can swiftly question any adverse drug reactions or differences in illness and death rates between groups taking part in the clinical trials
5769902 parents also need to be made aware of the risks of adverse drug reactions when a child takes any medicine so that they can make informed decisions that balance those risks against the possible benefits the drug may provide their child
5769903 there is general agreement by pediatric health professionals regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry as well as politicians and parents that drug trials are essential in order to improve drug therapies
5769904 we are calling for all pediatric drug trials to include independent safety monitoring committees to ensure that this vital work is carried out in a way that minimizes risks and maximizes benefits for the children taking part
5769905 we need to test drugs on children as the only other options are to use unlicensed drugs or prescribe drugs that have been licensed for adults
5769906 but we feel that the small number of studies that reported having safety monitoring committees was unacceptable

5769911 such a state of affairs will have both merits and demerits more important than either however is the fact that nothing less will enable a society imbued with scientific technique to survive scientific technique demands organization and the more it becomes perfected the larger are the organizations that it demands quite apart from war the present depression has made it evident that an international organization of credit and banking is necessary to the prosperity not only of some countries but of all the international organization of industrial production is being rendered necessary by the efficiency of modern methods modern industrial plants can easily supply in many directions much more than the total needs of the world the result of this which should be wealth is in fact poverty owing to competition in the absence of competition the immensely enhanced productivity of labour would enable men to arrive at a just compromise between leisure and goods they could choose whether they would work six hours a day and be rich or four hours a day and enjoy only moderate comfort the advantages of world wide organization both in preventing the waste of economic competition and in removing the danger of war are so great as to be becoming an essential condition for the survival of societies possessing scientific technique this argument is overwhelming in comparison with all counterarguments and renders almost unimportant the question whether life in an organized world state will be more or less satisfactory than life at the present day for it is only in the direction of an organized world state that the human race can develop unless it abandons scientific technique and it will not do this except as the result of a cataclysm so severe as to lower the whole level of civilization the advantages to be derived from an organized world state are great and obvious there will be in the first place security against war and a saving of almost the whole effort and expense now devoted to competitive armaments there will be one must suppose a single highly efficient fighting machine employing mainly aeroplanes and chemical methods of warfare which will be quite obviously irresistible and will therefore not be resisted the central government may be changed from time to time by a palace revolution but this will only alter the personnel of the figure heads not the essential organization of government the central government will of course forbid the propaganda of nationalism by means of which at present anarchy is maintained and will put in its place a propaganda of loyalty to the world state
5769912 we have seen that scientific civilization demands world wide organization if it is to be stable we have considered the possibility of such an organization in matters of government we shall now consider it in the economic sphere at present production is organized as far as possible nationally be means of tariff walls every nation tries to produce at home as much as possible of the goods that it consumes this tendency is on the increase and even great britain which has hitherto aimed at maximizing its exports by means of free trade appears to be on the point of abandoning this policy in favour of comparative economic isolation it is of course clear that from a purely economic point of view it is wasteful to organize production nationally rather than internationally it would be an economy if all the motor cars used throughout the world were manufactured in detroit that is to say a car of given excellence could be produced with less expense of human labour in that case than it can at present in a world scientifically organized most industrial products would be thus localized there would be one place for making pins and needles another place for making scissors and knives another place for making aeroplanes and yet another for agricultural machinery when if ever the world government that we have considered comes into being one of its first tasks will be the international organization of production production will no longer be left as at present to private enterprise but will be undertaken solely in accordance with government orders this is already the case with such things as battleships because in regard to war efficiency is thought to be important but in most matters production is left to the chaotic impulses of private manufacturers who make too much of some things and too little of others with the result that there is poverty in the midst of unused plenty the industrial plant at present existing in the world is in many directions far in excess of the worlds needs by eliminating competition and concentrating production in a single concern all this waste could be avoided the control of raw materials is a matter which in any scientific society would be governed by a central authority at present the important raw materials are controlled by military power the weak nation possessed of oil soon finds itself under suzerainty of some stronger nation the transvaal lost its independence because it contained gold raw material ought not to belong to those who by conquest or diplomacy have happened to acquire the territory in which they are they ought to belong to a world authority which would ration them to those who had the most skill in utilizing them moreover our present economic system causes everybody to be wasteful of raw materials since there is no motive for foresight in a scientific world the supply of any vital raw material will be carefully estimated and as the moment of its exhaustion approaches scientific research will be directed to the discovery of a substitute agriculture for reasons which we considered in an earlier chapter may have less importance in the future than it has at present and has had in the past we shall have not only artificial silk but artificial wool and artificial timber and artificial rubber in time we may have artificial food but in the meantime agriculture will become more and more industrialized both in its methods and in the mentality of those who practise it american and canadian agriculturists have already the industrial mentality not the mentality of the patient peasant machinery will of course be increasingly employed in the neighbourhood of large urban markets intensive cultivation with artificial methods of warming the soil will yield many crops every year here and there throughout the country side there will be large power stations forming the nucleus around which the population will cluster of agricultural mentality as it has been known since ancient times nothing will survive since the soil and even the climate will be subject to human control
5769913 the gain from an economic point of view will be enormous there will be no waste in competitive production no uncertainty as to employment no poverty no sudden alternations of good and bad times every man willing to work will be kept in comfort and every man unwilling to work will be kept in prison when owing to any circumstances the work upon which a man has hitherto been employed is no longer required he will be taught some new kind of work and will be adequately maintained while he is learning his new trade economic motives will be employed to regulate population which will probably be kept stationary almost all that is tragic in human life will be eliminated and even death will seldom come before old age
5769914 it may be assumed that every man and woman will be obliged to work and will be taught a new trade if for any reason work at the old trade is no longer required the pleasantest work of course will be that which gives the most control over the mechanism the posts giving most power will presumably be awarded to the ablest men as a result of intelligence tests for entirely inferior work negroes will be employed wherever possible one may i suppose assume that the most desirable kinds of work will be more highly paid than the less desirable kinds since they require more skill the society will not be one in which there is equality although i doubt whether the inequalities will be hereditary except as between different races i e between white and coloured labour everybody will be comfortable and those who occupy the better paid posts will be able to enjoy considerable luxury there will not be as at present fluctuations of good and bad times for these are merely the result of our anarchic economic system nobody will starve and nobody will suffer the economic anxieties which at present beset rich and poor alike on the other hand life will be destitute of adventure except for the most highly paid experts ever since civilization began men have been seeking security more avidly than they have sough anything else in such a world they will have it but i am not quite sure whether they will think it worth the price that they will have paid for it
5769915 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement
5769916 i dont think anyone is saying that these coupons were hacked unless i missed that part if you printed the coupons from the application at facebook directly those are ok i did 3 days ago just to see what they were but there are people that went and saved those coupons in pdfs and are passing these around
5769917 thank you for your enthusiasm regarding the launch of our facebook application please be aware that someone has hacked into our development database of our coupon offers placed our offers in pdf files and is now distributing them throughout the internet the majority of these coupons were not for distribution they were strictly to be used for sales and marketing demonstrations such offers because they are copies reproductions are considered fraudulent and are not permitted please do not attempt to use them all the offers that were properly printed through our facebook application can be redeemed any copy of any coupon or anything printed or reproduced from any other source other than through the authorized facebook application may not be accepted at the register we are working with all industry players to address this issue and are saddened by the fact that a few can try to ruin it for the many we hope to resolve these issues quickly so we can keep the good deals

5769937 at that time the county attorneys office had serious reservations about the legality of such a program
5769938 concluded the fdas position was that nearly all prescription drug imports violated federal law and that u s made drugs could only be imported by their original manufacturer
5769939 with this new resolution in hand the county executive and human resources office will revisit the issue and work with the county legislature to see if its feasible and if it will save albany county money

5769947 trans fat is a harmful artificial fat that is the worst kind of fat and should not be consumed at all its formed when a liquid oil goes through a chemical process called partial hydrogenation which converts the liquid to a semi solid consistency
5769948 the result a good fat is turned into a bad fat
5769949 dietary trans fats have been linked to the increased risk of heart disease which is the leading cause of death in the united states not only that but evidence suggests that trans fat raises bad cholesterol ldl and lowers good cholesterol hdl which leads to clogged arteries and strokes dont be alarmed there are ways to avoid them
