9390004 the word glacial used to imply that something was very slow
9390005 this new evidence from the past paired with our model for predicting future climate indicates that glacial is anything but slow past icesheets responded quickly to a changing climate hinting at the potential for a similar response in the future
9390006 we have never seen an ice sheet retreat significantly or even disappear before yet this may happen for the greenland icesheet in the coming centuries to millennia
9390007 the new work suggests that future reductions of the greenland ice sheet on the order of one metre 3 25 feet per century are not out of the question

9390033 immunisation and vaccination provide an essential tool in improving public health and the introduction of the hpv vaccination programme is a hugely significant step however success requires an investment not just in vaccine delivery but also in the health promotion measures necessary to create a supportive educational and organizational environment education is not an add on but a pre requisite

9390040 i thought a 66 or a 65 would be a great round
9390041 starting this year i decided to tell myself something similar to what vijay told himself last week that im a great putter and that im a lot better than people think and people write
9390042 so today was a good reflection and if you look at my putting stats for the year im one of the great putters on tour

9390047 was staying at a country place in scotland but broke off his vacation to visit edinburgh where he hung around the telegraph office and newsstands just in case the democratic convention meeting in denver should nominate him for the presidency the absurdity of this expectation can be tested if we remember that he had never at that point held or even run for public office never in fact attended a democratic convention
9390048 we are not advocates of sanctions and consider them to be a last resort
9390049 i have taken this decision and there is no turning back

9390051 russias military hostility against the small state of georgia could have a domino effect in other countries of the region like ukraine
9390052 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9390053 absolutely in accordance with international law in georgia and suggested that eu leaders pushing for tough measures were serving us interests
9390054 whatever happens and whatever is being said truth is on our side
9390055 we acted absolutely and morally in accordance with international law
9390056 if some european countries want to serve someone elses foreign policy interests then we cant stop them

9390060 no caso ao que parece nem a pr pria abin tem explica es convincentes para epis dios como esse da intercepta o telef nica do presidente do supremo tribunal federal a minha preocupa o tanto maior quando se sabe que a abin n o pol cia judici ria e portanto n o pode fazer investiga o criminal sendo assim nem por ordem judicial ela poderia interceptar comunica es telef nicas

9390069 i keep raising the number because it just keeps holding better than expected
9390070 this is kind of an inauspicious end to a really incredible summer
9390071 this is a point of national concern i think everybody of good will has great empathy and sympathy for people in new orleans
9390072 most religious people are praying for people in new orleans there is no political connotation to this whatsoever this was just poking fun at jerry falwell and the nonsensical thing he had said several years ago
9390073 i dont believe in a god thats vengeful i believe in a god thats compassionate
9390074 a storm is not a partisan event and that is what theyve done i am outraged
9390075 we do have extensive plans to respond wherever the storm is going to go
9390076 we believe our systems are extremely reliable but when youre facing a storm approaching 150 or more miles per hour there are no sure bets
9390077 i dont think i can do another katrina but i can definitely do what were doing today because its smooth its effective and its getting the job done
9390078 and well be able to get our people back with little hassle
9390079 because i do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of emergency personnel
9390080 we sent a message out to the country three years ago that was absolutely horrendous and we know that
9390081 they took all the criticism all that happened and applied some processes that are working
9390082 in nagins case what he has to do is be a leader of all people in new orleans and quietly solidly execute
9390083 no flamboyance no loudness no treatment of the media one way or the other just keep your head down and do this well
9390084 and its going to show that im thinking most of its going to work its going to show some weaknesses on the west bank which we expect so its going to give people more confidence to come back and rebuild after this storm is over
9390085 we really dont have the luxury of sort of trying to evaluate the politics of this kind of situation
9390086 i think we take it as it is and right now we have a horrible storm bearing down on the gulf people should be more concerned about that than a political campaign and i think thats the way were going to let the chips fall
9390087 we did what we did because it was a pretty easy call
9390088 he had a tremendous run out of turn 12 and helio crossed over almost the entire width of the track to impede the progress of the car behind him
9390089 well take any delegate that would like to go back
9390090 the mccain campaign has assured me this is the first priority
9390091 im trying to get my family out of there and stay here for the week
9390092 as important as this convention is the safety and welfare of american citizens is the no 1 priority so everything is being adjusted but not canceled
9390093 i just felt nervous having them there in this storm and me not being there
9390094 may your troubles be less and your blessings be more and nothing but happiness come through your door
9390095 we are just seeing a lot more categories 4 and 5 globally than we have ever seen
9390096 the years 2004 2005 and 2007 are quite high were just seeing more and more
9390097 and since gustav is a very strong storm youd expect gustav to have had an effect from human induced global warming
9390098 but the dominant effect in my mind is just bad luck
9390099 you hear all the horror stories from that year but when you think about it it was really something special we went through
9390100 it wasnt anything we signed up for but to be a member of that team im proud of that and the way we hung together i feel like this team can handle the exact same things and be successful
9390101 i dont think it will be overnight i think it will happen incrementally
9390102 our job until we leave whenever that is is to continue training the iraqi police training the iraqi army giving them advice and continuing to be a force for stability
9390103 there are things here that i can do without for sure things that we brought here in the bad old days that i simply dont need anymore
9390104 everyone here is working 15 to 20 hours a day
9390105 that is in the marine dna to be in a real fight but this is the toughest part of what we have been doing here putting the plug in the insurgency its very intellectual and requires a tremendous amount of patience
9390106 its taken a long time to get to this point and certainly mistakes were made on the ground in anbar
9390107 things were done that perhaps in retrospect alienated people and caused them to move against us
9390108 may your troubles be less and your blessings be more and nothing but happiness come through your door
9390109 it goes without saying but john is an all time great safety one of the leagues classiest professionals and his elite play speaks for itself
9390110 as has been the case in other situations i would not rule anything out down the road
9390111 i have no regrets about my time thus far with the patriots
9390112 the immense respect that ive long held for the organization has been only heightened over the past couple of weeks i am going to keep all options open and look forward with excitement to see what the future brings
9390113 este um furac o grande e perigoso ainda com for a e eu encorajo a todos que saiam
9390114 n o posso correr esse risco tantas pessoas morreram com o katrina
9390115 ainda prov vel que o gustav se torne uma desgra a para a regi o e coloque a em risco de sustentar danos significativos ou enormes
9390116 itll be the same as it was with the blacks sir theyll go on falling downstairs until they get the message
9390117 we do not employ women anne except at factory level and we have no present intention of doing so women arent good at business and it wouldnt be fair on the men
9390118 no only in the factory and that leads nowhere your mother tells me you went to oxford frankly thats a disadvantage there is no room in industry for educated women the men dont like them
9390119 the alliance between isbm and springer marks a new era in which isbms goal of promoting the application of behavioral and social science to improve health on a global scale is closer to becoming a reality springers impressive resources will ensure that a growing cadre of international researchers clinicians and public health professionals in new member societies in for example south africa china and brazil will have access to a rapidly expanding body of knowledge
9390120 springer has a vibrant program in behavioral medicine and public health we are excited about our collaboration with isbm and the addition of their journal to our behavioral sciences portfolio i am especially cognizant of the fact that much of the research submitted to ijbm comes from outside the usa which serves the societys and springers shared goal of dispensing peer reviewed behavioral science research to the global academic and clinical community
9390121 were going to make sure that equal pay for equal work is a reality in this country
9390122 seems like a very engaging person nice person but ive got to say shes opposed like john mccain is to equal pay for equal work that doesnt make much sense to me
9390123 i am all in favor of pay equity for women but this kind of legislation opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
9390124 were going to invest 15 billion a year in making highly efficient cars of the future right here in ohio right here in america

9390131 my thumbs are numb from the blackberry exchanges between yesterday and today in terms of shifting our coverage
9390132 after a certain point though mother natures going to have her say
9390133 when we take a hit like this it not only affects the growers but it can trickle through the entire sugar economy
9390134 one of the things we found out after katrina and rita was that the plants came back faster than the surrounding communities
9390135 where the workers are and getting them back is going to be tricky thing
9390136 its awful when youre in one but the fact is the u s economy is so big that these things just dont matter that much economically
9390137 katrina was a real mess and caused something like 25 billion in damage but if you lose 20 billion or 25 billion in the context of a 10 trillion economy its not really a very big deal
9390138 how many times are the other 49 states going to be willing
9390139 there was talk the first time around about whether it was worth it those kinds of comments might be better received this time
9390140 as you remember during hurricane katrina we didnt have a system like that in place and it was very difficult for families to locate family members
9390141 explorers dont leave fellow explorers lost we want to find out what happened to our friend and colleague no more and no less
9390142 while i feel hes under our nose here hes in an area thats extremely hard to get to its the vertical terrain its the dark terrain and its the trees the vegetation
9390143 if that aircraft didnt go straight down and kind of angled in under a stand of pine trees its going to take someone physically walking upon that scene to find it
9390144 its hard to believe in this day and age that someone could disappear like this until you go up in an aircraft and look at how rough the terrain is its absolutely amazing
9390145 if we dont find steve fossett people are going to be coming out here for the next 50 years until he is found
9390146 a window unit air conditioner or the size of a shopping cart or a washing machine it could just be scattered debris

9390160 this was a tremendous coordinated effort and achievement by the raider brigade soldiers
9390161 then there are two soldiers who keep the rear of the aerostat steady they are called the snubber line operators
9390162 when the aerostat is safely airborne in accordance with all pre post flight procedures the soldiers take up positions in the ground base system to operate the camera and watch the actions of the aerostat
9390163 it is definitely different and challenging one that i will never forget
9390164 the aerostat is an excellent tool for my professional progression
9390165 i was scared being a flight director because i was the lowest ranking soldier making crucial decisions

9390172 its difficult when fans are having a go at you after only two games
9390173 they think every tamil speaking person is a terrorist they want to control us
9390174 no one suggests for the moment that there should not be security measures and precautions
9390175 at the same time we need to be a lot more serious in finding the balance between democratic rights and human rights and the right security measures we cant alienate an entire community an entire section of the citizenry
9390176 the root cause of this is the unresolved ethnic issue
9390177 it is not a bed of roses you have to undergo certain kinds of inconveniences
9390178 i really dont think it is discrimination it is for their own good
9390179 there were so many threats to colombo and the vicinity therefore we had to carry out search operations
9390180 we were trying to survive on just water for the last 10 days but its not enough
9390181 we were trapped with nothing after our houses were swept away
9390182 we have sent packets of rice and sugar to the stranded
9390183 the situation is definitely bad but now the army has joined in and rescue operations will be speeded up
9390184 a federal appeals court ruled that saudi arabia and four of its princes cant be held liable for the september 11 terrorist attacks even if they were aware that charitable donations to muslim groups would be funneled to al qada
9390185 the 2nd u s circuit court of appeals said the defendants were protected by sovereign immunity and the plaintiffs would need to prove that the princes engaged in intentional actions aimed at u s residents
9390186 brought by charleston s c plaintiffs lawyer ronald l motley on behalf of 3 000 families of those who died and survivors of the attacks the suit alleges that members of the saudi royal family and other saudi entities sponsored the attacks by financing terrorism through a global financial network the lawsuit alleges racketeering conspiracy wrongful death and negligence
9390187 settlement may clear way for full u s diplomatic ties
9390188 second circuit judges dennis jacobs and jose cabranes and sitting by designation eastern district of new york judge eric vitaliano said the act most obviously protects the kingdom itself
9390189 but the circuit held for the first time that the act applies to individual officials of foreign governments in their official capacities a ruling that means immunity for prince salman bin abdulaziz al saud president of the commission crown prince sultan bin abdulaziz al saud chairman of the supreme council of islamic affairs prince naif bin abdulaziz al saud interior minister and prince turki al faisal bin abdulaziz al saud director of the department of general intelligence
9390190 in its ruling thursday the circuit upheld an opinion of the late southern district of new york judge richard c
9390191 the court also found that none of the exceptions to sovereign immunity in the act apply including the exception for state sponsored terrorist acts in 28 u s c 1605 a the reason jacobs explained was that saudi arabia has not been designated by the united states as a state sponsor of terror
9390192 lawsuits seeking billions of dollars in damages were filed by representatives survivors and relatives of the victims of the 9 11 attacks against foreign governments charities financial institutions and individuals believed to have provided support to al qada the plaintiffs claimed the defendants gave money to charities in order to funnel it to terrorist organizations behind the attacks on the world trade center and pentagon
9390193 construing that the meaning of the term agency is any thing or person through which action is accomplished and
9390194 t he act made clear it did not delegate to victims their counsel and the courts the responsibility of the executive branch to make americans foreign policy response to acts of terrorism committed by a foreign state including whether federal courts may entertain a victims claim for damages
9390195 you get paid for doing that it must be fun
9390196 the last metroid is in captivity the galaxy is at peace
9390197 i loved coke i never did a lot just a little bit at parties
9390198 but what ended it for me was when they caught klaus barbie the butcher of lyon in the early 80s he was hiding in south america and living off the proceeds of being a cocaine baron and i read that in the paper and all the cards fell into place and i saw how my little sniff of cocaine at a party had an absolute direct route to this fucking horrible man in south america
9390199 until that moment i had never grasped the full horrifying structure of what brings coke to our parties in britain
9390200 ive always had big tits and blonde hair thats an can be a terrible disadvantage
9390201 because youre not allowed to be intelligent if youre a woman with big tits and blonde hair and if you are it offends people intelligence does not fit into that package and you are patronised condescended and insulted professionally

9390206 i have been given all authority in heaven and on earth

9390208 so let everyone in israel know for certain that god has made this jesus whom you crucified to be both lord and messiah
9390209 each of you must repent of your sins and turn to god and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins then you will receive the gift of the holy spirit
9390210 this variability makes detecting any long term trends in tropical cyclone activity difficult
9390211 we closed the airports to tell them we can do this on a much much bigger scale if they dont listen to us
9390212 a lot of people paid 15 000 baht 240 to hire taxis to make sure they got their connections in bangkok
9390213 its been difficult protesters were sitting on the runways but they have reopened the airport just in time people were trying to get us to sign petitions i didnt want to get involved i didnt expect an attempted coup here

9390237 de in cio eu n o me preocupei demasiadamente porque atribu os fatos a um a odamento no curso de investiga es criminais agora essa preocupa o se tornou mais s ria porque percebi que aquela clandestinidade de escutas telef nicas sinaliza total descontrole por parte dos pr prios escal es superiores de rg os como a pol cia federal e a abin
9390238 no caso ao que parece nem a pr pria abin tem explica es convincentes para epis dios como esse da intercepta o telef nica do presidente do supremo tribunal federal a minha preocupa o tanto maior quando se sabe que a abin n o pol cia judici ria e portanto n o pode fazer investiga o criminal sendo assim nem por ordem judicial ela poderia interceptar comunica es telef nicas

9390244 a gente sempre quer mais e n o pode se contentar com um empate mas n o podemos esquecer que a partida era um cl ssico contra uma equipe qualificada e na casa do advers rio
9390245 as duas equipes tiveram bons momentos dentro do jogo e qualquer uma poderia ter vencido
9390246 o primeiro tempo foi mais do s o paulo e boa parte do segundo do santos o resultado foi justo e chegamos a quatro jogos sem derrota estamos melhorando gradativamente
9390247 precisamos melhorar a qualidade no passe final no futebol quanto mais simples melhor vamos seguir trabalhando a equipe em cima dos advers rios para n o sermos surpreendidos
9390248 n o sa ram gols porque um time soube neutralizar os pontos fortes do outro mas a partida poderia ter terminado 1 a 1 ou 2 a 2

9390292 yeah there are certain network settings where if youre in a very specific network environment it wont work with another persons connection and thats whats happening but thats something were already addressing by working with microsoft to get a patch out as fast as possible
9390293 were trying to get it out as soon as possible because we know its important to people
9390294 ive played through half the game with a friend online and it runs fine and when it works it runs like its local but theres those certain people whose connections we have problems with and thats exactly the problem were onto its that certain connection where two people just dont work but were on it the good news is that itll work at least half the time

9390303 the photographer had an idea which i thought was good aesthetically that there would be a mist of water between him and me but when i got to the shoot there was this bloke on a ladder with a bucket of water which he kept throwing over me i only got mildly aggressive towards the end
9390304 tall and lithe and tanned with big brown eyes and a sexual charisma that envelops you like a kidnappers sack over your head
9390305 for the three years i was in school training to be an actor i was told its very unlikely youll work at all on the stage or in film so i feel i have to take all the opportunities i can im terribly lucky theres a constant fear that it could end at any moment to stay lucky i have to work at it
9390306 you know the problem with this whole career is that you get sucked into a whirlwind and other people make choices for you
9390307 were no longer together and that is probably because ive spent too many hours concentrating on my career its very tough on a relationship
9390308 hunk who plays sense and sensibilitys willoughby is a cad in real life too
9390309 theres only so much you can do of trying finding yourself very close to getting a part and then not getting it
9390310 there are probably only a certain number of people who can understand or tolerate how long a job will take and what demands it puts on you and why should they it breeds a strange kind of selfishness immersing yourself in a character for so long
9390311 we want to pigeonhole things and people but it is absurd to regard me just as a furry wig and britches actor
9390312 yes but i was also wearing a pink spandex leotard in mamma mia
9390313 i never thought it would be a huge success but i really wanted the part because it was alan bennett
9390314 i went round to his house for tea the other day hes such a lovely man
9390315 oh right id better be careful here because i dont want to make it seem im endorsing copping a feel by teachers but it was certainly a story that needed to be told
9390316 keira was lovely to act with but there were something like 73 layers of petticoat to get through you wonder that they managed to get any action at all in those days
9390317 you know youve arrived when headlines say that the story is wonderful about this middle class girl who is seduced by my character whos a kind of glamorous rachman type criminal who charms old ladies over tea into giving him their houses im slimy repellent and glamorous
9390318 its really exciting going round the world with meryl streep pierce brosnan and colin firth being treated like royalty but i really relish being back in london playing football and getting kicked shitless by mates in dulwich ive known since i was five its a relief to be treated as a numbskull you know

9390334 in december 2007 i was offered the position of investigator to focus on an unsolved double homicide from 1999
9390335 our chief of police darryl griffis read an internet article about dr bonds work at the university of leicester and northamptonshire police in developing latent prints on fired casings and it was decided that we should attempt to have our casings tested
9390336 we contacted dr bond and were invited to bring the evidence to northampton for processing in the hope that that with the leicester process a latent fingerprint might be located on the actual casing s itself which would help to bring more evidence against a possible suspect
9390337 this will be my first visit to the u k and i look forward to meeting with dr bond his staff and the members of the northamptonshire police
9390338 your process was one of many avenues located on the internet which showed promise towards assisting us on this case
9390339 we are hopeful that we may be able to assist colleagues in the kingsland police department georgia with the techniques we have developed recently we have already had some success at enhancing partial fingerprints on shell casings for other police forces where the cases were some years old and conventional fingerprinting techniques had been tried and failed
9390340 you are 100 percent safe and the captain will make sure that we are 100 percent safe
9390341 while such geoscale interventions may be risky the time may well come when they are accepted as less risky than doing nothing
9390342 there is increasingly the sense that governments are failing to come to grips with the urgency of setting in place measures that will assuredly lead to our planet reaching a safe equilibrium
9390343 the carbon numbers just dont add up and we need to be looking at other options namely geo engineering to give us time to let the world come to its senses
9390344 at the moment its almost like talking about how we could stop world war two with an atomic bomb but we havent done the research to develop nuclear fission
9390345 largely speculative and unproven and with the risk of unknown side effects
9390346 im not a huge fan of messing with the atmosphere in an geo engineering sense because there could be unpredictable consequences but there are also a lot of unpredictable consequences of temperature increase it does appear that were failing to act on emissions and if we are failing to act then we have to consider some of the other options
9390347 its not clear which of these geo engineering technologies might work still less what environmental and social impacts they might have or whether it could ever be prudent or politically acceptable to adopt any of them but it is worth devoting effort to clarifying both the feasibility and any potential downsides of the various options none of these technologies will provide a get out of jail free card and they must not divert attention away from efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases
9390348 we cant afford to wait for magical geo engineering solutions to get us out of the hole we have dug ourselves into the solutions that exist now such as a large scale energy efficiency programme and investment in wind wave and solar power can do the job if we deploy them at the scale and urgency that is needed

9390365 financially im kind of scared most of the time because what should happen if my health and my body fail
9390366 we have people who are healthier who are living longer and have more economic reasons to stay in the work force
9390367 on the employer side you have greater demand for experienced older workers that all adds up to longer work lives
9390368 but after i retired before they called me i really didnt have anything to do so when they called i jumped on it
9390369 if theres some project to be done next year when they call ill just go do it
9390370 its always been a good idea but right now it can be an especially good idea
9390371 you really dont want to be pulling more money out of a portfolio thats already down
9390372 to me the ideal would be 70 because you get the biggest social security benefit possible and all those additional years of employment and it keeps you going mentally and physically too
9390373 i feel blessed with the good health that i have but im a little bit bitter because i dont think i should be scared financially at 68
9390374 that hurts me to see that some of these people are supporting their grandchildren
9390375 never again never again will a disaster of this nature be handled in the disgraceful way it was handled
9390376 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans
9390377 everything they need from the federal government to prepare for what all anticipate will be a difficult situation
9390378 i have every expectation we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9390379 there is uk margin and there is uk reputation the two are very linked and that is a lesson hard learned
9390380 itll be the same as it was with the blacks sir theyll go on falling downstairs until they get the message
9390381 we do not employ women anne except at factory level and we have no present intention of doing so women arent good at business and it wouldnt be fair on the men
9390382 no only in the factory and that leads nowhere your mother tells me you went to oxford frankly thats a disadvantage there is no room in industry for educated women the men dont like them
9390383 with regard to compensation mr way reminded members that the contract was with the secretary of state and that currently it was considered the nhs as a whole was failing to deliver more substantially than bt
9390384 all problems encountered to be used in the event that a claim proves possible
9390385 clinics were reduced in some areas and issues with bookings meant that some clinics and operating theatres were not operating at their usual capacity
9390386 as you would expect with such a major system being implemented in large and complex organisations there have been some difficulties in the early stages however these have eased as staff have got used to the new system patients and staff are now seeing the benefit of a more efficient it system and we expect the improvements to continue as the system rolls out
9390387 there are no trusts which are making claims against bt the issues that have been reported are bedding down issues
9390388 i loved coke i never did a lot just a little bit at parties
9390389 but what ended it for me was when they caught klaus barbie the butcher of lyon in the early 80s he was hiding in south america and living off the proceeds of being a cocaine baron and i read that in the paper and all the cards fell into place and i saw how my little sniff of cocaine at a party had an absolute direct route to this fucking horrible man in south america
9390390 until that moment i had never grasped the full horrifying structure of what brings coke to our parties in britain
9390391 ive always had big tits and blonde hair thats an can be a terrible disadvantage
9390392 because youre not allowed to be intelligent if youre a woman with big tits and blonde hair and if you are it offends people intelligence does not fit into that package and you are patronised condescended and insulted professionally
9390393 only in exceptional circumstances and then only for the shortest time necessary
9390394 i am very worried about the welfare of this little boy in detention not just as his lawyer but as a father of three children of similar age i am extremely concerned at the uks policy here why in a modern day society are we locking up minors

9390396 prepared to accept that in certain circumstances those in possession of the satanic verses may find themselves in serious difficulties in iran
9390397 i wouldnt be surprised if it was still a problem having a copy in iran
9390398 we expected to see evidence of big improvements since our last investigation but weve been sadly disappointed with so many of us buying our foods at these supermarkets their collective behaviour can heavily influence the nations eating habits despite their claims the supermarkets all still have a long way to go to help customers choose and enjoy a healthy diet
9390399 these retailers have shown a real commitment to more responsible retailing and making their customers health a priority although more work needs to be done across the sector to curb unhealthy food promotion
9390400 one off snap shot in one english city last march
9390401 misleading comparisons to unfairly criticise retailers records on encouraging healthier food choices
9390402 customers will have seen for themselves the current high profile price war centred on fruit and vegetables
9390403 its six months out of date contains a number of inaccuracies and is a largely subjective assessment
9390404 we include frozen and tinned fruit and vegetables supermarkets could discount what is there and we did not find they were doing so a spot check like this is totally fair we set out to replicate what it is like for a normal shopper
9390405 this did not happen automatically caffe observes that the response of the people against violence and the manner in which various sections of the community reacted to the atrocious pre election situation created a situation which prevented violence and violations
9390406 the initiation of a campaign which was neither free nor fair launched six months ago cannot be removed by maintaining law and order only on the day of the election

9390411 the biggest significance of this deal is that cnpc will benefit as the first international oil company to be developing one of the giant discovered oil fields in iraq in the new era
9390412 i have championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress
9390413 in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9390414 if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9390415 the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9390416 the money thats been appropriated for the project it should remain available for a link an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done
9390417 this link is a commitment to help ketchikan expand its access to help this community prosper
9390418 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9390419 she was asked about the bridge and she supported it
9390420 how could she have foreseen that she would be at this point now everybody is surprised by this development
9390421 of course when you become governor things come into much sharper focus than when you are a candidate
9390422 then she is forced to pay very close attention to the fiscal realities of it
9390423 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values like you work hard for what you want in life

9390440 excess folate especially in the form of folic acid can fuel lesion growth accelerating progression into life threatening cancers because high levels of the vitamin make it easier for tumour cells to copy themselves

9390445 deep massage of the joint is likely to produce results in mild problems in cases where the ligament ruptures or tears then a full medical examination is required with likely referral to an orthopaedic doctor for further investigation and treatment

9390448 she is very stubborn she thinks she is still the collette waller she was at 24 she is the strongest person i have ever known the mental strength the jolliness you get out of her even now is amazing you can tell when she is happy from her eyes
9390449 the thing she dreads most is ending up in a home then she would lose everything because i wouldnt be able to live with her
9390450 i had to carry her up the steps from the beach
9390451 i dont want to ruin it i am happy as i am

9390468 we spent weeks and weeks talking to people in the less fortunate areas of colombo to talk about peoples problems we used the people that we met in our research and created the 23 lives and the 23 characters with their dreams and their problems and aspirations into our film
9390469 they think they can make their money within no time if they come here but when they come here theyll have to do anything they are ready to do anything to make money so otherwise they wont fulfil their dreams

9390474 we need to take care of the monuments and art works in this city and to do that we need a hand from sponsors
9390475 they already tried to cover the milan duomo with neon panels 12 years ago
9390476 this is a lesser evil given that resources are short and monuments are falling to pieces
9390477 the money prompts greed and i suspect that works get stretched out to fill coffers it happened at porta venezia in milan where a four month job lasted two and a half years

9390485 our forces are ready to take the security responsibility tomorrow monday
9390486 they are controlling the situation our troops are on alert to avert any failure of the transfer
9390487 we are happy that iraqi forces will be in control now of the security rather than the foreign troops that is how it should be iraqis should protect the iraqis
9390488 our forces are not ready to take responsibility for the situation i am sorry to say but there is lot of corruption in our security forces
9390489 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
9390490 we have written a page in history now we will have fewer illegal immigrants leaving from the coast of libya and coming to us and more libyan oil and gas
9390491 the libyans feel they were very badly treated and this is still an issue
9390492 but having said that i think one has to look at the 5bn figure with a sceptical eye
9390493 i think there is an element of smoke and mirrors
9390494 i see it as the two governments here seeking to thicken the commercial relationship between them
9390495 what happened in libya could spur the algerians to renew their demand to an apology
9390496 here there is consensus on the popular level that an apology is needed though not on the political level french interests in algeria are too huge and there are some in power and in the opposition who do not want to anger the french
9390497 i have championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress
9390498 in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9390499 if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9390500 the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9390501 the money thats been appropriated for the project it should remain available for a link an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done
9390502 this link is a commitment to help ketchikan expand its access to help this community prosper
9390503 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9390504 she was asked about the bridge and she supported it
9390505 how could she have foreseen that she would be at this point now everybody is surprised by this development

9390507 the claims come after the coalition was also accused of killing more than 90 people including 60 children in air strikes in the west a week ago a charge it denies
9390508 five civilians including two women and a child were killed in an air strike by coalition forces early this morning
9390509 after a certain point though mother natures going to have her say
9390510 when we take a hit like this it not only affects the growers but it can trickle through the entire sugar economy
9390511 one of the things we found out after katrina and rita was that the plants came back faster than the surrounding communities
9390512 where the workers are and getting them back is going to be tricky thing
9390513 its awful when youre in one but the fact is the u s economy is so big that these things just dont matter that much economically
9390514 katrina was a real mess and caused something like 25 billion in damage but if you lose 20 billion or 25 billion in the context of a 10 trillion economy its not really a very big deal
9390515 we do have extensive plans to respond wherever the storm is going to go
9390516 this is a point of national concern i think everybody of good will has great empathy and sympathy for people in new orleans
9390517 most religious people are praying for people in new orleans there is no political connotation to this whatsoever this was just poking fun at jerry falwell and the nonsensical thing he had said several years ago
9390518 i dont believe in a god thats vengeful i believe in a god thats compassionate
9390519 a storm is not a partisan event and that is what theyve done
9390520 im optimistic above all because of the game that ronaldinho had
9390521 it was a strange game one of those surprises that can happen at the beginning of the season we played a good game we attacked for 90 minutes and there were two instances when bologna was better than us
9390522 it was an open game that could have gone either way
9390523 pity because we could have won this game if we had pressed more in the first half
9390524 we did what we did because it was a pretty easy call
9390525 he had a tremendous run out of turn 12 and helio crossed over almost the entire width of the track to impede the progress of the car behind him
9390526 i dont think it will be overnight i think it will happen incrementally
9390527 our job until we leave whenever that is is to continue training the iraqi police training the iraqi army giving them advice and continuing to be a force for stability
9390528 there are things here that i can do without for sure things that we brought here in the bad old days that i simply dont need anymore
9390529 everyone here is working 15 to 20 hours a day
9390530 that is in the marine dna to be in a real fight but this is the toughest part of what we have been doing here putting the plug in the insurgency its very intellectual and requires a tremendous amount of patience
9390531 its taken a long time to get to this point and certainly mistakes were made on the ground in anbar
9390532 things were done that perhaps in retrospect alienated people and caused them to move against us
9390533 were moving from a consumer driven economy to one being more led by exports

9390538 if youre good at dressing 7 to 14 year old girls it doesnt necessarily make you good at dressing teenage girl or a 25 year old
9390539 its tough to wait it out if youre not outperforming in this environment
9390540 theres no question abercrombie has figured out the teen segment pretty darn well
9390541 but theyve clearly missed on young adult segment with ruehl
9390542 its fair to say that well be watching the sales trend in ruehl very closely as we get to the end of the year and beginning of next year
9390543 so far im greatly encouraged but i recognize headwinds remain challenging
9390544 you have to give their management team a ton of credit for their discipline and focus
9390545 its tough to be in an early stage of growth in this environment its very touch and go
9390546 i wouldnt be a bit surprised if we see more fall out
9390547 why are residential rate payers paying more than their fair share if this is all about them paying their fair share
9390548 many folks like to look at elements of the package in a micro sense but looking at it from a macro sense the costs of doing nothing are going to be much more
9390549 if you look at the type of use how many hours per day the energy is taken some difference might be justified but not a factor of two
9390550 all i can say is the amounts paid by various rate classes vary in a number of complex ways the general thrust has been to try to have rate parity
9390551 were looking at all aspects and trying to make it as fair as possible

9390564 dissolving parliament is a way for the government to show responsibility if you dont want to take the responsibility on your own by resigning take all of parliament members with you by dissolving it
9390565 i will not resign or dissolve parliament i will not be defeated by those protesters
9390566 dont you feel ashamed our image as far as the rest of the world sees us will be destroyed i am the one who has taken the helm of the country the decision should be mine
9390567 i am sure that i love this country as much as anybody
9390568 but i love democracy much more more than anyone who told me to resign
9390569 some guys that are hungry to win for the first time guys that havent won many times and im trying to do the same thing i just want to keep playing my type of golf hopefully i can hit it a little better and find a few more fairways
9390570 i have to go out there and play good golf
9390571 i have to go out there and just go around the golf course and win i think the guys that are leading are playing good golf
9390572 i thought a 66 or a 65 would be a great round
9390573 starting this year i decided to tell myself something similar to what vijay told himself last week that im a great putter and that im a lot better than people think and people write
9390574 so today was a good reflection and if you look at my putting stats for the year im one of the great putters on tour
9390575 its time to step it up and give a little kick on my butt and join them so ive been working on that
9390576 he accomplished a no hitter and wasnt given what he deserved that should have been a no hitter
9390577 thats a stinking no hitter we all got cheated from i feel horrible for cc
9390578 thats a joke that wasnt even close whoever the scorekeeper was absolutely denied major league baseball a nice no hitter right there
9390579 they threw hit up on the board even before laroche hit the bag
9390580 the ball was still rolling and i probably should have picked it up with my glove we probably wouldnt be having this conversation
9390581 i think if i pick it up with my glove i get him
9390582 id like to think it was a hit from a selfish standpoint id like it to be a hit but you could make a case either way but im hitting 160 i need every hit i can get
9390583 hes been dominant since he came over and hopefully he and rest of the team will take us to the promised land
9390584 its fun to watch him pitch unfortunately he was on the other side
9390585 most people think its fake fur and when they find out its real and it takes one bear to make a hat they are appalled
9390586 the mod is not opposed to the use of synthetic materials as an alternative to bearskins provided such materials meet the requirement for a high quality product that performs adequately in all weather conditions regrettably a suitable alternative continues to prove elusive
9390587 we need to be on stage we need to show our country we need to dance for our country
9390588 we want to show who we are what we do and that art is something else we can talk about
9390589 people need a sense of community in times of both peace and strife if this can be promoted then it means they are less likely to kill each other
9390590 i was a bit surprised but delighted at how popular the dance programme was with everyone
9390591 dorian gray is a known story so people can relate to it but i realised how he had actually made it very much a statement about our times which could embrace both american psycho and david beckham
9390592 we cant accept the world order where all decisions are made by one nation even by such serious and authoritative nation as the united states such a world would be unstable and prone to conflicts
9390593 russia doesnt want to engage in confrontation with anyone russia doesnt want to isolate itself
9390594 the partnership should not be the kind between the horseman and the horse but of two equal individuals
9390595 send russia a clear united message that her aggression will not be rewarded
9390596 the message from gordon from alistair from colleagues like myself has been the same
9390597 we have had a very good period of economic success which has for sure provided us with a very serious platform to weather these problems
9390598 effectively when armed personnel return there is no help for them
9390599 i have come to the conclusion that if proper treatment was available for these disturbed servicemen hundreds if not thousands would not have offended
9390600 the government is letting them and their families down very badly indeed
9390601 i kept quite still and said nothing for a whole hour i did not move a muscle and in the meantime i did not hear him lie down he was still sitting up in the bed listening just as i have done night after night hearkening to the death watches in the wall
9390602 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
9390603 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
9390604 itll be the same as it was with the blacks sir theyll go on falling downstairs until they get the message
9390605 we do not employ women anne except at factory level and we have no present intention of doing so women arent good at business and it wouldnt be fair on the men
9390606 no only in the factory and that leads nowhere your mother tells me you went to oxford frankly thats a disadvantage there is no room in industry for educated women the men dont like them
9390607 we expected to see evidence of big improvements since our last investigation but weve been sadly disappointed with so many of us buying our foods at these supermarkets their collective behaviour can heavily influence the nations eating habits despite their claims the supermarkets all still have a long way to go to help customers choose and enjoy a healthy diet
9390608 these retailers have shown a real commitment to more responsible retailing and making their customers health a priority although more work needs to be done across the sector to curb unhealthy food promotion
9390609 one off snap shot in one english city last march
9390610 misleading comparisons to unfairly criticise retailers records on encouraging healthier food choices
9390611 customers will have seen for themselves the current high profile price war centred on fruit and vegetables
9390612 its six months out of date contains a number of inaccuracies and is a largely subjective assessment
9390613 we include frozen and tinned fruit and vegetables supermarkets could discount what is there and we did not find they were doing so a spot check like this is totally fair we set out to replicate what it is like for a normal shopper
9390614 i loved coke i never did a lot just a little bit at parties
9390615 klaus barbie was hiding in south america and living off the proceeds of being a cocaine baron
9390616 and i read that in the paper and all the cards fell into place and i saw how my little sniff of cocaine at a party had an absolute direct route to this f horrible man in south america
9390617 and from that day i never touched cocaine again until that moment i had never grasped the full horrifying structure of what brings coke to our parties in britain
9390618 i hated dope it always made me feel miserable and paranoid and unhappy and i woke up one day and thought no more of that thank you
9390619 and if you are it offends people intelligence does not fit into that package and you are patronised condescended and insulted professionally
9390620 i once had to dye my hair dark for a film and there was a completely different attitude
9390621 i felt people were much more taking me at face value rather than as the iconic blonde d cup woman as you get older it goes away
9390622 its a miracle shes never gone mad she is a remarkable person who has achieved an amazing thing with a life she neither chose for herself nor particularly wanted
9390623 shes never put on weight never got anorexic never gone mad
9390624 she said hello its lovely to meet you and that was about it other than horsey chat
9390625 we should probably not be surprised that for the first time in almost five years the overall order intake in the scottish engineering manufacturing sector is being reported as negative
9390626 while it is noted that price levels had been increased both in home and export markets margins continue to be severely pressed on the back of significantly higher input prices
9390627 anecdotal evidence is suggesting that while overall we have been extremely impressed by the work ethic they have brought with them there is some sign of a deterioration and this is made worse by the decision of a growing number of these workers to return to their home countries
9390628 manufacturing has shown considerable resilience in the face of a credit crunch a global economic slowdown and a massive increase in its costs but there are now clear signs that these pressures are starting to take their toll
9390629 given the bank of englands hands remain tied in the short term it is now essential the government tackles this turning point for the economy head on
9390630 it must avoid adding further costs to business and put in place policies which will provide the building blocks for an upturn
9390631 it all came upon me very quickly in the slams and i was still growing
9390632 i think im hitting the ball well i just feel like my return game needs to get better and to try and create a few more opportunities on the return
9390633 i feel like im moving well and my goal for the tournament remains to try and win it
9390634 it is my decision and i will have to stand by it
9390635 the last few weeks have been extremely tense for me along with all of us that have been trying to make the team and i realise that my elation will be matched by the disappointment of others i feel very sorry for them
9390636 obviously i am disappointed that i wasnt selected but i have dealt with much worse and it will make me all the more determined to make the team that will play in wales next time
9390637 there was a qualifying period and i didnt make it automatically so you will not hear any sour grapes from me i couldnt have tried any harder and i devoted myself to the european tour to give myself the best possible chance but although i have won twice this year it obviously wasnt enough
9390638 im surprised ian poulter didnt come back and fight for his placeand i think the morale in the team might be a bit lower for picking poulter ahead of darren clarke
9390639 i just felt there was a dead certainty for it to be darren clarke and paul casey im fairly shocked and very surprised nicks his own man and hes a controversial person there will be a few players today thinking nick i think youve made a mistake
9390640 i dont think ian poulter will let the team down but he didnt turn up to the last event and darrens the form guy ian has missed the last two cuts darren won a tournament two weeks ago in a very strong field on a tough course
9390641 i just had a sneaking feeling at the back of my mind that nick faldo would do something different
9390642 the european tour should be very proud at the quantity and quality of potential ryder cup players that it can now offer up for selection more so than at any time in my 20 years plus on tour
9390643 while i shall certainly feel sad not to be playing a part as i sit glued to the tv i know the overwhelming emotion i will be feeling is pride
9390644 darren made a massive massive charge a big effort the last few weeks its a tough call some will agree some will disagree i briefly spoke to darren and you could sense he was disappointed
9390645 monty i only managed to leave a voice message apparently he was watching football or shopping my run came to an end and the first one you miss it stinks montys had an historic career but unfortunately his summer wasnt great and hes finished down the list
9390646 it is deeply disturbing that a department as shambolic as the home office already faces such problems as a result of the economic downturn it is patently not equipped to cope why havent they prepared for this
9390647 now we see that the consequences of gordon browns complete mismanagement of the economy will not just hit hard working families in the pocket but will also threaten their security and safety across the board labour are failing in their duty to ensure the welfare of the british public
9390648 we do not normally comment on leaked documents but this is draft advice that the home secretary has not cleared and has not been sent to number 10
9390649 it is however appropriate that the home office considers the effects the economic climate may have on crime and other policy areas
9390650 ive got a loaf of bread and a slice of ham and ton of water i say my prayers every day
9390651 shes been commander in chief of the alaska national guard shes had judgment on these issues shes had 12 years of elected office experience including travelling to kuwait
9390652 hes chosen somebody who doesnt believe climate change is man made
9390653 palin equals guns babies jesus obama just lost blue collar white democratic voters in pennsylvania and other states
9390654 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them

9390656 why should my fans be killed clearly dr who is british and superior to the morally dichotomous americana in star trek but this is neo inter multiversal colonialism gone too far
9390657 to execute or not to execute that is the question

9390682 russias military hostility against the small state of georgia could have a domino effect in other countries of the region like ukraine
9390683 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9390684 absolutely in accordance with international law in georgia and suggested that eu leaders pushing for tough measures were serving us interests
9390685 whatever happens and whatever is being said truth is on our side

9390695 new orleans evacuated 10 000 people on saturday and the estimate is 30 000 people needed to leave
9390696 the challenge seems to be that people arent listening or they are listening and deciding to stay all the coastal parishes are in very significant harms way while you can it is critical to move
9390697 if people are scared they should be scared this is not a drill we just need you to move now

9390703 i almost had it at wimbledon i would hope to go a step further and have that invincibility factor again
9390704 today was pretty breezy so i tried to keep the ball in the court not on the lines so much
9390705 i returned well i moved well on the baseline i served well and thats a good sign for the rest of the tournament
9390706 im playing well not wasting any energy and moving on but the important thing is winning the tournament i dont try to impress anybody in the early rounds
9390707 to put myself in that position is always a good feeling i feel like it could happen again here

9390736 six percent for mortgage interest saved is pretty good ten percent isnt bad either both should be carefully considered
9390737 in january i paid off the 30 year adjustable rate mortgage that i took out to buy my home in1997 it took 10 years and 5 months and wasnt that hard to do i feel great
9390738 as i watch the foreclosure storm raging around me i know that i have nothing to worry about banks are more than happy to extend me a line of credit since ive got a 100 percent paid in full property with the market in the tank and my bank account flush with cash i can snap up great deals that in five to 10 years will be paying me back in spades
9390739 the benefit weve seen since paying off our mortgage is that we have been able to invest the freed up cash to max out our 401 k s which we were not able to do before even though we dont get the mortgage tax deduction we do get the deduction from investing in our 401 k s
9390740 i paid extra on my mortgage every month for years sometimes double payments i got laid off and had trouble making the payments and the bank absolutely did not care about my past payment history all they were concerned about was the last three months i had tons of equity in the house but couldnt tap it because i wasnt working i got out of it but it was a terrible position to be in

9390749 the campaign features a gospel choir in a church setting all the elements of worship are present the singing the responses from the congregation and the lifting of the hands corporate companies always like to use black people in these buffoon portrayals why can we not see adverts involving gospel choirs in dignified settings why do they always have to act like fools i believe subliminally that is the way we are often viewed by the advertising companies

9390751 in socio linguistic palaeontology aimed at unearthing previously hidden meanings and connections
9390752 macintyre rejects hegels faith in reasons ability to grasp absolute reality substituting in its place a critical blend of imre lakatos thomas kuhn and w v quines more pragmatic approaches
9390753 it is a heuristic maxim that the truth lies not in one of the two disputed views but in some third possibility which has not yet been thought of which we can only discover by rejecting something assumed as obvious by both disputants
9390754 when offered a choice between two politically intolerable alternatives it is important to choose neither and when that choice is presented in rival arguments and debates that exclude from public consideration any other set of possibilities it becomes a duty to withdraw from those arguments and debates so as to resist the imposition of this false choice by those who have arrogated to themselves the power of framing the alternatives
9390755 rationality may consequently require us to readily abandon our commitment to any world view that comes to face an overbearing obstacle
9390756 the languages in use of some social and cultural orders are more adequate than those of some others in this and that respect
9390757 the existence of continuing disagreement even between highly intelligent people should not lead us to suppose that there are not adequate resources available for the rational resolution of such disagreement

9390775 the fujifilm finepix z20fd is small and fun and offers good capability for its tiny size the 10 megapixel ccd picks up a lot of fine detail and both color and exposure performance are generally good
9390776 the z20fd isnt a terrible camera though in many ways its a good camera for the amateur user its compact stylish and affordable and takes decent shots indoors and outdoors i enjoyed using it despite all its technical faults and would recommend it regardless for people who just want an easy to use compact camera with a little flair
9390777 the viewfinder to take the pictures in the front of the camera is in the upper corner is usually where i put my left middle finger so once i found a few pictures taken with my finger in it i had to remember to keep away
9390778 i have a higher end canon 8mp and this blows those pix away ease of use and small portable size along with easy connectivity make this a real winner btw it cost 600 less than the canon
9390779 canon is pretty much the best but it lacks a couple of things i wanted that this camera has such as a non telescoping lens and a dedicated movie button the menu system is nice and relatively easy to navigate but does kick you out once you make a selection which can get annoying especially when first setting it up
9390780 well i was disappointed after only a few hours it takes lovely brightly colored pictures incredible close up macro shots but the shutter speed and response time left something to be desired
9390781 ahh exacto isso ja te ligo daqui a 10 minutos
9390782 vou ligar a ultima vez ja devem tar fartos de mim mas aquilo e uma loja
9390783 sim acho que posso pedir essa roda depois de dizerem que podiam pedir iam so confirmar o pre o espera so um bocadinho que ja te ligo diz me o teu n
9390784 2008 is an unusual year china and air china have met unprecedented challenges
9390785 the airline industry with weakening traffic demand increasing competition and high oil prices faces a long severe winter
9390786 high oil prices and the global economic slowdown will undoubtedly continue to affect the aviation industry for the rest of the year and we might also be impacted beyond 2008
9390787 the overall demand in the aviation sector is slowing down domestic passenger volume can no long sustain annual growth of 16 20 percent as it did over the past few years
9390788 while low revenue growth was dragged down by overall traffic slowdown surging jet fuel cost in the first half of 2008 has driven up total operating costs
9390789 eliminate the effects of a stronger yuan and you will find out their core business is bleeding
9390790 we expect a government mandated restructuring at some point over the next 12 months
9390791 im optimistic we were unlucky it was a strange and unusual match but i think they are the surprise of the day
9390792 i dont think we were missing much in the team we attacked for 90 minutes and were punished by the two chances bologna had
9390793 we could have been more compact and together but from a physical perspective we couldnt have done any more than that
9390794 the result was fair because we werent able to close out the match but a draw at a difficult ground is not a big drama
9390795 im not super happy but the team didnt play badly
9390796 it is too early to confirm whether the aircraft crashed into a mountain or if there are any survivors
9390797 in the first set she played quite solid i was the one who was all over the place i couldnt find my rhythm in these conditions and she took advantage of that
9390798 i stayed calm and composed and knew i had to do something to change that in the second set i did the smart things and i cruised through the second and third set
9390799 by winning a grand slam i would regain the number one ranking again its something i want to achieve again
9390800 it would be nice to come back to the number one spot
9390801 it would be great if i can do it we will see what happens
9390802 i have been injured right now i finally do not have any problems
9390803 little by little i feel like im getting better every day
9390804 i feel the shots a lot better than i did at the beginning of the tournament thats my goal get my game together by the end of the tournament
9390805 the second set i got a bit more defensive even though i was hitting the ball it wasnt going well she kept coming in and forcing play she was just better than me
9390806 im getting better each day im improving on my fitness
9390807 i can push off better little by little im putting the pieces together im bringing my game to the next level i believe in myself
9390808 i hope and pray we will be able to resume some of our normal operations as quickly as possible
9390809 were going to suspend most of our activities tomorrow except for those absolutely necessary
9390810 take off our republican hats and put on our american hats and we say america were with you
9390811 we will refrain from any political rhetoric which would be traditional in an opening session
9390812 right now we have a horrible storm bearing down on the gulf people should be more concerned about that than a political campaign and that is the way we are going to let the chips fall
9390813 we can activate an email list of a couple million people who want to give back
9390814 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9390815 in light of these events i will not be going to minnesota for the republican national convention
9390816 i will travel down to texas tomorrow to visit with the emergency operations centre in austin
9390817 shes been a commander in chief of the alaska national guard
9390818 remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9390819 im a small widget maker who linked to a big widget maker and they didnt link back
9390820 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9390821 theres very little doubt that we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action action to help our fellow citizens in this time of tragedy and disaster action in the form of volunteering donations reaching out our hands and our hearts and our wallets to the people who are under such great threat from this great natural disaster
9390822 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9390823 take off their republican hats and put on their american hats
9390824 in light of these events i will not be going to minnesota for the republican national convention
9390825 im going to travel down to texas tomorrow to visit with the emergency operations center in austin where coordination among federal state and local government officials is occurring i intend to go down to san antonio where state and local officials are prepositioning relief materials for texas and louisiana and ill have a chance to visit with residents of both states who have been evacuated
9390826 we need to be sensitive to this as we go forward

9390862 it was impossible to see the smaller and slower cars in the rain and darkness i drove at top speed and waited to hear the resonance of exhaust in front of me as soon as i could sense the location of a car in the blackness it was a flash of light the bare outline of car and driver and then back into the darkness peering ahead for the next one

9390876 es una idea poco afortunada a n cuando t cnicamente es posible es poco recomendable un acuario de ese tipo a dos mil sobre el nivel del mar en una zona donde hace falta el vital l quido y que poco a poco se est muriendo en el largo plazo la factura que nos pasar el ecosistema lacustre por esta obra ser mayor que cualquier beneficio social o econ mico
9390877 the performances too seriously to the point where it felt uncomfortable to compete
9390878 for some reason and i will not ask why that part of the program has been dropped from this years meeting
9390879 you will not hear any complaints from the american delegation about the revamped program and most especially me musical talent is not a strength
9390880 because we were crafting a new kind of intelligence that focused on the persona of world leaders and focused on the man behind the mask
9390881 part of what made him so was his ability to sympathize with his subjects
9390882 general mckiernan wants to ensure that the numbers can be reconciled somehow so its important that theres cooperation
9390883 its very surprising that the numbers are so disparate we believe that this could be because of some taliban propaganda or misinformation
9390884 we are hopeful that a collaborative inquiry will result in finding out the truth
9390885 but it needs to be broad based and it needs to include all the key players the afghans the u s military nato the united nations
9390886 i think that the main target was somewhere else and as the u s and afghan forces were passing by azizabad on the way to the target they came under attack
9390887 one of the american special forces soldiers was injured and then the special forces called for air support to bombard the village
9390888 i still dont know where the main target was supposed to be and neither does the commander of our commando unit
9390889 suddenly there were large planes above us then they bombed the house

9390891 it was difficult for us to get to the bodies and to bury them we buried five children in one grave and four children in another grave
9390892 a bunch of them have dropped nebuad like hot potatoes
9390893 we do not have any specific business updates at this point
9390894 naturally if there is a way to take a meager slice of that revenue in some way its something which companies will want to look at
9390895 they all looked at the financial opportunity and didnt think about the repercussions they didnt realize what problems they would get when they got exposed
9390896 there will be a long time to go before anyone is making any decisions with any finality
9390897 whenever the congressional committee with the regulatory authority over your industry expresses concerns with your technology
9390898 to study the issues raised about the nebuad system by your committee privacy advocates and others
9390899 we have to work out in society what we believe is a good exchange

9390901 if precautionary measures e g walking in groups protecting briefcases and handbags were taken this should prevent crimes from being committed
9390902 foreign office spokesman said that figure did not include the dress which was a personal gift from the then british ambassador sir david manning
9390903 americans have a right to know about who is proliferating especially when youre negotiating with north korea
9390904 you have a right to know this that when it comes to the six party talks proliferation the issue of proliferation has equal importance with the issue of weaponry and that north korea has said that they will stop proliferating just like they have said they will fully disclose and disable any weapons programs
9390905 step one of that has been dealing with shuttering pyongyang

9391043 it was very frustrating and that pushed me to spend a lot of time studying with different teachers so now when i am on the set and working in english i feel happy that i dont have to be thinking about the words because when i do that it takes away a lot of the freedom and the pleasure of acting im happy that nobody complains about the accent any more and i worked hard for that and im still working on it

9391066 but the weapons recovered as a result of these operations make it very clear that there are people here planning to engage in criminal behavior
9391067 together we can derail this purely ceremonial show of this repressive system and remake it with our own hands

9391152 to harass vex exert undue pressure stifle the resources of critics or opponents and burden the poor with the cost of a lengthy litigation so that they would be forced to abandon their criticism or opposition
9391153 through this system the people especially the poor who cannot afford the expenses would enjoy a quicker access to justice

9391158 this is not the panacea we all know football clubs who change managers and it doesnt make any difference
9391159 its not an easy job its a very difficult task
9391160 its not a squad like in other sports where you have squad training there are a lot of individuals
9391161 and whether charles van commenee was the boss or dave collins was the boss it wouldnt have made colin jackson run any quicker it was him and his coach that made him run quicker
9391162 so i think youve got to temper it a little bit
9391163 you need someone who has the ability to come in sees what needs to be done and get on with it
9391164 he cannot be hampered by people saying this is the way its been done in the past and the way were doing things now youve got to have someone who says no that isnt good enough
9391165 were not getting the right results for the money that is being poured into our sport its as simple as that accountability now has to come into it
9391166 theyre going to have to upset people theyll have to go in there and start carving things up making sure that its best for the athletes rather than the system
9391167 if you can get guys like charles you need someone to back him up
9391168 i would love the job theres no question about that but you have to weigh up your life im happy and would think what do i need the job for
9391169 i think from what i see he was doing a brilliant job i havent heard the criticism or negative things
9391170 hes more than capable of doing what he needs to do he has a team around him that assists him getting the team where they need to be
9391171 its not bad we were a medal short on what was predicted i think there were good performances a lot of pbs and getting into finals of tough events
9391172 they need a severe reality check as to what you need to do to survive and what you need to do to win
9391173 but they need someone that when theyre out on the warm up track just about to go out into the olympic stadium tells them this is what youve got to do
9391174 residents in winchester road solomons lane brooklyn close and other properties have been moved to jubilee hall in little shore road in bishops waltham where facilities are being provided for residents to spend the night
9391175 this is a big deal for us to have signed
9391176 its our second deal in china but this joint venture will give us an opportunity to really expand our business
9391177 what indian companies and workers bring to the table is definitely very good design and engineering skills as well as management skills
9391178 but these skills are complemented by what the chinese bring to the table
9391179 once you set the systems right and show them what you want they can achieve it in super fast time and you can work on the assumption that its going to work fine
9391180 that wouldnt happen here in india we wouldnt be able to complete a project as quickly as they are able to
9391181 theres no denying that china is cheaper than in india although it does depend what exactly youre looking for
9391182 the individual components can be cheaper by anywhere between 5 to 25 now thats not something to sneeze at
9391183 if you look at the cost of making a tractor around 70 of that is the raw material costs which are rising all the time
9391184 so finding a way to cut costs is one way to manage the higher raw material charges
9391185 i think one needs to have a bit of patience and largeness of heart
9391186 things are not always what they appear to be here in india were very process driven and we operate with very clear procedures
9391187 but in china its not like that they dont mean anything negative by it it is just the way they are
9391188 im just really excited i just cant wait to see what it looks like im just ready to start college and start my new life
9391189 my learning curve is still pretty steep however and i will continue to be listening a lot communication is critically important and to me the most vital part of communication is listening especially as the new guy on the block
9391190 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9391191 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans we have to join the 300 million other americans on behalf of our other citizens its a time for action
9391192 the last 16 years ive been sheriff and have ridden out a number of storms in the parish including katrina in my lifetime i have experienced betsy and camille looking at the path of this storm and the models i think we are in more perilous position that we have ever been at anytime of our history
9391193 who want to give back can be activated he suggested that donations could include cash goods and individual labor
9391194 what were trying to do is not only give assistance but give assistance in a pan that is laid out by the national guard and the other agencies that we can fit into rather than running to the scene of the fire
9391195 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9391196 the presidents wife is a raging bitch and a dirty cunt
9391197 ill pick up all the hillary supporter votes if i run with a woman any woman
9391198 whyd you put a bullet in that aides head mr hussein
9391199 he was trying to tell me that gassing the kurds was a bad idea he was failing to support my efforts to govern
9391200 this is a way to deliver a big favor directly from the corporate treasury
9391201 its great when you need access and you need a friend in washington
9391202 large convention donations may give the donors lobbyists more clout with those they seek to influence
9391203 its not your grandfathers agriculture anymore our membership is diverse progressive and proactive
9391204 this is about generating more interest and awareness in what we do
9391205 it would have been different in the olympics if i had run like this
9391206 but the past is the past and this is the present
9391207 i am very frustrated and disappointed with what happened in beijing
9391208 it was so frustrating having to watch rather than perform
9391209 i know i would have been the man to put pressure on bolt but thats what ive got to work towards now but i look forward to meeting usain and finishing my season strongly
9391210 its a bit difficult to come down off the high of the olympics and im still feeling a little tired
9391211 id have loved to have won but it just wasnt to be today
9391212 we all wanted to win the olympics but to beat the medalists here was nice
9391213 what does that inter connectedness of the professional community do for you
9391214 the relationships that you form in the first degree connections that you create are based on respect based on a track record with someone based on trust or based on a working relationship a true reflection of themselves and a true reflection of their personal brand
9391215 archer farms is flying but market pantry is really flying
9391216 long term you cant have sales gains only in low margin products which is one reason why the private label initiative is so important to them its got higher margins than average food items
9391217 the consumer food sector has worked hard to improve the taste quality and health and wellness of the branded products because they see the potential to gain dollars
9391218 theres also a lot more innovation companies are putting together portfolios of products like oscar mayer lunchables that have meat crackers and cheese
9391219 people are loyal to their brands but theyre becoming a lot less loyal
9391220 national brands are still an enormous piece of our business but theyre certainly not growing as fast
9391221 were trying to have great fun flavors that are a little bit out there a little bit trendy but not so weird that no one will try them

9391230 were now two weeks into the pre production for the new
9391231 our original plan was to be done with the pre production within 3 4 weeks but i have to be honest with myself the band and you of course
9391232 at this point of time we have three songs completed
9391233 so how does the new stuff sound you may ask
9391234 the material that is written so far is our most melancholic and epic yet one of the songs is what we in our terms would call a ballad
9391235 theres still a lot of work ahead of us until we have material for a whole new album but things are moving forward perhaps slow but very stabile and once we have progressed a bit further with the pre production we will give you a more detailed story of each new song so stay tuned
9391236 due to the fact that the company which was in charge of the production went bankrupt we had no other choice than to wait and postpone sometimes shit happens i know we have also promised to post a trailer for the dvd for quite some time and i hate to say this but it has also been delayed due above mentioned reasons i can however assure you that we will post a trailer as soon as we have one hopefully itll be sooner than later
9391237 we received lots of questions regarding the secrets of the moon enslaved tour which has been announced by several promoters across europe fact is we will not support enslaved on their european tour the tour has been booked with us on the bill but unfortunately we were not able to observe the first deadline of the new album we apologize for these disarrangements enslaved will of course play the tour and we wish them all the best for their upcoming album however there will be massive touring around the globe when our new album is out and we hope to announce first dates by the end of this year
9391238 due to my all dominant negativity i cannot extract a single good aspect from representing my music live on stage any more thus the time on the road has been horrible for me after i hit rock bottom the last time i decided to stop it all

9391276 if youre good at dressing 7 to 14 year old girls it doesnt necessarily make you good at dressing teenage girl or a 25 year old
9391277 its tough to wait it out if youre not outperforming in this environment
9391278 theres no question abercrombie has figured out the teen segment pretty darn well
9391279 but theyve clearly missed on young adult segment with ruehl
9391280 its fair to say that well be watching the sales trend in ruehl very closely as we get to the end of the year and beginning of next year
9391281 so far im greatly encouraged but i recognize headwinds remain challenging
9391282 you have to give their management team a ton of credit for their discipline and focus
9391283 its tough to be in an early stage of growth in this environment its very touch and go

9391290 we were on a busy street that became silent the roads were flooded
9391291 i pray to god to help them and to protect them for me not only my country but other countries the storm hit
9391292 were coming back earlier because the hotel we were in actually closed and asked us to leave early so as a consequence we had to go
9391293 they lost everything the first time so they could possibly lose it again
9391294 in fact they just rebuilt they just moved back into their home about a year ago
9391295 one of the things i learned at the feet of the master norm maleng was this is a decision that uniquely rests with the elected prosecutor
9391296 its not the product of a committee vote and its not something we put on victim families to decide
9391297 the prosecutor has to act as a sponge to absorb all of this and come up with a result that is justifiable
9391298 this is about the overwhelming sense of remorse that i have for having let everyone down
9391299 can you as an advocate assist a person you believe to be mentally ill in state sponsored suicide
9391300 my opinion was i cant do that with a mentally ill person
9391301 when you get to the point when you have a conviction and a sentence imposed the interest of the state is in seeing an appropriate sentence carried out
9391302 its been happenstance that the people whove been executed in washington have been volunteers
9391303 there are several cases that are far along in the process and they are not volunteers
9391304 it robs the jury of the chance to determine whether or not in their minds as representatives of the people this person should be put to death
9391305 the death penalty was never intended to provide a defendant a way to commit suicide thats completely contrary to the purpose of the punishment
9391306 whats more important is looking at the strength of the evidence and to make sure you have moral certainty that you can prove the case
9391307 people with disabilities represent the largest minority group in the u s yet most members of this community feel that the issues of importance to them receive little attention from the presidential candidates and from the political system as a whole
9391308 disabooms polls show that this community is eager to be included in the political dialogue in the 2008 election
9391309 craig parrys no guts no glory workout changed my life
9391310 i wish to thank craig and his team for helping me maintain a weight that i have had since i was in high school i am now 30 and feel great i have kept my weight for over two weeks now craig has truly changed my life not only physically but mentally and i thank god for craig parry and the support he provides
9391311 canada and the united states have a long history of helping each other in times of need
9391312 we were pleased that we could provide this support so quickly
9391313 our highly trained medical team and this specially outfitted cc 177 have the ability to quickly and efficiently move those in need of medical assistance
9391314 our military support of civil emergency operations helps to save lives prevent human suffering and mitigate damage to property
9391315 i spoke with secretary chertoff this morning to discuss the situation
9391316 secretary chertoff expressed gratitude on behalf of the u s government for canadas help i offered any additional assistance they may require on the ground now or after gustav hits the gulf states including help from a heavy urban search and rescue team canada stands ready to help
9391317 we are going to march into the arms of police whatever they are going to do is all right with us
9391318 theres no chance she is going to come out of it all right
9391319 we are making sure that people here to legitimately protest have the right to do that but people engaging in criminal activity are not going to be able to do that
9391320 i think we have done absolutely everything we can to accommodate first amendment rights
9391321 but the weapons recovered as a result of these operations make it very clear that there are people here planning to engage in criminal behavior
9391322 together we can derail this purely ceremonial show of this repressive system and remake it with our own hands
9391323 the definition of insanity is to do the same thing the same way and expect a different result
9391324 weve been asking kids to go to school for 35 straight years
9391325 and they go to school but theyre missing an education because the schools that they go to dont have the resources to adequately educate them
9391326 we have college materials we have grammar school materials its going to set up like a montessori school were going to have school in the chase manhattan building and city hall and lasalle bank and all the places
9391327 i just believe if we make enough noise by friday there will be somebody saying heres the money go take care of your school
9391328 i dont want to send my kids to any second class school anymore
9391329 if i have to keep my kids out for a whole month im willing to do that
9391330 i think that if for nothing else people will finally be able to see that the funding disparities are real and that the achievement gaps are real
9391331 my daughter is in special education classes and she needs all the help she can get colleges look at that
9391332 the schools should get their money but it shouldnt be in the lap of the children
9391333 our children have to be in school they have to get an education
9391334 we have to continue to build a culture where education matters
9391335 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9391336 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9391337 we are working with the delegations financial people finance committees many other concerned individuals to do what we can to raise money for various charities that operate in the gulf coast region
9391338 im happy to report to you that the coordination and the work thats being done at all levels appears to be excellent
9391339 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans not as republicans
9391340 i thin sen obama if they want to do down that route in all candor she has far far more experience than sen obama does
9391341 was a community organizer when she was in elected office he was in the state senate and voted 130 times present he never took on his party on anything she took on a party and the old bulls and the old boy network and she succeeded
9391342 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9391343 im trying to get my family out of there and stay here for the week
9391344 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans not as republicans
9391345 were going to make sure that equal pay for equal work is a reality in this country
9391346 seems like a very engaging person nice person but ive got to say shes opposed like john mccain is to equal pay for equal work that doesnt make much sense to me
9391347 i am all in favor of pay equity for women but this kind of legislation opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
9391348 were going to invest 15 billion a year in making highly efficient cars of the future right here in ohio right here in america
9391349 windmills and solar panels and biofuels right here in ohio creating millions of jobs that cant be exported
9391350 she has experience not only in politics but in life
9391351 shes a mother of five children and she has more experience than barack obama
9391352 governor palin took on ted stevens if she can take him on she can take on the russians
9391353 palin is commander in chief of the alaskan national guard
9391354 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9391355 if they want to go down that route in all candor she has far more experience than senator obama does
9391356 there are a lot of other republican women who could have filled this role if that is what he was looking for
9391357 maybe its my own background as a mayor and united states attorney but this whole idea of executive experience to me would really qualify her
9391358 you know why she had to make decisions all sen obama has had to do is talk thats all he does
9391359 no doubt the campaign staff have her hooked up to a fire hose on foreign policy issues
9391360 no doubt they fear a debate with joe biden that touches foreign affairs
9391361 my guess is graham and joe lieberman are doing a lot of tutoring
9391362 the experience issue is on the other side the no 1 guy there is the guy without the experience
9391363 depor won and congratulations to them but we should have defended better for both of their goals
9391364 we were poor going forward and know we have to improve
9391365 with the quality we have in the team we are going to score goals
9391366 on a personal note it was a double boost as i made my debut and got a goal
9391367 we plan to be as flexible as possible and do what we can do
9391368 we have 45 000 people attending and most are already here maybe well have to make some adjustments
9391369 life is like this this is inevitably going to change the convention in some way we cant expect the convention to go ahead in a normal way
9391370 first things first we should focus on the needs of the emergency the convention hoopla will have to come second
9391371 the conventions message will get out im not going to worry the message wont get out
9391372 one of the mass shelters in alexandria louisiana has already exceeded its capacity
9391373 as the evacuation continues shelter officials are going to be challenged to meet the needs of children we hope to provide the support and assistance they need
9391374 we know from experience that their needs are often overlooked during the confusion before during and after a disaster save the children will be there to provide safe activities for children in shelters and to help them and their parents return to the normalcy once the danger has passed
9391375 not discussed in front of the 11 year old who might be reading this forum
9391376 we have shown that n 3 pufa treatment is effective and safe in a large population of patients with heart failure of any cause who are receiving standard clinical care provided in hospitals and ambulatory facilities in italy since we invited all cardiology centres operating in italy to participate in the trial and most did so the results indicate what is likely to happen in the real world during the course of several years of polypharmacy care
9391377 these latest findings represent an important step forward in the treatment of patients suffering from heart failure with two million new cases of chf diagnosed each year worldwide the incidence of heart failure is increasing and it is the most rapidly growing cardiovascular disorder in the us these results underline the potential of omacor in the treatment of life threatening cardiovascular diseases
9391378 when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him
9391379 i never noticed until you pointed that out to me
9391380 technically im not very good im an artist give me a tuba and ill get you something out of it
9391381 having them all back 100 percent is huge for our football team
9391382 our offense didnt give our defense much chance for a rest we couldnt establish any long drives because we werent running ball effectively a couple of times we were probably close
9391383 offensive line is a group where you really have to watch film to see where the breakdowns were and how they got better and if they got better in the second half
9391384 we would do something and then put the ball on the ground we would do something and one guy would have a missed assignment we had an exchange problem when you have that you cant get a rhythm
9391385 theres no chance she is going to come out of it all right
9391386 we were supposed to leave friday but they didnt let shuttles or anything go out thursday or friday
9391387 we were on a busy street that became silent the roads were flooded
9391388 i pray to god to help them and to protect them for me not only my country but other countries the storm hit
9391389 were coming back earlier because the hotel we were in actually closed and asked us to leave early so as a consequence we had to go
9391390 they lost everything the first time so they could possibly lose it again
9391391 in fact they just rebuilt they just moved back into their home about a year ago
9391392 the definition of insanity is to do the same thing the same way and expect a different result
9391393 weve been asking kids to go to school for 35 straight years
9391394 and they go to school but theyre missing an education because the schools that they go to dont have the resources to adequately educate them
9391395 we have college materials we have grammar school materials its going to set up like a montessori school were going to have school in the chase manhattan building and city hall and lasalle bank and all the places
9391396 i just believe if we make enough noise by friday there will be somebody saying heres the money go take care of your school
9391397 i dont want to send my kids to any second class school anymore
9391398 if i have to keep my kids out for a whole month im willing to do that
9391399 i think that if for nothing else people will finally be able to see that the funding disparities are real and that the achievement gaps are real
9391400 my daughter is in special education classes and she needs all the help she can get colleges look at that
9391401 the schools should get their money but it shouldnt be in the lap of the children
9391402 our children have to be in school they have to get an education
9391403 we have to continue to build a culture where education matters
9391404 it might be this existing invader is modifying the bottom environment
9391405 there is some variability but overall calcium levels seem relatively low
9391406 visually the clams and the algae are utilizing the same area of the lake
9391407 i dont think it will be overnight i think it will happen incrementally
9391408 our job until we leave whenever that is is to continue training the iraqi police training the iraqi army giving them advice and continuing to be a force for stability
9391409 there are things here that i can do without for sure things that we brought here in the bad old days that i simply dont need anymore
9391410 everyone here is working 15 to 20 hours a day
9391411 that is in the marine dna to be in a real fight but this is the toughest part of what we have been doing here putting the plug in the insurgency its very intellectual and requires a tremendous amount of patience
9391412 its taken a long time to get to this point and certainly mistakes were made on the ground in anbar
9391413 things were done that perhaps in retrospect alienated people and caused them to move against us
9391414 nn pentirti di ci k hai ftt se qnd lhai ftt eri felice
9391415 the forest fire that we have today was allowed to get out of control knowing the dangers of the fuel loading and the weather conditions dry hot windy
9391416 that is an extremely dangerous combination that i think should have sent red flags up the moment the fire started to the forest service if they disregarded those then the forest service bears complete responsibility for the fire getting out of control and now reaching its current size
9391417 we weighed the firefighter safety issues against the values that we were trying to protect and decided to take a less aggressive strategy to managing the fire
9391418 unfortunately we had several strong wind events that have pushed the fire beyond anything we predicted
9391419 firefighter safety is a huge concern when i look at deploying forces we have lost 19 firefighters in wildland fires across the country to date this season
9391420 the fire is playing its natural role in the wilderness
9391421 its better to let it burn this year under moderate fire conditions rather than another year under extreme fire conditions its cleaning up dead fuels in there that present a fire hazard
9391422 i made some decisions and well be taking a hard look at whether they were the best and most appropriate decisions
9391423 well be looking at where we might improve our management in the future
9391424 didnt change the governors viewpoint that the forest service as a policy matter ought to review how it handles wildland fires
9391425 we are guardedly optimistic that we have turned the corner with this fire
9391426 the day those tests came in we realized we had a serial killer on our hands who has been active for 23 years

9391438 ive been fortunate that the other projects i have been involved in i fully believe in so it is not like you are out on the road and you are phoning it in i really bring a part of what i do to the table and it makes it a hell of a lot more fulfilling then when you get back to your own project it only feeds it something like the clapton tour it was a great ability to get exposed to an audience that might take me twenty years to make happen it can be tough we have a band where the core has been together 14 or 15 years and when i run off and do other things it leaves many things in limbo i have been fortunate that everyone is continuing to think long term and not jump ship when they get sick of it at all
9391439 my people are fascinated with this thing ill get it for them

9391443 he was serious about his work and getting paid and he always tried to sing songs of consciousness there was always a message
9391444 there was an anger about him i figured that was his struggle coming up
9391445 personally i find them dull im sure its my loss
9391446 the arrest of a student and a staff member at nottingham university under the terrorism act in may

9391448 we should never overstate the menace we face from violent extremism
9391449 entirely acceptable and indeed necessary for academics to seek to understand and explain what motivates violent extremists
9391450 mi5 has concluded that there is no easy way to identify those who become involved in terrorism in britain
9391451 a unique insight into current thinking within the security service about how a modern day terrorist is made

9391508 our study confirms many changes seen in upper arctic ocean circulation in the 1990s were mostly decadal in nature rather than trends caused by global warming
9391509 the next cool period if the pattern holds began in 1996 with the effects to be felt starting in 2010 some predict three decades of severe cold

9391511 a peak in petroleum liquids production resulting solely from resource limitations is unlikely in the next 25 years
9391512 supplies from opec and non opec countries gas related liquids and unconventional resources are growing furthermore nations with the largest remaining resources produce under long term restraints not envisioned in hubberts method the ultimate peak in petroleum production may result from factors other than resource limitations
9391513 an analysis of resource assessments and production history suggests that neither assumption is necessarily valid
9391514 there appears to be a systematic bias that underestimates the size of the resource base by ignoring the future increase in recoverable volume
9391515 hubberts 1956 prediction turned out to be right lower 48 u s production peaked in 1970
9391516 a popular view has emerged that the world faces an imminent decline in global liquids production resulting from depletion of resources
9391517 the peak oil theory has raised questions about the future of the oil and gas industry how resources are estimated the current supply situation the role of technology and other factors in determining future supply
9391518 it does not follow that there is unlimited potential for production growth rather that the eventual peak in global production is likely to be much further in the future than is commonly suggested
9391519 it is possible that the peak when it occurs may result from a cause other than resource limitation e g government policies lack of access to existing resources competition from alternative energy sources improvements in energy efficiency
9391520 if it can be generalized this is an amazing conclusion it would imply that the sum of us measured warming over the last century could be almost 100 attributed to urban heat islands a different and more localized effect than co2 greenhouse gas warming nbsp perhaps more importantly outside of the us nearly all of the historical temperature measurement is in urban areas no one has 100 year temperature records for the chinese countryside however much this effect might be over stating us temperature increases it would probably be even more pronounced in measurements in other parts of the word
9391521 the fact is that the global temperature of 2007 is statistically the same as 2006 and every year since 2001
9391522 temperatures across the world are not increasing as they should according to the fundamental theory behind global warming the greenhouse effect something else is happening and it is vital that we find out what or else we may spend hundreds of billions of pounds needlessly
9391523 the rfp will go to the mortgage holder and using data on how much foreclosed homes sell for in that area offer the mortgage holder that amount of money
9391524 since the homes that were to be foreclosed will not go on the market they wont be exacerbating the excessive homes for sale problem
9391525 we cant afford much more there i think weve got pretty good depth still at both spots if youre thinking about trying to finish out the season but much more trouble there and we might really get thin
9391526 he played the most snaps of the interior linemen and had the most production geno didnt play as many snaps but was probably as productive per play
9391527 oh yeah i dont think there would be any question about that
9391528 he knows it could be a blessing in the long run if he rehabs well and gets maybe even in better condition than he was this year so hes looking at the bright side right now
9391529 offensively it will be good to have clint back in the lineup
9391530 i wasnt here in the past so i dont really know if he had a lack of dedication in the past
9391531 i mean i know what i read and i know what circulates in nfl circles
9391532 but when we sat down coming here we said were going to give this guy every benefit of the doubt and hes got to show us that he is dedicated and hes done everything that weve asked him to do and we feel very good about our decision to extend him
9391533 you guys see it out there we see it out there
9391534 hes done an excellent job in the weight room the meeting room hes come out there and hes jumped out at us on tape he looks good in the preseason so everything weve seen since we got here hes done everything weve asked him to do
9391535 to come back and clear my name is important to me
9391536 hes shown us that he can play so we didnt want him to make the free agent market
9391537 it goes without saying but john is an all time great safety one of the leagues classiest professionals and his elite play speaks for itself
9391538 as has been the case in other situations i would not rule anything out down the road
9391539 i have no regrets about my time thus far with the patriots
9391540 the immense respect that ive long held for the organization has been only heightened over the past couple of weeks i am going to keep all options open and look forward with excitement to see what the future brings
9391541 i said i am going to stay for the day i have a speech i was determined to give
9391542 things were already settling down when she talked to me
9391543 i dont think it was unreasonable for her to continue to travel back
9391544 i am not a glutton for pain and punishment i would have never wanted to travel had i been fully engaged in labor
9391545 my release for plainaudio is totally different from what ive released in the past experimental drum amp bass for me and drill amp bass for others was always my real passion
9391546 if i win a big tournament right away i have the invincibility factor again
9391547 i almost had it at wimbledon i would hope to go a step further and have that invincibility factor again
9391548 today was pretty breezy so i tried to keep the ball in the court not on the lines so much
9391549 i returned well i moved well on the baseline i served well and thats a good sign for the rest of the tournament
9391550 im playing well not wasting any energy and moving on but the important thing is winning the tourmnament i dont try to impress anybody in the early rounds
9391551 to put myself in that position is always a good feeling i feel like it could happen again here
9391552 ive never felt terrible i guess i always had a good spirit
9391553 i was working out hard in practice i was never really down you wonder what you want to do to change and i guess i never really felt that
9391554 its nice to beat him but he played really well in rome
9391555 im not top fit but i need to do everything to be top fit fight every point
9391556 im really happy to win three rounds in three sets
9391557 i put a lot of returns in play i was moving ok i served well
9391558 i can hit the ball more solid at times but i fought back really well now its a matter of geting back into match shape and getting ready for the fourth round
9391559 im going to have to hit the ball a little firmer at times i was leaving it short hopefully i can improve on that
9391560 a draw for me is a normal result because we had more chances but made mistakes in the final shot
9391561 i think we need to respect tottenham and the quality they have i dont think anyone in this room thinks that tottenham are nothing they put eight or nine players at the back and it is difficult to create
9391562 i told the players a draw is ok but we need to try to work the ball more if they make a mistake it is not a problem if we play high balls i win one time and lose eight
9391563 in the first half we were paying too much respect to our opponents maybe we were overawed by chelsea and the stadium in the second half that was a thing of the past and we managed to keep hold of the ball and our performance meant we deserved the point we got
9391564 its not likely that there will be any update until probably monday after some initial treatments and therapy
9391565 you see one of the guys go down and you hope hes all right
9391566 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9391567 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9391568 as i handed the ball back he didnt even grab the ball
9391569 i didnt know what to expect didnt know what he did he went down and he was in some serious pain
9391570 hes our guy it would hurt to not have him but weve got lots of guys behind him that can do well
9391571 it is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion however satisfying and reassuring
9391572 some guys that are hungry to win for the first time guys that havent won many times and im trying to do the same thing i just want to keep playing my type of golf hopefully i can hit it a little better and find a few more fairways
9391573 i have to go out there and play good golf
9391574 i have to go out there and just go around the golf course and win i think the guys that are leading are playing good golf
9391575 i thought a 66 or a 65 would be a great round
9391576 starting this year i decided to tell myself something similar to what vijay told himself last week that im a great putter and that im a lot better than people think and people write
9391577 so today was a good reflection and if you look at my putting stats for the year im one of the great putters on tour
9391578 its time to step it up and give a little kick on my butt and join them so ive been working on that
9391579 shrine board will get the exclusive use of the land and nothing has to be paid for that the core issue has been solved
9391580 land has been used by them in the past without there being any government order they can use it in future also without any government order we will not accept any government order
9391581 the state government shall set aside for the use by shri amarnathji shrine board exclusively the land in baltal and domail compartment no 63 s sindh forest division comprising an area of 800 kanals traditionally under use for the annual yatra purposes
9391582 the land was never taken away from the yatris yatra was going not about whether it was given for three months you have forced this decision at gunpoint made enemies of kashmir
9391583 it is historic day and victory day for us we have decided to celebrate august 31 as vijay diwas annually
9391584 theres nothing here we havent received any relief from the government there is nothing at home we havent eaten anything

9391850 the level of violence our members face at work is already unacceptable yet year on year the problem gets worse and it is time to put staff safety ahead of profits
9391851 no one should have to regard the fear of assault as part of the job no one should have to worry about reporting assaults for fear that they might be seen as the problem
9391852 staff who are attacked should be able to expect the best possible care and support but all too often the employers response falls woefully short
9391853 we need the transport police to have enough resources to respond in time every time but we also need the best possible legal protection that sends out the signal that transport workers are not there to be attacked

9391859 there was a problem with engine four and the pilot decided to come into frankfurt to repair the engine

9391862 we were told by qantas staff that wed be taken care of five hours later we were told absolutely nothing

9391912 the money thats been appropriated for the project it should remain available for a link an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done
9391913 this link is a commitment to help ketchikan expand its access to help this community prosper
9391914 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9391915 she was asked about the bridge and she supported it
9391916 how could she have foreseen that she would be at this point now everybody is surprised by this development
9391917 of course when you become governor things come into much sharper focus than when you are a candidate

9391920 la versione cinematografica di coraline molto fedele ai toni e allo spirito del libro nelladattamento abbiamo compiuto alcune modifiche alla storie e ai personaggi la prima cosa alla quale ho pensato era che non potevo deludere i lettori del libro e ho ponderato i dettagli da cambiare al meglio cos come lordine delle sequenze sento che ci riusciremo
9391921 e indubbio che ci siano delle somiglianze tra i due progetti molti di coloro che hanno lavorato sul progetto precedente sono nel gruppo di coraline ma siamo tutti cresciuti e la visione estetica attuale molto diversa vedrete una grande animazione come in nightmare ma come in un suo cugino anzi pi come un cugino di secondo grado lultima cosa che avrei voluto era uno effettuare uno strappo rispetto ai film che ho diretto in passato

9391926 brisbane has an 80 per cent occupancy rate which is high and we know due to the amount of business travel there is often so much demand during peak business weeks that hotels have to turn away guests
9391927 the reason we are doing this is because the availability of hotel rooms of a suitable quality plays an important role in the depth and diversity of the economic development of a city
9391928 mixed use seems to be the most common approach at present
9391929 if a developer has a choice between office and hotels at the moment theyre going to go office because of the return

9391932 do we have to shut down the boulevard every time somebody brings an event to town
9391933 is it that theres a bipartisan consensus that civil liberties are just for talk but when the handcuffs get slapped on people who have done nothing when people are punished for crimes they havent committed that its no big deal as long as they arent anyone important
9391934 so perhaps a major newspaper might act interested in mass violations of basic constitutional rights like the right to free speech the right to assembly and the right to be secure in ones own home and possessions and for the government to not be able to search and seize without a warrant they covered the exact same sort of harassment by the chinese government in beijing against activists and journalists but they dont cover it when its the us government wonder why
9391935 and perhaps the politicians who talk a good game on civil liberties might want to speak up so its not just blogs and indymedia who are noting these violations
9391936 perhaps but perhaps not perhaps in this case silence in the face of police abuses tells us what both journalists and politicians really think about constitutional rights and civil liberties

9391950 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9391951 we filled it up with 90 000 litres of boiling hot copper sulphate solution and then watched it go that was the simplicity of it
9391952 the operation involved officers at key transport hubs including the deployment of metal detecting arches and drug detecting dogs
9391953 our key aims were to disrupt criminal elements and deter disorder by targeting transport interchanges during the summer holidays and to create a safer environment for people travelling and working on the railways
9391954 i think you were right indicating the trailer was about tcw and not tfu because if you are going on cartoon network website they are announcing the biggest thing to ever come to television tonight at 8 pm i dont think it is tfu but tcw and i dont see why they will show a tfu trailer on cn the home for tcw series
9391955 its official the trailer will be a tcw series one it has been mentioned during the credits of the ben 10 alien force marathon going to be aired all afternoon on cn before the premiere of ben 10 alien x tonight
9391956 since the latest gambling legislation was introduced the industry in the uk has seen a dramatic rise in value and traffic online casinos based in the uk are performing well and the competition between them is hotting up resulting in better offers and sign up bonuses for customers
9391957 with broadband internet access becoming almost universally available over the last few years online gambling in the uk has enjoyed steady growth and we predict this will continue for the foreseeable future the only difficulty now for consumers lies in choosing the best online casinos and finding the best welcome bonuses available
9391958 were going to go with the biggest story of the day tomorrow
9391959 and right now the biggest story of the day is the storm
9391960 planned to join couric and several correspondents in the gulf region anchor emeritus tom brokaw will anchor the networks gop coverage new york capus said political considerations had nothing to do with that move will anchor from an outdoor studio in st paul and david gregory will report from the convention hall the weather channel all of the weather channels meteorologists and correspondents dispatched to cover the storm will appear on broadcast networks had set aside one hour in prime time monday through thursday for convention coverage its uncertain whether that hour will now be used to report on the hurricane or politics has done a good job at being sensitive to not wanting to throw a party at a time the gulf coast is under siege
9391961 were trying to approach the convention with the same degree of sensitivity
9391962 the message is anytime you do get behind the wheel you have a high probability of being stopped and arrested for dui
9391963 if youre going to go out and drink away from home have someone who can drive for you or make arrangements for a ride
9391964 the itunes business model works brings in money for us too but we lack price differential control apple wont let us we hate that
9391965 the purpose for the united states is to glorify god this nation is a christian nation
9391966 brisbane has an 80 per cent occupancy rate which is high and we know due to the amount of business travel there is often so much demand during peak business weeks that hotels have to turn away guests
9391967 the reason we are doing this is because the availability of hotel rooms of a suitable quality plays an important role in the depth and diversity of the economic development of a city
9391968 mixed use seems to be the most common approach at present
9391969 if a developer has a choice between office and hotels at the moment theyre going to go office because of the return
9391970 obama promised alternative energy etc in 10 years but he wont even be in office
9391971 obama promised alternative energy etc in 10 years but he wont even be in office
9391972 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9391973 to have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9391974 clicca per leggere scaricare tutto il testo di guglielmo pispisa pdf
9391975 the difference is fiordland is used to this much rain but new orleans aint
9391976 its breaking all records weve never seen a high this big over the country before
9391977 we havent got any explanation as to why this high pressure is so high
9391978 this is still a big ugly storm still strong and i encourage everyone to leave
9391979 i cant take a chance because so many people died in katrina
9391980 i was here for katrina and i was going to stay but this ones coming really bad and i decided to get out
9391981 the wind looks to be stronger this time im scared it will rip the roof off
9391982 it remains likely that gustav will prove to become a worse case scenario for the producing region and places the heart of the oil production region under a high risk of sustaining significant or major damage
9391983 in some cases we have become a bit more clever for example we have managed to set up the internet and have extended our knowledge of physics chemistry and biology but one thing has remained static we continue to deceive ourselves while manipulating and dominating others
9391984 it is all about individual honesty in my view this alone is the key to the true evolution of mankind and within the something wicked storyline it is the only thing that will save mankind from extinction on earth
9391985 all the material for the two albums was created at the same time giving the sound its strong continuity but during the course of the story the crucible of man something wicked part 2 gets focused and more compact
9391986 we are spiritual brothers with a long and meaningful relationship behind us
9391987 i never really thought it would turn out like this
9391988 i know i always had dreams of playing for the all blacks and i know i had dreams of playing at rugby park but never the two at the same time
9391989 on the back fields more they used to shut me off the no 1 ground but on a few of those back grounds was where i used to go to kick the ball around
9391990 our merger and acquisition team has been mandated to look for iron ore and coal assets both abroad and in india for acquisition
9391991 essar group is scouting for raw material assets in africa and south america
9391992 however it is not in the race to acquire united coal the us based firm that is now on the block
9391993 more than 800 000 people were affected by the disaster about 40 000 were evacuated to safe places
9391994 in addition around 180 000 houses were destroyed three large bridges in sichuans panzhihua city the epicenter of the quake were damaged cracks were found in three reservoirs
9391995 the fall in international prices is a relief but the companies are still losing money and we dont see a reduction in retail prices happening till they continue to suffer losses
9391996 we have set up a panel comprising of aai dgca and pawan hans officials to start identifying method for separate helicopter movement at delhi and mumbai airports and also an exclusive air corridor for them
9391997 it is very important to have a coordinated approach to improve the present civilian helicopter services and increase their number from the present 118 to 500 helicopters by 2015
9391998 for investors with a short term horizon of 1 2 months liquid funds would still be safe option while those with horizons of 3 month to 1 year may look at fixed maturity plans fmps
9391999 any fund with large equity exposure in this kind of market will not do well that is why we may see that star performers of 2 3 years have taken a significant hit currently there are no indicators that the equity markets will recuperate in the next few months with oil and inflation still at high levels
9392000 the establishment has its own sensitivities which we keep in view while taking decisions
9392001 unless the government allows global operators to first bid for 3g and find partners later our participation in an october auction is virtually ruled out
9392002 the fact that these companies command such high valuations even without startup spectrum infrastructure or customer base nine months down the road demonstrates the huge error in judgment made by the government
9392003 india does not need 14 operators the dot should have wooed a smaller number of new operators through an auction as in the case of 3g this would have offered an ideal combination of more and better quality competition large revenue receipts and quick network rollouts
9392004 consumers will bear the brunt of this expensive subsidy to the countrys richest companies by paying excessive taxes to fund the revenue deficit they also face an endless wait for service rollouts as the non availability of spectrum restricts any new gsm service offering for eight months or more
9392005 some of the bodies were missing a hand or a leg or half a head we recognized one of them only by the clothes she was wearing
9392006 i saw my mom my sisters and my brother and my grandfather were dead and our house was destroyed
9392007 during the russian invasion we havent heard of 10 members of one family being killed by russians in one incident but the americans did that
9392008 you cant be saying that the soviets were kinder to your people than the americans have been
9392009 we used to hate the russians much more than americans
9392010 but now when we see all this happening i am telling you russians behave much better than the americans
9392011 why are so many afghan civilians being killed by u s forces
9392012 the united states and the coalition forces are not doing that deliberately the united states is here to help the afghan people the afghan people understand that mistakes are made but five years on six years on definitely very clearly they cannot comprehend as to why there is still a need for air power
9392013 and i want to repeat that alternatives to the use of air force and i will speak for it again through your media
9392014 i have championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress
9392015 in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9392016 if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9392017 the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9392018 the money thats been appropriated for the project it should remain available for a link an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done
9392019 this link is a commitment to help ketchikan expand its access to help this community prosper
9392020 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9392021 she was asked about the bridge and she supported it
9392022 how could she have foreseen that she would be at this point now everybody is surprised by this development
9392023 never again never again will a disaster of this nature be handled in the disgraceful way it was handled
9392024 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans
9392025 everything they need from the federal government to prepare for what all anticipate will be a difficult situation
9392026 hello all this is a little story i came up from based on some actual insomnia induced hallucinations
9392027 you are such a cunt whats the masculine equivalent of a cunt oh yes russell crowe
9392028 working with barbara she taught me that there was no
9392029 i had to arse lick so much to get the right jobs that i used to put anusol on my lips
9392030 we had about 55 today for church there is a sense of relief that we will get minimal hurricane frce winds and only a 15 ft surge 1 2 of katrina but there is great sadness for new orleans i cried all the way home one of the parihsioners had come along i 10 and she said that all she could see for mile after mile were la plates i am reminded of jesus weeping over jerusalem and now i am crying again i have got to stop that as i need to go put baptismal records in plastic bags and feed the cats
9392031 youve got to be extremely happy any time you get a shutout no matter who it is
9392032 when you get out there you gotta make those plays
9392033 youve got to get the ball in the end zone
9392034 there is an increase in contractors devising schemes to hide the violations
9392035 weve heard about folks floating around china giving courses on how to beat the inspection programs
9392036 i loved coke i never did a lot just a bit at parties
9392037 but when they caught barbie i saw how my little sniff of cocaine had an absolute direct route to this f horrible man
9392038 dope always made me feel miserable and paranoid and unhappy
9392039 local students are academically outperforming their parents but what they dont have are adults to open doors for them because none of their relatives has business experience
9392040 the way californians order food at restaurants is about to change if signed by the governor more than 17 000 restaurant locations throughout california will be posting calorie information on menus and menu boards by jan 1 2011
9392041 i believe that sb 1420 is a bill the governor can sign
9392042 i am optimistic that all californians will soon benefit from reliable accessible nutrition information at the point of sale that will help them make more informed healthier choices

9392044 theres very little doubt we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action action to help our fellow citizens in this time of tragedy and disaster
9392045 i will not be going to minnesota for the republican national convention
9392046 i do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of our emergency personnel
9392047 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9392048 and i think for john mccain to want to find out whats going on is fine
9392049 the thing that i always am concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether were drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the secret service and various security requirements sometimes it pulls police fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job
9392050 im assuming that where he went that wasnt an issue
9392051 were going to try to stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then well probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible
9392052 seemed confident about having positioned for example buses on the ground ahead of time as opposed to waiting after the storm to try to get buses in
9392053 ce seront bien les revenus du capital qui seront concern s pas le capital lui m me
9392054 il est normal quil y ait un d bat et des interrogations jentends bien les remarques des uns et des autres jentends bien les r actions

9392057 im obsessive about a lot of aspects of the band i dont want to mess it all up
9392058 i have this routine now thats taught me how to control my breathing and its helped me not get so tense when im in the air
9392059 at my very worst i turned down a trip with u2 on their vertigo jet it was so bad i opted to stay in poland instead
9392060 the lack of control the doctor has been teaching me to consider the whole experience as an outsider like youre detached almost like youre actually watching yourself its been amazing and its really been helping me let go of not having any control thats the worst thing about it the short breaths come and youve lost control
9392061 i grew up being a fan of the great rocknroll bands
9392062 now we know something great is in our grasp and we want to get it right
9392063 im obsessive about a lot of aspects of the band ridiculous stuff really like t shirt designs and other little things i dont want to mess it all up
9392064 at the very beginning we just didnt have the time to even think about how we might be perceived
9392065 we wrote these songs and before we knew it we were signed and on the road we were so busy around the time of the first album 2004s hot fuss that someone just handed us a stack of pictures and we just picked one for the cover thats not really the right way to go about it
9392066 struggling with what im supposed to do and what im supposed to be
9392067 i think a lot of people in bands talk about liberal politics because theyre artists and theyre supposed to be on the left but ive spent a lot of time trying to work out who i am and i always come back to the middle i dont really want to talk about this i think acknowledging im different from people in most bands is enough of a statement in itself
9392068 i think the less time me and you spend together is for the better
9392069 you grow up as a music fan frothing at the mouth at the romance of it all over depeche mode pictures and bowie album sleeves and its hard not being able to control those things i mean the magazines wont let you pick the pictures they use some magazines wont review us live now because of it but its worth it to feel like i have some control
9392070 to be honest every time we make a record i just hope i can write another when you were young the bands 2006 mega hit does this record do that thats not for me to say but there are songs on there i do think are pretty special
9392071 im from las vegas i cant understand why more people dont wear sequins
9392072 your suit was the whitest thing since you know who
9392073 jeff is a combination of jimi hendrix eric clapton and stevie ray all in one beggars rogues amp thieves sounds like the lost eric clapton album these players are so good its almost too much although this is not a major label release it should be
9392074 flawless classic firm fat blues rock with roots funk and southern elements you can feel the joy jeff has in playing guitar inspired solos full of fire absolutely great it is a high level the band plays at
9392075 if you dont have to pick your jaw up off the floor when youre finished listening to this cd the first time then theres something wrong with you great stuff
9392076 from the opening jangly chords of beggars rogues amp thieves this album started to evoke the texas blues stylings of stevie ray vaughan thanks to a scratchy naked strat sound and then it veered into a whole other direction that of funky fried blues songs like beautiful day and free my soul take texas blues somewhere into the neighborhood of jeff beck and latter day rory gallagher territory with some fluid groovy extended soloing its those moments when the music really soars
9392077 scheetz uses his trademark killer vibrato and fleet fingers to deliver an enormous sound shock
9392078 a cross between jimi hendrix stevie ray vaughan and kings x
9392079 its a fine mix of blues rock roots southern and westcoast music filled with rich harmonies if you like govt mule the allman brothers the doobie brothers or stevie ray it s a must have for you
9392080 to all akashic fans we want to let you know that we are ending the
9392081 we had 10 fantastic years where we learned a lot with each other
9392082 we recorded two cds and a future dvd besides of playing two european
9392083 we thank the fans for all the support we will keep working with
9392084 keep following our careers and wait for the dvd which will be
9392085 i first heard chaoswave a few years ago while on tour with nevermore and absolutely loved that they had a heavy progressive metal sound combined with a male female vocal duo that sound huge and very unique together everyone in this band is a top notch musician i am very pleased to have been asked and contributed solos to the bands new album which i believe is sure to snap many ears in their direction this year
9392086 cosmic universal nikolo kotzevs rock opera nostradamus was recently nominated for the
9392087 the theme for this years award is musicals and musical drama from the nordic countries making nostradamus an obvious choice for nomination
9392088 it appears to be a party trick that has gone wrong
9392089 samoa will never turn down any game against the all blacks and its not the first time weve been in this position
9392090 we strive to play test rugby and it the all blacks match gives a number of guys a chance to do that we know its not going to be an even playing field but we just have to accept that
9392091 its a big ask for samoa to rely on their locals to fly the flag but it should help a number of guys learn what test rugby is about
9392092 its just a matter of finding some consistency every coach that coaches manu samoa seems to look to the uk for that consistency but if i was in charge id be looking at players in new zealand and australia and fill the other holes with players from europe
9392093 that way the team could train a lot more together were not like other teams we dont get a lot of time together and we need to change that
9392094 we have a daunting task ahead of us playing the all blacks is not something to be taken lightly
9392095 i think it is an important game for the all blacks between those two big test matches against south africa and australia
9392096 i think it is great the response from the public has been great
9392097 to be sold out in that period of time is great it reflects the interest shown by locals
9392098 one or two have little niggles and they want play
9392099 i thought perhaps the south africans were really pushed to the edge and australia may have been a bit complacent
9392100 force out is a sumo esque game where you need to get your opponent out of a ring rule the galaxy is a king of the hill game and force assassin is all about bot blasting
9392101 ill have a chance to visit with residents of both states who have been evacuated
9392102 several states including new mexico are preparing to and have accepted a lot of evacuees
9392103 there are millions of meal and millions of liters of water prestaged as well as a lot of blankets and cots
9392104 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9392105 because i do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of our emergency personnel
9392106 ive watched him under very adverse situations be as strong as steel in what he believes in holding up well and taking torture to not reveal things he believes in
9392107 she has experience not only in politics but in life
9392108 shes a mother of five children and she has more experience than
9392109 governor palin took on ted stevens if she can take him on she can take on the russians
9392110 palin is commander in chief of the alaskan national guard
9392111 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9392112 if they want to go down that route in all candor she has far more experience than does
9392113 there are a lot of other republican women who could have filled this role if that is what he was looking for
9392114 you know why she had to make decisions all sen obama has had to do is talk thats all he does
9392115 no doubt the campaign staff have her hooked up to a fire hose on
9392116 my guess is graham and joe lieberman are doing a lot of tutoring
9392117 the experience issue is on the other side the no 1 guy there is the guy without the experience
9392118 two people have been seriously injured the situation is more or less peaceful after the incident
9392119 we have nine such centres with food and other facilities where close to 10 000 victims of violence from both communities are now living
9392120 the mob torched my house after ordering my family to flee
9392121 let this madness stop im keen to return to my village and give life a fresh try
9392122 the conversions are conducted either through allurement force deception or all
9392123 para pekerja di hongkong sangat dilindungi hukum kita bisa melaporkan ke polisi andai diperlakukan semena mena sekecil apapun terangnya perempuan yang kini fasih berbahasa inggris dan canton ini juga menerangkan kemudahan yang diperoleh dari pemerintah setempat
9392124 of course this is a time when we have to do away with most of our party politics
9392125 we take off our republican hats and put on our american hats and say america were with you
9392126 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated in fact im very optimistic that we will see a degree of cooperation and effort on behalf of any victims of anyone whose lives are touched by this great
9392127 i think that with a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out what is going on is fine
9392128 were going to make sure that equal pay for equal work is a reality in this country
9392129 seems like a very engaging person nice person but ive got to say shes opposed like john mccain is to equal pay for equal work that doesnt make much sense to me
9392130 i am all in favor of pay equity for women but this kind of legislation opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
9392131 were going to invest 15 billion a year in making highly efficient cars of the future right here in ohio right here in america
9392132 windmills and solar panels and biofuels right here in ohio creating millions of jobs that cant be exported
9392133 we hypothesised that circulating concentrations of sex hormones were associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors in men long before any apparent manifestations of cardiovascular disease such as stroke or myocardial infarction
9392134 we examined associations of circulating estrogens estradiol and estrone as well as androgens testosterone and androstenedione with major cardiovascular risk factors lipids blood pressure body mass in 933 young median age 19 years apparently healthy men
9392135 our studies showed that one of the sex hormones estradiol was associated positively with total cholesterol and negatively with hdl cholesterol circulating concentrations of another sex hormone estrone showed strong positive associations with both total cholesterol and ldl cholesterol
9392136 thus men with the highest concentrations of estrone and estradiol may have the highest level of cardiovascular risk as their levels of detrimental ldl cholesterol are high whilst their cardio protective hdl cholesterol is low
9392137 most importantly the demonstrated associations between cholesterol and estrogens were independent of other sex hormones testosterone and androstenedione age body weight blood pressure and other potential confounding factors
9392138 our data suggest that higher levels of estrogens may have negative influence on lipid profile in men early in life before the apparent onset of cardiovascular disease
9392139 why natural endogenous estrogens that are generally seen as cardio protective in women increase cardiovascular risk in men remains to be elucidated
9392140 a number of other investigations on sex specific aspects of cardiovascular disease are in progress in our department and i am sure that we will be able to continue providing information in this area of research in the future
9392141 were excited about this and were actively moving forward toward clinical trials
9392142 thats just an example of the power of these microfluidics automation technologies that one or two people working together can actually screen very large numbers of compounds
9392143 big pharmaceutical companies have very large teams and a lot of infrastructure were trying to reinvent the whole process
9392144 clemizole does have the potential to be part of a cure because the idea is not to use it on its own but as a cocktail component
9392145 neither jeffs group nor mine could have done this on our own
9392146 it was enabled by both of us bringing our pieces to the table the questions he was asking and the technology we developed
9392147 we have never seen an ice sheet retreat significantly or even disappear before yet this may happen for the greenland ice sheet in the coming centuries to millennia
9392148 what we dont know is the rate of melting of the greenland ice sheet the geologic data we compiled on the retreat history of the laurentide ice sheet however gives us a window into how fast these large blocks of ice can melt and raise sea level
9392149 i was surprised to see that the model in agreement with anders data showed the laurentide ice sheet disappearing at 2 7 m year
9392150 this finding shows the potential for ice to disappear quickly given the right push
9392151 the word glacial used to imply that something was very slow
9392152 this new evidence compiled from the past paired with our model for predicting future climate indicates that glacial is anything but slow past ice sheets responded quickly to a changing climate hinting at the potential for a similar response in the future
9392153 carlson and colleagues show that the decay of the laurentide ice sheet in the early holocene was extremely fast during the periods they consider their work suggests that in principle future melt rates on the order of one metre per century are certainly not out of the question
9392154 were not talking about something catastrophic but we could see a much bigger response in terms of sea level from the greenland ice sheet over the next 100 years than what is currently predicted
9392155 weve never seen an ice sheet disappear before but here we have a record
9392156 for planning purposes we should see the ipcc projections as conservative
9392157 we think this is a very low estimate of what the greenland ice sheet will contribute to sea level
9392158 i know a lot of people on vacation dont want to hear that but we cant afford to have anyone injured in an incident like this
9392159 weve got to freeze everything at this point until we get our arms wrapped around this
9392160 the risks at this point we really dont know we have to find out whether or not the disease is in the free ranging deer around the facility
9392161 in order to figure out where we stand and where we go next we need animals to test and we need hunters to do that
9392162 an area can be contaminated with the prions and it can remain a source of infection for susceptible animals for a long period of time even years
9392163 this gene is crucial to the daisy chain of signals that run between body fat and the brain
9392164 it likely plays a pivotal role in how much we as humans eat and whether we have offspring
9392165 leptin tells the brain that times are good your body is full and that it is not necessary to eat more at the moment
9392166 controlling appetite and reproduction together provides a big evolutionary advantage
9392167 if there is no food the brain believes the body should not reproduce because without body fat a babys growth in the womb could be stunted and without food to replenish the bodys energy reserves there will be nothing to feed the offspring
9392168 leptin works remarkably well to give the brain a good indication of how much food has been eaten 99 9 percent of the time it balances food intake with energy use
9392169 the problem is that no machine works 100 percent of the time and that slight bit of inefficiency can lead to extra body weight
9392170 try to make a way to make sure the brain signals are being heard
9392171 their hormones and blood sugar resembled that seen in humans with these disorders
9392172 we dont study infertility but we put two and two together
9392173 we knew leptin is the critical hormone for regulating body weight and that it is also very important for regulating reproduction
9392174 this suggests that half of the dose of torc switch is enough to cause problems in leptin signaling in the brain and it may be that subtle mutations in torc1 in humans could be responsible for an inheritable risk factor for gaining weight
9392175 torc1 is regulated by phosphate handling enzymes called kinases and kinases often make for very good drug targets
9392176 as we continue to find genes that interact with each other and with environmental influences in this complex chronic disease we are building the foundation for personalized treatments tailored to a patients genetic profile
9392177 we will resequence the gene regions we have identified to pinpoint the causative mutations in these genes
9392178 we strongly suspect one gene will provide a compelling target for drug development given whats known about its biology
9392179 although the gene variants we found may have a stronger signal in pediatric ibd than in adult onset ibd we do not believe them to be limited to varieties of the disease that begin in childhood
9392180 as we better understand the complex gene interactions in ibd we may be able to diagnose patients by their genetic profile to predict who will better respond to anti tnf drugs
9392181 if better knowledge of the disease pathway enables pharmaceutical companies to develop anti tnf drugs in pill form the medications will be easier to deliver as well as more customized to each patient
9392182 telomerase is an ideal target for chemotherapy because it is active in almost all human tumors but inactive in most normal cells
9392183 that means a drug that deactivates telomerase would likely work against all cancers with few side effects
9392184 once we found that the gene from this organism expressed the protein in the quantities we needed we were able to move quickly
9392185 for the first time we can see how telomerase assembles at the end of chromosomes to initiate telomere replication
9392186 ive always been interested in understanding on a molecular level the function of protein nucleic acid assemblies and using that information in the treatment of human disease
9392187 telomerase because of its important role in cancer and aging was an obvious target for me
9392188 it required a lot of perseverance and effort but we really wanted to do this
9392189 runtime was requested by the application to terminate it in an unusual way
9392190 were here to clear the pr pollution that clouds the science of climate change
9392191 the heat and the distances between objects seem to drain the will to add words to whats already there
9392192 you can jump on it and jump off it its not a lifetime commitment its very useful
9392193 the main thing we learned from three years ago was the importance of staying in contact with each other
9392194 in my pocket 67 42 and my lucky scarab king cake baby
9392195 franck injey is an it architect with the international technical support organization poughkeepsie center
9392196 noshir dhondy is a senior engineer in the ibm systems and technology group in poughkeepsie ny with more than 35 years of experience at ibm
9392197 greg hutchison is a consulting it specialist in the united states advanced technical support organization who has worked for ibm for more than 25 years

9392199 george kozakos is a senior it specialist based in australia
9392200 iain neville is a certified consulting it specialist with ibm united kingdom
9392201 we really dont have the luxury of sort of trying to evaluate the politics of this kind of situation
9392202 i think we take it as it is and right now we have a horrible storm bearing down on the gulf people should be more concerned about that than a and i think thats the way were going to let the chips fall
9392203 hey just wanted to see how that new promotion is working for you
9392204 did you ever eat at that bistro 110 down near watertower
9392205 i was thinking about going to hawaii for a trip didnt you scuba there last year
9392206 it is good for allianz in the seven years they have owned dresdner they have learned that they dont have a clue about running a bank
9392207 but it is a huge integration we will see in half a year that something will go wrong
9392208 it was clear from the start to allianz that they did not want to keep the investment bank
9392209 but when the time was right to sell it at the top of the boom in late 2006 they fell asleep at the wheel
9392210 this could be potentially the most dangerous storm for the energy sector weve ever seen said chris jarvis senior analyst at caprock risk management in
9392211 the industry is much more prepared and taking things much more seriously thats why so much has been shut down so quickly
9392212 when people dont have much money they cut on big stuff and buy things that make their lives a little bit better like consumer electronics
9392213 the overall market in 2008 is not very good and europe is even worse
9392214 we are seeing people are more sensitive to promotional deals but have not seen signs of consumers turning to third tier brands
9392215 were not planning to subsidize this exchange rate swing at all well either find ways of reducing the costs still further or we may have to adjust prices upwards
9392216 clean and sober has a comfy bachelor pad goes to church and the y and darts around town on a mountain bike
9392217 i completely support modifying the schedule and agenda to be mindful of whats happening in the gulf
9392218 were just trying to adapt to get the country focused on what we can do to help the victims instead of focusing on politics
9392219 but were a very big country and we should be able to do more than one thing at a time
9392220 we would have had to leave anyway we might as well come up here
9392221 we take off our republican hats and put on our american hats
9392222 i have every expectation we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9392223 tomorrows program will be business only and will refrain from political rhetoric
9392224 i do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of our emergency personnel
9392225 i hope to be able to get to louisiana as soon as conditions permit
9392226 it will probably be more somber up here than it would have been obviously the purpose of our party here is less important than the safety of folks in the gulf coast
9392227 first things first and thats protecting the people of my state
9392228 we have to make sure the focus is on the south on gustav make sure that all of the resources are there and that anything that is done with regard to the convention doesnt take anything away from that
9392229 these essential tasks of a convention have to be performed
9392230 i wouldnt like to claim italian levels of civilisation for modern england
9392231 check out their whole podcasting section theres some really good stuff there
9392232 greylodge regularly posts links to cool arty stuff on youtube and elsewhere wow subscribe to their video linkdump rss feed
9392233 this is a very serious case of mistaken identity and one which has devastated ricki lee and jamie
9392234 they have spoken to aaron about it and he has apologised profusely for his regrettable actions but mostly they want to make it known that jamie has never been involved in any type of porn shoot
9392235 a bit of cocaine i loved coke i never did a lot just a little bit at parties
9392236 but what ended it for me was when they caught klaus barbie the butcher of lyon in the early 80s
9392237 he was hiding in south america and living off the proceeds of being a cocaine baron
9392238 and i read that in the paper and all the cards fell into place and i saw how my little sniff of cocaine at a party had an absolute direct route to this f ing horrible man in south america
9392239 and from that day i never touched cocaine again until that moment i had never grasped the full horrifying structure of what brings coke to our parties in britain
9392240 she is a remarkable person who has achieved an amazing thing with a life she neither chose for herself nor particularly wanted
9392241 she said hello its lovely to meet you and that was about it other than horsey chat
9392242 just talked about the sandwiches and the horses then the queen invited us all outside to watch the racing
9392243 i think it was just a gesture to say its ok were cool about the film and that was plenty enough for me
9392244 its such a tricky area isnt it especially if there is no violence i mean look at mike tyson i dont think he was a rapist
9392245 i was date raped yes a couple of times not with excessive violence or being hit but rather being locked in a room and made to have sex against my will
9392246 i dont think she can have that man into court under those circumstances
9392247 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9392248 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9392249 i was trying to get situated at home i was trying to get things so it would be halfway safe
9392250 youre torn do you leave it and worry about it or do you stay and worry about living
9392251 theres really no place to go all the hotels are booked up to little rock and beyond
9392252 if we flood again were goners i dont think were coming back
9392253 i think for people who havent left they really are die hards because theyre taking their lives in their hands
9392254 i cant see any reason why a person staring down the barrel of a category 3 or category 4 hurricane would want to see if they can try to outfox mother nature thats taking an awful risk with yourself and your family
9392255 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our backyard
9392256 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9392257 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9392258 i was trying to get situated at home i was trying to get things so it would be halfway safe
9392259 youre torn do you leave it and worry about it or do you stay and worry about living
9392260 theres really no place to go all the hotels are booked up to little rock and beyond
9392261 if we flood again were goners i dont think were coming back
9392262 i think for people who havent left they really are die hards because theyre taking their lives in their hands
9392263 i cant see any reason why a person staring down the barrel of a category 3 or category 4 hurricane would want to see if they can try to outfox mother nature thats taking an awful risk with yourself and your family
9392264 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our backyard
9392265 when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9392266 ahead of time i want to thank all my fellow republicans as we take off our republican hats and put on our american hats and we say america were with you
9392267 we are working with the delegations financial people finance committees many other concerned individuals to do what we can to raise money for various charities that operate in the gulf coast region
9392268 happy to report to you that the coordination and the work thats being done at all levels appears to be excellent
9392269 every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9392270 shes had 12 years of elected office experience including traveling to kuwait including being involved in these issues
9392271 im so proud that she has displayed the kind of judgment and she has the experience and judgment as an executive
9392272 remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9392273 i know you will never ever say nothing about what happened we swore it on the bible it cant matter now shes in heaven or to the ones here on earth i believe in your promise lisa
9392274 the water in the tea kettle was often frozen by morning
9392275 there are ghosts walking around inside me but they dont always talk sometimes they have nothing to say
9392276 dear lars i know you will never ever say nothing about what happened we swore it on the bible it cant matter now shes in heaven or to the ones here on earth i believe in your promise lisa
9392277 if not he would have destroyed it i showed you those journals with the pages torn out of them
9392278 that there were things pappa kept from mamma and us especially about his childhood he was fifteen then i think theyd already lost the forty acres of the farm and unless im wrong it was the year after grandpa found out his brother david was dead
9392279 it cant matter now shes in heaven or to the ones here on earth somebody died
9392280 a unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers
9392281 k v v e r nu blir det stora bokst ver sorg
9392282 och s river ett bittert taggtr ds skratt sig upp
9392283 we need a system of income tax reliefs to encourage donors to give art works to museums and galleries during their lifetime if you could cultivate relationships with donors while they are alive you could develop collections in a much more strategic way
9392284 there is an endemic resistance in the treasury to changes in the income tax system
9392285 there is a suspicion that it only benefits toffs there are now many people with a couple of nice pieces that they cannot afford to give away completely but would if they were incentivised to do so
9392286 america needs all of us to do what american have always done in times of disaster and challenge and that is join together and help our
9392287 reaching out our hands and our hearts and our wallets to the people who are under such great threat from this great
9392288 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention if necessary to act as americans not republicans because america needs us now no matter whether we are republican or democrat
9392289 we can activate an email list of a couple million people who want to give back
9392290 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9392291 stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then well probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible
9392292 we just hope that by the time this storm hits land that it has dissipated somewhat right now that doesnt appear to be the case
9392293 i hope and pray we will be able to resume some of our normal operations as quickly as possible
9392294 were going to suspend most of our activities tomorrow except for those absolutely necessary
9392295 i hope and pray we will be able to resume some of our normal operations as quickly as possible but some of that is frankly in the hands of god
9392296 take off our republican hats and put on our american hats and we say america were with you
9392297 we will refrain from any political rhetoric which would be traditional in an opening session
9392298 right now we have a horrible storm bearing down on the gulf people should be more concerned about that than a and that is the way we are going to let the chips fall
9392299 we can activate an email list of a couple million people who want to give back
9392300 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9392301 in light of these events i will not be going to minnesota for the
9392302 i will travel down to texas tomorrow to visit with the in austin
9392303 remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9392304 because i lived in indonesia i have more foreign experience
9392305 voting present rather than yes or no is common in illinois
9392306 i passed 26 of my own bills in one year
9392307 my campaign had nothing to do with the 1984 ad
9392308 i only found out about my investment conflicts via mail
9392309 you didnt want to offend muslims and others who dont like america
9392310 my wife didnt mean what she said about pride in country
9392311 the company does not believe in compromising food security by diverting edible crops towards industrial use
9392312 the company will therefore highlight the true environmental and economic benefits of biodiesel
9392313 for the first time in the uae a renewable fuel additive will be within the reach of the private sector allowing companies to operate in a more eco friendly and sustainable fashion
9392314 new and improved is it really hmm well im going out keys
9392315 what kinda cockamayme hmm could be lotsa tuna in it for me
9392316 ceos salaries and benefits are getting fatter and fatter while workers face soaring gas prices foreclosures and rising health care costs
9392317 the employee free choice act gives workers the freedom to form a union so they can earn better wages retirement security and health care coverage
9392318 i was playing great this is the biggest win for me
9392319 he is a very good player he serves very well
9392320 i fought a lot but nishikori played better than me
9392321 in these international agreements all our obligations for providing support will be set out economic social humanitarian military
9392322 the government in moscow deserves criticism for its behavior but that doesnt change the fact that security and stability in europe can only be achieved with and not against russia
9392323 thus europe would only be hurting itself if we were to get full of emotion and slam all the doors shut to the rooms that we will want to enter afterwards
9392324 we trust the wisdom and the courage of the european union to undertake the best available steps for that
9392325 i hope the initiative for an eastern partnership will gain new momentum now after the tragic events of recent weeks
9392326 pa kalau papa ada waktu papa baca keras keras ya pa supaya jessica bisa denger

9392328 papa baca keras keras ya pa supaya jessica bisa denger
9392329 it actually was its own sophisticated criminal little trojan thats independent of cws
9392330 it is possible that you will be looking after it for quite a few hours you need to make it stable and comfort it you need to know how to keep their blow holes clear and how to get them upright without injuring them
9392331 when i first came the hospital was run by mr donald king who was the superintendent and a surgeon since those times things have gone downhill because there are now more administrators than doctors
9392332 and they dont listen to what we say because they think they know better than us
9392333 taranaki has very intense sunlight and the wind makes it four times more damaging because it dries out the skin and makes it more vulnerable
9392334 something that grows that shouldnt be there needs to be diagnosed most i treat on the spot
9392335 my grandmother meta lived on the side of pukekura park and we visited her often every day we would trundle down to the beach in her morris minor for a swim
9392336 she used to take us down in the morrie in our pjs to see the lights in pukekura park each christmas
9392337 its these types of memories new zealanders all share but this life seems to be being left behind in a desire for more money and bigger tvs
9392338 this garden is about the simple life the things that really matter to me life is about time with those you love time to smell the flowers and time to grow your own veges
9392339 the park and the mountain havent changed anyone cool knows that new plymouth is cool
9392340 the view at sunset will be divine while this idea is simple the contrast between the wild ocean and the field of flowers will be stunning and the sentiment familiar and accessible to young and old
9392341 i love it it is so cool it would be definitely a great place to live
9392342 continually dwindling resources and a unit moving towards unsafe clinical practice
9392343 pub charity stuff has decreased quite substantially and more people are wanting a slice of a diminishing pie
9392344 people have to decide whether they fill their car up or pay the school donation
9392345 the overall amount of money has declined and in inflation adjusted terms it has declined significantly
9392346 my first reaction to this is i told you so
9392347 weve got less money and its going off in other directions
9392348 we add some numbers to our flock and when our flock goes to the freezing works we say 20 of those need to be allocated back to the school account
9392349 its another mechanism by which you can use the resources of your community
9392350 where does that leave us running fairs to pay for it
9392351 fundraising sometimes can be really hard and a lot of the parents just end up putting in extra money
9392352 just to put a different drive on the fundraising one of the mothers had access to make up brand mary kay and its been the best fundraiser weve ever had
9392353 we are going to march into the arms of police whatever they are going to do is all right with us
9392354 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9392355 theres a real possibility of flooding storm surge and high winds do not put yourself in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9392356 theres a lot of preparations that have gone in in anticipation of this storm
9392357 everything they need from the federal government to prepare for what all anticipate will be a difficult situation
9392358 theyve made it through great challenges in the past and theyre going to make it through this one
9392359 need to understand that in a storm of this size there is serious risk of significant flooding
9392360 i think we have plenty of opportunity to get people out in time its those who are choosing not to get out that concerns me
9392361 im glad that the people of louisiana took heed to the warning that they were given
9392362 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9392363 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9392364 ive been here since 8 30am its been totally quiet all morning
9392365 eminem performed on stage with elton john and all was forgiven
9392366 man went on the ru paul show so why are gays still bent on destroying reggae music
9392367 look at the reggae artists that they target they go after sizzla but they dont bother a sean paul or a damian marley when damian marley said funny man get drop like a bad habit what do they think a funnyman is a funnyman is a homosexual so are they afraid to challenge a marley or is he not black enough for the homosexual community to try and destroy
9392368 im truly honored to be joined by such an incredible team of all stars willing to go all out in the fight against muscular dystrophy the sheer weight of talent and professionalism these people bring to the show is sure to make this years telethon a smashing success
9392369 remain at sea at a safe distance away from the storm
9392370 that level of uncertainty is a bit unusual and indicates that earnings have higher risk in terms of the accuracy of forecasts
9392371 the results show that the companies have done a pretty good job of guiding the market in terms of profit expectations
9392372 but all of them without exception are finding operating conditions a big surprise
9392373 if anything the economy has run stronger for longer than expected as the reporting season progressed it seems to have got better
9392374 you cannot look broadly at the new zealand market now and say that overall conditions are tough out there and therefore companies are being impacted
9392375 the outlook was not robust but it certainly gave investors comfort that the company is in a good state to withstand the downturn in the domestic economy
9392376 thats why this years safety nz week is focusing on injury prevention at home
9392377 this years figures confirm that injuries in the home are much more prevalent and more serious than most new zealanders believe
9392378 we all need to take steps at home to keep ourselves and our families safe and not just for safety nz week but for every week of the year
9392379 increasing the number of rings on your home phone can reduce the risk of fall when rushing to pick up a ringing phone
9392380 its a joke it isnt a matter of holy or unholy all months are holy if they want to end fighting it should be permanent
9392381 we want enforcement of sharia laws and will continue our struggle we havent got instructions from our top leadership to stop fighting if they do order a halt then we certainly will
9392382 we are fighting this war this is our war there is no question of americas dictation
9392383 this is not a war but jihad and this is our faith that rewards for good deeds and that is multiplied during the holy month
9392384 funny how all men who wet daydream about dick extension cars are also convinced that these same cars have to have short stubby gearlevers for them to play with
9392385 this federal loan program program is not a bailout but an incentive for the auto industry and its suppliers its purpose is to get advanced technology vehicles on the road as quickly as possible in order to help the country meet its energy goals and thats exactly what were going to use it for
9392386 andrews going to take some time to reflect on whats happened
9392387 hes still committed to playing cricket at the highest level
9392388 how he goes about doing that and how it plays out i dont know whether it means india i dont know
9392389 hes had success there and is a very good player of spin and that is important
9392390 hes not going to be built up with pressure with the spinners where its dot ball after dot ball which is going to to be important when we get to india
9392391 hes an integral part of the team a great guy to have around
9392392 but we need him 100 per cent committed to the team and im hoping he can sort out any issues hes got going on in his head and we can have him back asap
9392393 we want to allow him to demonstrate he is committed to doing all those things you need to if youre to be part of the worlds best cricket team
9392394 hey look at me check out my totally awesome website
9392395 the democrats cant win the presidency without pennsylvanias electoral votes
9392396 the fact that all three sen bob casey rep patrick murphy and scranton native joe biden are white catholics with working class backgrounds
9392397 if the republicans win it then it is likely that ohio will also fall their way too and very likely indiana as well

9392404 by creating the frame of the last 25 years the idea was exactly to keep us from just rattling off chinatown long goodbye etc
9392405 that list has been done by sticking to the modern classics or whatever you want to call them we were trying to get at current representations of los angeles what the town is now the fact that say fast times or blade runner are forced off the list made us dig a little deeper and think a little harder i for one think thats a good thing

9392408 just when you think the battle of iraq war dramas has been fought and lost along comes one that demands to be seen if you can handle the raging adrenaline
9392409 the film follows the men of bravo company the elite u s army unit tasked with defusing bombs left on baghdad streets by increasingly violent and determined insurgents
9392410 the bomb removal boys have robots and shrapnel resistant suits at their disposal but they cant stop every blast as we see with
9392411 the job ultimately comes down to playing hunches keeping your cool and staying ever vigilant if the ied improvised explosive device doesnt get you the sniper hiding on a nearby rooftop just might if not on this street then the next one
9392412 gutsy and gung ho but new to bravo is a sergeant named james
9392413 testosterone flows non stop and so does blood but these macho men are just getting the job done in so doing they reveal much about themselves and also deliver some home truths about the iraqi quagmire this is no message movie yet

9392424 life loves to be taken by the lapel and told im with you kid lets go maya angelou
9392425 thomas jefferson once said we should never judge a president by his age only by his works and ever since he told me that i stopped worrying
9392426 after a certain point though mother natures going to have her say
9392427 hey everybody knew about the edwards affair it was in the enquirer so why didnt the msm pick up on it
9392428 smugness and rumormongering are going to disgust the middle grounders the people who are going to decide this election
9392429 what does this comparison imply about the capabilities of women
9392430 i say there are other ways to point that out that avoid any references to her being a woman
9392431 why would you use her pregnancy as a stat otherwise
9392432 somethings kind of changing here in alaska too for being such a red state on the presidential level
9392433 just another way of showing how inexperienced she is at her job
9392434 and how interesting that one poster made comment that because of that same babygate its quote
9392435 its like saying obama fathered a child and since hes a complete unknown that little bit of useless info will act as shorthand to get info across about him
9392436 and a scandal that even the msm is seen as pretty far fetched

9392440 alf yad sees tremendous potential in the renewable energy sector and embio is a partner that we are sure will successfully deliver the first of its kind production facility in the gcc in addition to commercial considerations embio represents the best and highest purpose for which alf yad was formed to assist the development of serious commercial ventures based here in the region ventures that will be capable of competing on a global scale founded by two young arab entrepreneurs who left their highly successful and well established professional careers to develop proprietary sustainability projects in the region we believe embio represents a real achievement in local sustainable development
9392441 we are confident in both the nature and timing of embio the need for a functional non fossil fuel alternative has now become more evident than ever generally speaking biodiesel is highly complimentary to a holistic sustainable energy strategy as it concentrates on displacing liquid petroleum fuels while other renewable energy sources such as solar and wind focus predominantly on power generation
9392442 here in the gcc as in the rest of the world we are faced with surging energy demand and growing pressure on the environment it was clear that the need for sustainable development is critical to a prosperous future for the uae and the region the majority of the infrastructure underlying the regions economic growth is diesel powered given the difficulty of making immediate major cuts to fuel subsidies the gcc states are rapidly exploring ways to make greater use of alternative energy to meet the growing domestic demand embio therefore presents a truly viable solution
9392443 we are very proud to partner with embio in this exceptional venture this is clearly one of the fastest growing alternative energy sectors and the united arab emirates is very well positioned to take advantage of this trend due to a number of local factors including strong economic growth large carbon footprint per capita increasing federal support and the recent introduction of several ambitious sustainability plans apart from its obvious potential as a high return investment we are convinced that this project has the added benefit of enormous social value for every citizen in the gcc which cannot be purely quantified in economic terms
9392444 we have changed the behaviour of 26 per cent that was quite encouraging
9392445 she was just completely rapt to be invited on to the show and shes having a great time
9392446 its an extraordinary opportunity for anyone involved in that programme its a massively high rating show
9392447 theyll constantly be doing press and sit ups theres a punchbag in the studio which they lay into and they hang from the rafters competing doing chin ups
9392448 the amount we got paid compared to the hours we actually put in rehearsing and performing meant we were on the minimum wage
9392449 the money was so bad we could have got almost the same at mcdonalds were the only people in the show who work 16 hours a day seven days a week
9392450 sometimes it feels like we dont have time to eat or sleep
9392451 we intend to build a new store at the placemakers location once we have access to the property and currently placemakers has two years of a lease to run our staff have been advised about this
9392452 yes the site has been sold to oyster management which we believe is a company linked to bunnings
9392453 we are planning to move to a new location at this stage we are looking at four possibilities and our preference would be for somewhere on waihi rd
9392454 we are very happy with our location and our level of trading in glover rd
9392455 theres a silver lining to the cloud of expensive fuel
9392456 the group expects to be able to advise the market of specifics in this regard by late september
9392457 zardari is a symbol of the national unity and the federation there are some forces inside and outside the country that want to cause harm to the country ppp will continue its fight against such forces and address peoples problems we want continuity of the coalition government in the punjab and at the federal level and call upon the pml n leadership to beware of those who want anarchy unrest and chaos in the country for their ulterior motives
9392458 looking for lying game playing crazed woman with no interests
9392459 the situation has not changed at all the negotiations are continuing and i still wish to leave madrid i want to play for chelsea
9392460 the president and pedja mijatovic said they will let me leave but schuster doesnt because he has promised to make me feel comfortable again if he thinks that its his problem i dont want to stay at real madrid
9392461 the behavior of chelsea officials who despite knowing perfectly well the decision not to sell the player have continued to make gestures and statements and have even sold the players shirt on its official web site all this has done nothing but aggravate the situation and confuse public opinion
9392462 there is nothing wrong with publicly confirming our interest in a player when the club involved is well aware of it has been in receipt of two bids and is negotiating to sell the player so we completely refute any criticism from real madrid
9392463 as for the issue regarding the web site real are well aware this was a regrettable accident by an external supplier which was rectified as soon as it was brought to our attention and not a single shirt was sold
9392464 calderon said that if a good offer came in they would let me go chelsea have made a great effort to sign me
9392465 my agent has gone a thousand times to talk to the club and the club has shown no interest in me staying now as the club hasnt signed anyone its in their interest for me to stay
9392466 ill recover because im young im not refusing to play i have a contract if they make me play i will although i wont be happy
9392467 he accomplished a no hitter and wasnt given what he deserved that should have been a no hitter
9392468 thats a stinking no hitter we all got cheated from i feel horrible for cc
9392469 thats a joke that wasnt even close whoever the scorekeeper was absolutely denied major league baseball a nice no hitter right there
9392470 they threw hit up on the board even before laroche hit the bag thats a play cc makes easily throws him out by 10 feet to me its a no brainer
9392471 the way the ball came off the bat it was spinning and it went to the left of the mound with a left handed pitcher going to get it its a difficult play
9392472 the definition requires standard effort and that would have taken more than an ordinary effort the runner was well down the line
9392473 the ball was still rolling and i probably should have picked it up with my glove we probably wouldnt be having this conversation
9392474 i think if i pick it up with my glove i get him
9392475 id like to think it was a hit from a selfish standpoint id like it to be a hit but you could make a case either way but im hitting 160 i need every hit i can get
9392476 hes been dominant since he came over and hopefully he and rest of the team will take us to the promised land
9392477 our hitters are really on right now and our pitchers are pitching as good as ever were really putting it together right now
9392478 we cant take anything for granted because the moment we do that everything blows up
9392479 i think if you take care of the seconds the minutes and hours will take care of themselves
9392480 not real pleased youve got to sit there and watch 180 pitches everyday id rather have the fastball thrown over the plate and have people hit it instead of giving runs away like that it will be addressed
9392481 to tie mickey mantle youre speechless what do you say
9392482 its really hard to talk about because when you throw mickey mantles name around thats probably one of the greatest home run hitters of all time
9392483 but i think hes worried more about us winning than his milestones
9392484 there wasnt one guy in here that didnt want him up at that point
9392485 im trying to get ahead with my fastball hes trying to hit a home run
9392486 im not going to change my game plan neither is he
9392487 then he got comfortable and started throwing that breaking ball
9392488 i think at some point it kind of sets in for everybody that theres been a lot of incredible baseball to come through this place
9392489 i couldnt get away with a monument so ill go with the dirt
9392490 babe ruth if i couldve got it in my bag but i dont think i couldve got away with it
9392491 i feel better than i have in past years at this point
9392492 weve had our backs up against the wall a lot lately and even more now
9392493 im not getting it done and thats all there is to it
9392494 this is the time when i should be winning ballgames im letting a team down big time its just frustrating im not doing my job i know how precious every win is right now
9392495 i just misread it got a bad jump and couldnt recover
9392496 im definitely very excited with the opportunity to go out there and make the postseason
9392497 you play this game to win a world championship so thats hopefully what well be able to try to accomplish
9392498 well just see hes going to play some second base for us and so will augie
9392499 like a lot of our other positions that are a little uncertain right now well match up and see whos playing well and try to run the best lineup out there that particular day
9392500 our scouts like his arm they said good fastball hes got pretty good strikeout numbers we drafted him out of high school so obviously we have a little bit of a history with him
9392501 we just feel fortunate that we were able to get a decent guy we liked
9392502 the thing about it is its where all that matters is whether you win or lose it doesnt matter the stats or anything like that at the end of the day the only thing that anybody cares about is if you got something in the w column or not
9392503 david eckstein is a very good player and a guy at this point that has a chance to fit an area that has changed a little bit based on orlando hudsons injury in that regard we thought it made sense
9392504 hes been a big part of two teams that won a world series at this stage hes still a plus on base guy he plays hard and hes been a part of winning teams and were glad to have him
9392505 its just that hes gone through this every year the last four or five years at a point in time where his arm feels a little bit heavy tired
9392506 i think everybody goes through that i think its a little bit of a dead arm period
9392507 he has felt a lot better the last couple of days as he sees everything coming back hell get better hell get on his stride
9392508 i just have to wait until my arm strength and power come back
9392509 not only me it happens to other pitchers especially when you are a power pitcher the most important thing and the thing to learn here is to know how to pitch with this i think this is the time when you have 170 innings close to 180 innings you have to do whatever it takes to rest your arm
9392510 three hulled wonder yacht designed to crush its competitors in the next americas cup
9392511 this is obviously the last thing we wanted but having said that i think these are really important issues
9392512 winning the americas cup in my view is not only about money and numbers
9392513 its like winning no matter what and that i cant respect

9392517 until i see that last day when weve won the division im not going to be relaxed
9392518 hopefully things can be different i dont think this team is giving you any hints of showing what happened last year its a different group
9392519 i had to battle a lot i was a little sluggish but managed to use my experience
9392520 he didnt have his greatest stuff but he pitched magnificently
9392521 i think we have a run in us where well win five six seven in a row
9392522 being my first year in the major leagues you couldnt ask for a more exciting team and situation to be put in
9392523 unfortunately we didnt score enough runs thats been out story the last month or so not scoring runs
9392524 we cannot worry about what happened last year because this is a new year for us
9392525 were playing good baseball right now hopefully we can continue that
9392526 wishing the americans would not fight people and countries unrelated to the terror attacks we are responding to
9392527 there is nothing good worth fighting for and there is nothing so evil worth fighting against
9392528 the time factor is important but we either have an agreement on all issues or no agreement
9392529 we at sasol accept that all art is ultimately about looking at naked women
9392530 there is nothing more natural than a nice big breast pinned up on a cubicle wall or in a workshop or slipped into your desk drawer
9392531 obviously talking about a picture of a breast and not a real breast
9392532 for most of our male employees the penis represents frustration disappointment and failure
9392533 and for our female employees it pretty much means the same
9392534 but if entrants are unsure perhaps a useful guideline might be to aim at the sort of thing that the members of our board have in their homes
9392535 and obviously lots of stuff by the doyen of bespoke domestic art carol boyes
9392536 tough megawoman who have own lash and who like to whip naughty naughty businessman
9392537 not only are we accepting new orleans residents evacuated on buses but we are also giving shelter to those people evacuating using their own transportation
9392538 we did what we did because it was a pretty easy call
9392539 he had a tremendous run out of turn 12 and helio crossed over almost the entire width of the track to impede the progress of the car behind him
9392540 i wasnt here in the past so i dont really know if he had a lack of dedication in the past
9392541 i mean i know what i read and i know what circulates in nfl circles
9392542 but when we sat down coming here we said were going to give this guy every benefit of the doubt and hes got to show us that he is dedicated and hes done everything that weve asked him to do and we feel very good about our decision to extend him
9392543 you guys see it out there we see it out there
9392544 hes done an excellent job in the weight room the meeting room hes come out there and hes jumped out at us on tape he looks good in the preseason so everything weve seen since we got here hes done everything weve asked him to do
9392545 to come back and clear my name is important to me
9392546 hes shown us that he can play so we didnt want him to make the free agent market
9392547 i guess its just nice to play well pretty simple
9392548 this is probably the most intimidating court in the world if youve never been on it before
9392549 my mom told me that i am losing a little bit of weight
9392550 im actually not losing weight im just getting firmer you know
9392551 it was one of my goals coming into this season next to trying to win wimbledon i missed that one oh well
9392552 its a goal but i want to win a grand slam
9392553 he accomplished a no hitter and wasnt given what he deserved that should have been a no hitter
9392554 thats a stinking no hitter we all got cheated from i feel horrible for cc
9392555 thats a joke that wasnt even close whoever the scorekeeper was absolutely denied major league baseball a nice no hitter right there
9392556 they threw hit up on the board even before laroche hit the bag thats a play cc makes easily throws him out by 10 feet to me its a no brainer
9392557 the way the ball came off the bat it was spinning and it went to the left of the mound with a left handed pitcher going to get it its a difficult play
9392558 the definition requires standard effort and that would have taken more than an ordinary effort the runner was well down the line
9392559 the ball was still rolling and i probably should have picked it up with my glove we probably wouldnt be having this conversation
9392560 i think if i pick it up with my glove i get him
9392561 id like to think it was a hit from a selfish standpoint id like it to be a hit but you could make a case either way but im hitting 160 i need every hit i can get
9392562 hes been dominant since he came over and hopefully he and rest of the team will take us to the promised land
9392563 its fun to watch him pitch unfortunately he was on the other side
9392564 i dont think it will be overnight i think it will happen incrementally
9392565 our job until we leave whenever that is is to continue training the iraqi police training the iraqi army giving them advice and continuing to be a force for stability
9392566 there are things here that i can do without for sure things that we brought here in the bad old days that i simply dont need anymore
9392567 everyone here is working 15 to 20 hours a day
9392568 that is in the marine dna to be in a real fight but this is the toughest part of what we have been doing here putting the plug in the insurgency its very intellectual and requires a tremendous amount of patience
9392569 its taken a long time to get to this point and certainly mistakes were made on the ground in anbar
9392570 things were done that perhaps in retrospect alienated people and caused them to move against us
9392571 i said i might just be writing my career off right now
9392572 ive had 17 great years and theres no guarantee what the future holds but you wont know unless you take that chance and i was thinking that
9392573 i think now that im here that part is over and done with
9392574 no one in that locker room is worried about it not once has a guy said hey sit down and tell me what happened they may want to know or whatever but were too busy and im having a blast
9392575 its been hard but really i know i made the right decision
9392576 everyday i would wake up and say boy id like to play at some point in the day id go ahh i dont know with each day that passed i got more and more committed to do it and that was all i was looking for from day 1
9392577 as time passed by i said you know ive still got the fire
9392578 i finally got to a point where i was committed and to me that includes everything
9392579 ive always considered myself the ultimate teammate regardless of how ive been portrayed this year
9392580 the day i told mccarthy i was going to retire he said are you sure
9392581 i said no im not sure but you want an answer and im giving you an answer im not sure
9392582 now i couldve told them all right ill come back even though at that time i didnt want to
9392583 and then july rolls around and we start camp and i go god i just aint got it and then just walk away well to me that was worse than saying guys if you want an answer right now im just not 100 committed and because of that im retiring i was just honest with them
9392584 i always liked ted and i dont want to say i dislike him now
9392585 what the hell am i going to do with a locker anyway
9392586 i started getting the impression in may that boy i feel like i need to play
9392587 the tough part was how do i get myself out of this jam
9392588 when he picked up the phone again after he dropped it he said oh god brett
9392589 he said brett playing here is not an option those were his exact exact words
9392590 theres no guarantees i come back and i play as well as i did last year but if youre a betting man and you said ok who gives us the best chance to win right now and this is not bragging but i would think i would
9392591 aaron may play great and then they all look like geniuses but to not welcome me back and im just assuming for fear of upsetting aaron not only now but in the future is totally ridiculous totally ridiculous
9392592 the next day i told him mike dont worry about coming down or dropping by
9392593 they made it sound like they had chartered a plane just to see me and i had made a call and said im coming back which is not true
9392594 mike called me on the phone and i couldnt get him to shut up
9392595 i didnt want to go anywhere including green bay and go through a bad season and lose and get beat up and everyone say what the hell did he come back for
9392596 now that could happen here it could happen in green bay and it could happen anywhere ive always felt like i give whatever team im on a good chance to win but theres way more to it than one guy
9392597 the bottom line was that i wanted to play and i felt like this team had a good chance to win it would be difficult as it would be anywhere but i felt like this would be a good fit for me
9392598 were going to go with the biggest story of the day tomorrow
9392599 and right now the biggest story of the day is the storm
9392600 planned to join couric and several correspondents in the gulf region anchor emeritus tom brokaw will anchor the networks gop coverage new york capus said political considerations had nothing to do with that move will anchor from an outdoor studio in st paul and david gregory will report from the convention hall the weather channel all of the weather channels meteorologists and correspondents dispatched to cover the storm will appear on broadcast networks had set aside one hour in prime time monday through thursday for convention coverage its uncertain whether that hour will now be used to report on the hurricane or politics has done a good job at being sensitive to not wanting to throw a party at a time the gulf coast is under siege
9392601 were trying to approach the convention with the same degree of sensitivity
9392602 of course this is a time when we have to do away with most of our party politics
9392603 we take off our republican hats and put on our american hats and say america were with you
9392604 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated in fact im very optimistic that we will see a degree of cooperation and effort on behalf of any victims of anyone whose lives are touched by this great
9392605 i think that with a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out what is going on is fine
9392606 after a certain point though mother natures going to have her say
9392607 when we take a hit like this it not only affects the growers but it can trickle through the entire sugar economy
9392608 one of the things we found out after katrina and rita was that the plants came back faster than the surrounding communities
9392609 where the workers are and getting them back is going to be tricky thing
9392610 its awful when youre in one but the fact is the u s economy is so big that these things just dont matter that much economically
9392611 katrina was a real mess and caused something like 25 billion in damage but if you lose 20 billion or 25 billion in the context of a 10 trillion economy its not really a very big deal
9392612 how many times are the other 49 states going to be willing
9392613 there was talk the first time around about whether it was worth it those kinds of comments might be better received this time
9392614 il me reste vous dire deux mots merci du fond du coeur pour avoir fait que le parti socialiste est l

9392630 were going to make sure that equal pay for equal work is a reality in this country
9392631 seems like a very engaging person nice person but ive got to say shes opposed like john mccain is to equal pay for equal work that doesnt make much sense to me
9392632 i am all in favor of pay equity for women but this kind of legislation opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems

9392655 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous theres a real possibility of flooding and high winds
9392656 therefore it is very important for you to follow the instructions and direction of state and local officials do not put yourself in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9392657 we dont want to get caught up in the katrina craziness
9392658 has prepositioned teams of search and rescue teams aircraft and commodities throughout the region
9392659 there are millions of meals and millions of liters of water prestaged as well as a lot of blankets and cots
9392660 he wants to do something service oriented if and when the storm hits and its as bad as its expected to be now
9392661 the present american policy with its attempt to push russia out is a danger to the whole world
9392662 if he steals my cow that is bad if i steal his cow that is good

9392669 oh no the evil murderers are coming lets run away
9392670 no lets film our escape then run away thus impeding our escape as we hold up the cameras
9392671 the way england capitulated yesterday it was as if they had given up
9392672 were aware of lamarrs situation and are disappointed any time one of our players is accused of wrongdoing
9392673 we take a strong stance against drinking and driving and will thoroughly investigate the situation
9392674 following the completion of the legal process we will do whats best for the university lamarr and the team one thing we have really prided ourselves on in our program is our family atmosphere and this will be handled within our family
9392675 its not likely that there will be any update until probably monday after some initial treatments and therapy
9392676 you see one of the guys go down and you hope hes all right
9392677 chris is a tough guy i hope its not serious you hate to see a guy of his caliber laying on the ground
9392678 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9392679 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two

9392682 hes our guy it would hurt to not have him but weve got lots of guys behind him that can do well
9392683 chris told me to just make sure to hold onto the ball
9392684 les deux entreprises michelin et honda ont parfaitement compris limportance du feeling entre un pilote et son mat riel en particuli rement les pneumatiques en d pit dun tr s bon d part pris par michelin et du fait que la marque est en t te du championnat du monde jusquen allemagne dani pedrosa a fait sentir michelin et honda quil n tait plus laise avec les pneus fournis par michelin par cons quent michelin et honda ont donc d cid de ne plus fournir pedrosa en gommes michelin pour le reste de la saison 2008
9392685 our medical staff was great enough to come in on a sunday and get it done so his probability of playing has increased for saturday
9392686 on peut en attribuer une moiti chacun mais je remarque que le jeune aurait pu laisser marquer le vieux
9392687 it was a celebrity fire in a celebrity place everyone knows about yellowstone and there was an impression that it was being allowed to burn to the ground
9392688 congress carved it out of territorial montana wyoming and idaho
9392689 so if you look at an 1872 map of the american west you see the rectangle of yellowstone national park and nothing else for hundreds of miles its the oldest entity in this region
9392690 no matter what we would have done the conditions were such that there were going to be great fires in yellowstone under any circumstances
9392691 they were started by lightning by outfitters by woodcutters we were a perfect setup to burn
9392692 fire is as important to the great lodgepole ecosystems of the northern rockies as sunshine and rain
9392693 so the forest recycled itself quickly now if you go to yellowstone youll see a carpet of green the forest is fully recovering and so we dont characterize the fire as causing damage to the park
9392694 i dont think it will be overnight i think it will happen incrementally
9392695 our job until we leave whenever that is is to continue training the iraqi police training the iraqi army giving them advice and continuing to be a force for stability
9392696 there are things here that i can do without for sure things that we brought here in the bad old days that i simply dont need anymore
9392697 everyone here is working 15 to 20 hours a day
9392698 that is in the marine dna to be in a real fight but this is the toughest part of what we have been doing here putting the plug in the insurgency its very intellectual and requires a tremendous amount of patience
9392699 its taken a long time to get to this point and certainly mistakes were made on the ground in anbar
9392700 things were done that perhaps in retrospect alienated people and caused them to move against us
9392701 the baltimore sun reports that security firm independent security evaluators has disclosed vulnerabilities in the popular mmorpgs age of conan and anarchy online the flaws which have since been patched allowed a malicious user to read files from and
9392702 i feel like im playing well and im looking forward to the challenge
9392703 my caddie and i did a good job in terms of the wind so im happy with the way i handled myself out there
9392704 ive always known that im a good player but ive always believed i can improve
9392705 goals of the 20 year plan wont materialize under the present policies unless executive officials really change their views
9392706 we see that assets are transferred from an open to a
9392707 we want an agreement to end the israeli occupation and establish an independent palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital
9392708 told olmert that we will not be part of an interim or shelf agreement
9392709 either we agree on all issues or no agreement at all
9392710 the most critical issue that threatens the whole peace process now
9392711 our forces are ready to take the security responsibility tomorrow monday
9392712 they are controlling the situation our troops are on alert to avert any failure of the transfer
9392713 we are happy that iraqi forces will be in control now of the security rather than the foreign troops that is how it should be iraqis should protect the iraqis
9392714 our forces are not ready to take responsibility for the situation i am sorry to say but there is lot of corruption in our security forces
9392715 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
9392716 oh my fucking god this guy is so goddamn cheap why cant i beat him ive tried him 50 times
9392717 moonshiners put more time energy thought and love into their cars than any racer ever will lose on the track and you go home lose with a load of whiskey and you go to jail
9392718 i didnt know what hit me suddenly blood was pouring from my chest
9392719 our productivity in clearing contaminated areas will be cut by 50 percent at the end of the month when the teams stop their work
9392720 and 2009 is a whole other story without funding we will have to stop all the teams
9392721 of course we are afraid to work and do our jobs but we have to we have to put food on the table
9392722 43 percent of the areas affected by the cluster bombs dropped during the july 2006 war have been cleared and the direct threat has been eliminated from 49 percent of the contaminated areas which means the surface bombs have been removed
9392723 aside from the cluster bombs we still have 300 000 landmines along the blue line the frontier with israel
9392724 many of the bombs were dropped on agricultural lands which means farmers are staying away from their land
9392725 we will continue to feel the effects of cluster bombs for another 100 or 200 years
9392726 this area was supposed to be clean but our neighbour was hurt just the other day when one blew up there are some areas where you cant even work the land
9392727 i saw one with a white string on it in the field and ran away i also saw one on the road when we first came back
9392728 this remains the main obstacle to the cluster bomb clearing effort
9392729 i was hurt from head to toe my stomach was literally blown open and i lost sight in my right eye
9392730 last night members of the st paul police department and the ramsey county sheriffs department handcuffed photographed and detained dozens of people meeting at a public venue to plan a demonstration charging them with no crime other than fire code violations and early this morning the sheriffs department sent teams of officers into at least four minneapolis area homes where suspected protesters were staying jane hamsher and i were at two of those homes this morning one which had just been raided and one which was in the process of being raided
9392731 then you agree with everything the government thinks oh and the church of scientology too
9392732 just 20 or 30 years ago demonstrations could get out of hand but i think that is part of free speech
9392733 how we get there the strategy 1 start strong throw all of our energy into the first day well kick this off right and stretch the militarized police state out so far that it can no longer contain and suppress our voices and desires 2 transportation troubles this includes blockades downtown at key intersections on bridges 10 bridges over the mississippi river in the metro area and other sporadic and strategic targets busses hotel and airport shuttles etc
9392734 they seized equipment which will now be checked for evidence of patent breaches
9392735 project a gets 15 million in additional funding if it builds the engines in backwater wy
9392736 what has nasa done lately oh just sink billions into that new rocket that is still in development and has another delay to 2018
9392737 well because of religious groups which uses politics as a tool to achieve their goals of blocking the research
9392738 american pharma company said that they could make 10 billion dollars on stem cell products from embryonic research
9392739 the idea here is that there should not be anything resembling a profit motive behind your choice of candidate
9392740 we cant afford much more weve got pretty good depth at both spots offensive and defensive tackle as far as finishing out the season but i dont think we can take much more
9392741 daddy i only cheer when all the people in blue do
9392742 je veux gagner un grand chelem en gagnant je retrouverai la place de n 1 mondiale et cest ce que je veux plus que tout
9392743 there is no official word that we have as a dealer regarding exactly what is going to happen weve heard different things but nothing concrete however we are very confident that well have retail units in 2010
9392744 so many people have expressed a sincere interest in getting the car
9392745 it makes sense that people should get in line now in order to have a shot of even taking delivery in the first year that the vehicle is available
9392746 i can tell you for sure there will be an announcement on september the 3rd i swear but cant tell you more nda something big
9392747 we are thrilled david embodies success and confidence along with a great sense of style communicating the ideal image for the johnston amp murphy brands
9392748 we got the call from corporate this morning to take him down
9392749 yak n tarihteki en deneyimsiz ba kan yard mc s aday
9392750 obaman n bile k demli devlet adam gibi g r nd n
9392751 this hospital was a collection of maybe 70 buildings built in 1910 it was a city for the insane called overbrook its now down to five buildings and they were all abandoned
9392752 we had these very tough guy cops who were there training police dogs while we were shooting and they were so matter of fact that there were two ghosts in two different buildings one was kind of a sexy turn of the century florence nightingale nurse ghost but the other wasnt so friendly
9392753 building five had this unspeakable satanic dark energy the crew member who walked into that building and had this experience with a ghost was not even capable of speaking about it still isnt
9392754 in into temptation i play like a suicidal prostitute it was filmed in minneapolis which is beautiful but it was bad weather i was depressed it was easy to play
9392755 ill say i wasnt there its one of the olsens twins
9392756 i decided to wait until it came out to tell them and that was probably my mistake my mom called me and she was crying and she said yknow i cant go to 7 eleven convenience store or church ever again it was so cute i didnt do it nude or anything
9392757 i have a nephew thats 16 and i just think hes gonna see whatever it is i do i dont see anything wrong with doing a swimsuit shot or anything but beyond that
9392758 she did all these amazing portraits of my kids and my grandfather and shes redoing all my tattoos shes such a f kin talent its cool to have her working on me plus its such a bonding experience for us
9392759 ill just look like an old wrinkled wet soggy comic
9392760 now you dont need to travel to italy to find a fabulous deal on italian leather shoes
9392761 our buyers travel the world sourcing a wide range of fashion forward designer merchandise including footwear for exceptional value
9392762 there was also a broken bloodsmeared bottle of vodka on the floor i couldnt get any sense out of john but then i saw where all the blood was coming from the soft underside of his foot was covered in a mass of cuts which seemed to have shards of glass sticking out of them
9392763 i kept thinking f k please dont let him bleed to death
9392764 the incident was down played in the media but johns foot was a real mess and i think he needed 42 stitches believe me this was not a minor incident taking cocaine getting drunk and dancing on vodka bottles is not a good combination
9392765 i knew john would be lucky to walk any time soon let alone run up and down on stage and we were due to perform the next day
9392766 forty minutes later john was back in his room when i replay it in my mind its like watching a quentin tarantino movie
9392767 na viva pi ata trouble in paradise voor de xbox 360 en viva pi ata pocket paradise voor de nintendo ds laten we de viva pi ata serie even rusten zodat we iets nieuws kunnen maken
9392768 in deze industrie kunnen dingen snel veranderen het kan dus zijn dat we er volgende week compleet anders tegenaan kijken
9392769 behalve viva pi ata voor de ds en de xbox 360 die beide komende week uit moeten komen heeft rare ook nog banjo kazooie boutjes amp moertjes in ontwikkeling
9392770 i had a grey tuxedo and the insurance company wouldnt let me wear it because apparently the material was flammable
9392771 they thought that i was going to spontaneously burst into flames when i was riding the harley down the road so my tuxedo idea almost went out the window
9392772 but then the wardrobe people made me one thats not really tuxedo material just black cloth thats not flammable it looks great in the film
9392773 every problem the blacks have the latinos have theres two systems of health care the one for the rich thats really good then theres the one for the inner city where they leave ladies in the emergency room unattended for 24 hours until they drop dead
9392774 people dont even check on her hours after shes dead this is normal stuff this is whats happening in the u s
9392775 i love what barack is doing with the heath care system once he gets universal health care for everybody then we gotta step up our system to make it the best in the world
9392776 theyre very sexy dresses full length frocks and bold colours stuff that makes women feel good
9392777 im just showing it to a collection of magazine journalists and boutique retailers because i want to start off small and see what the reaction is i really hope people will like it
9392778 i couldnt get enough sleep and sometimes onstage i could taste blood every now and then
9392779 they producers would send me to the hospitals and they would say well shes dehydrated thats whats making her tired they would put ivs in me but it just wasnt enough
9392780 i went into surgery and he doctor came out and told my mother it was a tumour
9392781 it really hurt my feelings i told my manager please somebody protect me because ive never missed a show i like to perform
9392782 i felt like after i had my surgery nobody knew about it the color purple didnt know about it my record company didnt know about it and i was very hurt that i wasnt receiving any flowers any balloons
9392783 when youre 29 and someones 19 its a big difference but when youre 44 and somebody is 31 32 its not that big of a difference
9392784 were going to go with the biggest story of the day tomorrow
9392785 and right now the biggest story of the day is the storm
9392786 maybe we creators of it need to be more entrepreneurial maybe we need to take more advantage of the online world of amazons kindle of self publishing of audio of doing live readings
9392787 we felt like we were giving more than we were receiving
9392788 we cant wait to play under the gg name and hopefully carry on the same success we have been having
9392789 i always looked at senator mccain just as a joe blow public member looking from the outside in
9392790 hes been buttin heads with republicans for years and thats a healthy place to be
9392791 im a mom and my son is going to get deployed in september and we better have a real clear plan for this war and it better not have to do with oil and dependence on foreign energy
9392792 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
9392793 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
9392794 so iraqi officials will resort to using the dates mentioned in the agreement to sell it to the public even though they might be intended to be used in a guidance way
9392795 bidens elder son beau had been a partner in the wilmington law firm of bifferato gentilotti biden amp balick llc until he was elected delaware attorney general in 2006 beau is a captain in the delaware army national guard where he serves in the judge advocate generals jag corps he is set to be deployed to iraq in october 2008
9392796 they have been told to be ready to cut off supplies as soon as monday
9392797 but it turns out that the women in america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9392798 mit dieser xml datei sind anscheinend keine style informationen verkn pft
9392799 do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9392800 of course were not going to have a big party or festival here if there are problems of concern facing the gulf coast
9392801 they cant afford to boot two in a row so theyll have to manage their attention on the hurricane
9392802 express their sympathy for the people who are down and let them know that their thoughts are with them but theyve got to get on with the business of the convention
9392803 we are going to march into the arms of police whatever they are going to do is all right with us
9392804 we both planned to do this if we could make it this far
9392805 we want to make it very clear we are pro soldier and anti war
9392806 i can lock up my house and scream about it or i can come here
9392807 its pretty clear that the point is to get organizers out of the picture
9392808 weve heard a lot of talk about how st paul should be hospitable to the republicans who are coming to town for the convention even though we in st paul may strenuously disagree with their views and civility is always a good virtue to follow but the real test of our city is whether we have the courage to allow those who wish to engage in demonstrations or nonviolent protest theability to do so even if those individuals have every intention of getting arrested and or trying to disrupt a political convention democracy is a messy business but if were prepared to tolerate the kind of tactics employed by one of our police agencies then we do a disservice to everyone
9392809 i felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every panda that wouldnt screw to save its species
9392810 you hear all the horror stories from that year but when you think about it it was really something special we went through
9392811 it wasnt anything we signed up for but to be a member of that team im proud of that and the way we hung together i feel like this team can handle the exact same things and be successful
9392812 for a little town to have a parade that big was amazing
9392813 i thought there would be a few people but the parade was amazing and this tops it all
9392814 thanks to our world class human relations practices we are not only able to retain but also attract our valued staff
9392815 we have forged an ongoing working relationship with heavens nest a halfway house for children who have been abused abandoned or affected by hiv aids
9392816 we have assisted with the upgrading of the home in ottery cape town and the provision of their daily milk requirements in port elizabeth we are about to start a similar relationship with quest school for autistic children
9392817 we are closely involved in a number of exciting educational initiatives including the go for gold project which targets disadvantaged students from local communities in cape town and assists with the provision of life skills mathematics training and work opportunities in the construction industry
9392818 we are also involved with the further education and training fet college initiative which provides support bursaries and in service training and work opportunities for northlink college in cape town
9392819 future growth in the industry will be driven mainly by infrastructure work such as schools hospitals rail roads and prisons as well as the major projects eskom will be undertaking
9392820 i guess its just nice to play well pretty simple
9392821 this is probably the most intimidating court in the world if youve never been on it before
9392822 my mom told me that i am losing a little bit of weight
9392823 im actually not losing weight im just getting firmer you know
9392824 it was one of my goals coming into this season next to trying to win wimbledon i missed that one oh well
9392825 its a goal but i want to win a grand slam
9392826 every man for himself and let every one else be damned

9392862 s var det alts ikke sant likevel politimennene l ste ikke rushdie inne i et skap fordi han var for plagsom rushdie var ikke uhygienisk i den aktuelle perioden og han var aldri suicidal og trengte heller ikke oppsyn av en psykiater
9392863 modernizing the electric infrastructure is an urgent national problem and one we all share
9392864 had we seen her when did we last see her
9392865 bringing a new face to an old party and renewing our partys strength if you dont keep a party young you cant keep a party strong
9392866 i didnt know what hit me suddenly blood was pouring from my chest
9392867 our productivity in clearing contaminated areas will be cut by 50 percent at the end of the month when the teams stop their work
9392868 and 2009 is a whole other story without funding we will have to stop all the teams
9392869 of course we are afraid to work and do our jobs but we have to we have to put food on the table
9392870 43 percent of the areas affected by the cluster bombs dropped during the july 2006 war have been cleared and the direct threat has been eliminated from 49 percent of the contaminated areas which means the surface bombs have been removed
9392871 aside from the cluster bombs we still have 300 000 landmines along the blue line the frontier with israel
9392872 many of the bombs were dropped on agricultural lands which means farmers are staying away from their land
9392873 we will continue to feel the effects of cluster bombs for another 100 or 200 years
9392874 this area was supposed to be clean but our neighbour was hurt just the other day when one blew up there are some areas where you cant even work the land
9392875 i saw one with a white string on it in the field and ran away i also saw one on the road when we first came back
9392876 the united nations has repeatedly requested cluster bomb data from israel including maps and the type of ordnance dropped but in two years plus we still havent received the requested data
9392877 this remains the main obstacle to the cluster bomb clearing effort
9392878 i was hurt from head to toe my stomach was literally blown open and i lost sight in my right eye
9392879 now they are stopping the demining but we are still dying
9392880 we used to cut down many trees for agricultural use which brought us a lot of hardship including windstorms decreased rainfall and increased solar intensity
9392881 the amount of rainfall has dramatically increased in the last five years and heat from the sun has reduced and we now have better yield
9392882 serious concern for future economic development and sustained rural livelihoods
9392883 we were doing everything by ourselves but we realised that we were not achieving much and we now involve local communities around the forests without whose help we would fail in our conservation efforts
9392884 kakum is one of the last vestiges of the upper guinea forest and one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world
9392885 the government now devolves more power to the forest communities in conserving the forests and shares the revenues coming from the forests and the results are quite remarkable
9392886 despite the delay in receiving the ecotourism royalty we are willing to continue with the conservation project and we want the government to bring more of the seedlings it promised us to plant because we have seen the benefits we can derive from them
9392887 huge strides and with much more growth potential to come
9392888 we democrates have been blessed by katrina now every time a huricane flattens a gulf city everyone will be reminded on the republican bush administrations colossal failure
9392889 the damage wrought by the hurricane may not entirely be the result of an act of nature
9392890 i have my laptop down there and i kept looking at the weather radar
9392891 i knew it was going to be a while ive become a pretty good weatherman after 32 years of coaching
9392892 im just for getting the calls right its nothing against the umpires or trying to take away the human element of the game im for getting the call right because theres so much at stake lets not have something happen at a very pivotal moment that changes the course of history for a particular franchise
9392893 this is most limited i know theres been some concern that if you start here who knows what this could lead to not as long as im the commissioner
9392894 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
9392895 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
9392896 if the ftc is successful in silencing daniel chapter one individual consumers seeking to improve their health and the health of american society as a whole will suffer important losses
9392897 we reported in the journal diabetes care in june 2007 that thiazolidinediones doubled the risk of congestive heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes
9392898 the increased heart failure appears to be a class effect
9392899 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
9392900 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
9392901 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
9392902 a 25 year health campaign was misplaced outside the continent of africa
9392903 but the disease still kills more than all wars and conflicts
9392904 any revision of the threat was liable to be seized on by those who rejected hiv as the cause of the disease
9392905 if you are a person diagnosed as seropositive hiv positive and live a normal life without taking antiretrovirals you can help me with a book that i am writing a book that will feature the testimonies of those who have survived this diagnosis this book will be in support of and will be of great help to those who suffer the social calvary of seropositivity and aids history will recognize the courage and bravery of each witness and your testimony will support and bring hope to those affected demonstrating that it is possible to escape the incorrect forecasts of the official view on aids
9392906 we are getting such poor information from the plant its worthless
9392907 i championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9392908 people across the nation struggle with the idea of building a bridge because theyve been under these misperceptions about the bridge and the purpose said palin who described the link as the ketchikan areas potential for expansion and growth palin said alaskas congressional delegation worked hard to obtain funding for the bridge and that she would not stand in the way of the progress toward that bridge 8 8 06 we need to come to the defense of southeast alaska when proposals are on the table like the bridge and not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something thats so negative palin said
9392909 thats a guy who actually stalks me on the web and once stalked me personally
9392910 no person in the united states shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance
9392911 sarah how a hockey mom turned alaskas political establishment upside down
9392912 well i really want people to say yeah the risk was worth it in giving an outsider a shot
9392913 the recently elected governor of alaska is 44 the mother of five and a former state champ in high school basketball she is truly mediagenic strongly pro life and full of spunk but can mccain say obama lacks experience but that sarah palin is ready to be a heartbeat away can he turn over dick cheneys office to someone whose only previous office was mayor of wasilla
9392914 the kind of a disadvantage of being an outsider is you dont know all the players the advantages are you get to start fresh you get to start with ideals and its worth it
9392915 dont think you need government to take care of all needs and to make your decisions for you
9392916 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9392917 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9392918 i was trying to get situated at home i was trying to get things so it would be halfway safe
9392919 youre torn do you leave it and worry about it or do you stay and worry about living
9392920 theres really no place to go all the hotels are booked up to little rock and beyond
9392921 if we flood again were goners i dont think were coming back
9392922 i think for people who havent left they really are die hards because theyre taking their lives in their hands
9392923 i cant see any reason why a person staring down the barrel of a category 3 or category 4 hurricane would want to see if they can try to outfox mother nature thats taking an awful risk with yourself and your family
9392924 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our backyard
9392925 when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9392926 ahead of time i want to thank all my fellow republicans as we take off our republican hats and put on our american hats and we say america were with you
9392927 we are working with the delegations financial people finance committees many other concerned individuals to do what we can to raise money for various charities that operate in the gulf coast region
9392928 happy to report to you that the coordination and the work thats being done at all levels appears to be excellent
9392929 every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9392930 shes had 12 years of elected office experience including traveling to kuwait including being involved in these issues
9392931 im so proud that she has displayed the kind of judgment and she has the experience and judgment as an executive
9392932 remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9392933 when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9392934 ahead of time i want to thank all my fellow republicans as we take off our republican hats and put on our american hats and we say america were with you
9392935 we are working with the delegations financial people finance committees many other concerned individuals to do what we can to raise money for various charities that operate in the gulf coast region
9392936 happy to report to you that the coordination and the work thats being done at all levels appears to be excellent
9392937 every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9392938 shes had 12 years of elected office experience including traveling to kuwait including being involved in these issues
9392939 im so proud that she has displayed the kind of judgment and she has the experience and judgment as an executive
9392940 remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9392941 we understand the politics of compromise and that senator obama has to be the president of everyone not just the president of youth
9392942 but we picked him because we didnt want the same kind of politics thats what set him apart
9392943 hes going to have to master the art of being able to keep individuals motivated
9392944 so that they dont feel heartbroken because something they were told during the primary phase is something that hes going to have to take a different position on in the general election
9392945 i understand why he needs to do it i dont agree with it but im still with him 100 percent
9392946 a 15th century painting is the deposit of a social relationship
9392947 he provided the tools we needed to take works of art out of the frame and off the pedestal to see how they really worked
9392948 he made it possible to see through the art how societies organized themselves and conversely how individuals perceived their own experiences and inner lives
9392949 seeing these designs one wonders why office workers have put up with their incompatible unproductive uncomfortable environment for so long
9392950 although nelson was one of the most important american designers and design writers its almost as if we are introducing him in europe and reintroducing him in the u s
9392951 most people even those interested in design may not know much more about him than a few design classics
9392952 deforestation has to fall more and the conditions for sustainable development have to improve
9392953 we feel that the union has had its day frankly
9392954 we have a totally different attitude on lots of things in scotland
9392955 scotland should always be a stand alone nation at whatever i believe
9392956 does an extra 8 feet of saltwater inside your home leave you feeling anxious and depressed talk to your doctor about zoloft today
9392957 your house is destroyed your job is gone and nobody seems to care try not caring either try zoloft today
9392958 i can never forgive jamba juice for destroying my life
9392959 who were you thinking of when we were making love last night was it a good looking stranger or a close friend of mine
9392960 i can never forgive jamba juice for destroying my life
9392961 who were you thinking of when we were making love last night was it a good looking stranger or a close friend of mine
9392962 i can never forgive jamba juice for destroying my life
9392963 who were you thinking of when we were making love last night was it a good looking stranger or a close friend of mine
9392964 i can never forgive jamba juice for destroying my life
9392965 who were you thinking of when we were making love last night was it a good looking stranger or a close friend of mine
9392966 i can never forgive jamba juice for destroying my life
9392967 it turns out the women of america arent finished yet
9392968 there are going to be some really fascinating conversations that are going to come up around gender in some ways that nobody expected
9392969 we dont take that lightly we just dont think he has a message we dont think hes good for women
9392970 i think the democratic party took women for granted in the primary they didnt step on sexism when they should have and i cant support them
9392971 the fact that he went out on a limb to pick a woman im very impressed by that
9392972 it doesnt make sense to me that frankly emilys list didnt hold them accountable for having been elected on that platform but then not supporting that platform
9392973 the setback for the pro choice movement is almost deserved
9392974 we are hosting the convention we are not putting it on i am not hoping that the republicans have a better event inside the arena than my party did but to know us is to love us i think the twin cities can top denver in terms of what we have to offer
9392975 people used to call minneapolis the minneapple for crying out loud
9392976 we refer to ourselves and our cities as flyover land and think that the super bowl or the rnc will be somehow transformative it wont be
9392977 she comes off like a real oil patch kind of alaskan
9392978 at least she can shoot better than dick cheney i can tell you that for a fact
9392979 in a national forum that might be a little difficult to appreciate but shes a woman who doesnt back down
9392980 our governor is going to be vice president and we still dont have an olive garden
9392981 it shows the best thing about alaska which is that if you have any skill at all you can rise up
9392982 she is a strong woman who can wear a skirt and be proud of it
9392983 can you imagine having the mayor of wasilla as the vice president
9392984 former dnc chairman caught on film laughing about hurricane hitting during republican national convention
9392985 and you dont get that many bonus points doing it right the second time around
9392986 i am from the governemt and i am here to help
9392987 this is the worst possible thing that can happen to the republicans because it highlights the party turning its back on the poor and black populations
9392988 yes ansel good luck pinning this on a single democrat governor no fault to be placed on fema its crony leader or bush who completely ignored the situation for days
9392989 so the dems think it is funny that more people will lose their lives and property
9392990 maybe anderson cooper and the rest of the msm can get into the city and spread the same litany of absolute lies as they did last time
9392991 also it wasnt dems praying for biblical rains to disrupt a convention it was whack job republicans
9392992 never happened yes some folks died but the idea that there were bodies floating in the streets is part of the media manufactured myth
9392993 assuming pd puts all the blame on bush for lack of katrina response can i assume that bush gets the blame credit for the response to gustav which at the moment look superb
9392994 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9392995 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9392996 i was trying to get situated at home i was trying to get things so it would be halfway safe
9392997 youre torn do you leave it and worry about it or do you stay and worry about living
9392998 theres really no place to go all the hotels are booked up to little rock and beyond
9392999 if we flood again were goners i dont think were coming back
9393000 i think for people who havent left they really are die hards because theyre taking their lives in their hands
9393001 i cant see any reason why a person staring down the barrel of a category 3 or category 4 hurricane would want to see if they can try to outfox mother nature thats taking an awful risk with yourself and your family
9393002 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our backyard
9393003 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9393004 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9393005 i was trying to get situated at home i was trying to get things so it would be halfway safe
9393006 youre torn do you leave it and worry about it or do you stay and worry about living
9393007 theres really no place to go all the hotels are booked up to little rock and beyond
9393008 if we flood again were goners i dont think were coming back
9393009 i think for people who havent left they really are die hards because theyre taking their lives in their hands
9393010 i cant see any reason why a person staring down the barrel of a category 3 or category 4 hurricane would want to see if they can try to outfox mother nature thats taking an awful risk with yourself and your family
9393011 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our backyard
9393012 there are some challenging figures here for british employers with a quarter of the workforce saying they are not satisfied with their jobs and almost one in three saying that their employers do not engage with them
9393013 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9393014 im happy to report to you that the coordination and the work thats being done at all levels appears to be excellent
9393015 our hearts go out to the people of new orleans and the gulf coast this time
9393016 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans not as republicans
9393017 the experience that she comes from is with what shes done in the government and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9393018 we expected to see evidence of big improvements since our last investigation but weve been sadly disappointed
9393019 with so many of us buying our food in these supermarkets their collective behaviour can heavily influence the nations eating habits despite their claims the supermarkets all still have a long way to go to help customers choose and enjoy a healthier diet
9393020 this report rightly recognises the huge numbers of discounts and promotions retailers are offering cash strapped customers and their achievements in informing customers and reformulating products
9393021 there are significant psychosocial benefits associated with insulin pump therapy particularly improved quality of life the new nice guidelines should facilitate greater access to this therapy which will only be good news for patients and their families for children it should have a positive impact on both their school and home life
9393022 the new guidance should hopefully open up access to children and their families and pumps are then provided according to need choice and suitability
9393023 a bunch of them have dropped nebuad like hot potatoes
9393024 we do not have any specific business updates at this point
9393025 naturally if there is a way to take a meager slice of that revenue in some way its something which companies will want to look at
9393026 they all looked at the financial opportunity and didnt think about the repercussions they didnt realize what problems they would get when they got exposed
9393027 there will be a long time to go before anyone is making any decisions with any finality
9393028 whenever the congressional committee with the regulatory authority over your industry expresses concerns with your technology
9393029 to study the issues raised about the nebuad system by your committee privacy advocates and others
9393030 we have to work out in society what we believe is a good exchange
9393031 when that happens we want to be ready to move forward

9393034 it is great defending super bowl champs i look good in blue
9393035 i feel good to be here staying in the division so not really much of a difference as far as guys you are going against and i just feel good to be here to be wanted and i am just looking forward to doing some good things on this defense
9393036 he really gets after it and kind of put his own niche on kind of the defense that we were running there in philly it is good for me because there is a lot of movement which allows for guys like me a chance to kind of move and get after the quarterback a little bit
9393037 it goes without saying but john is an all time great safety one of the leagues classiest professionals and his elite play speaks for itself
9393038 as has been the case in other situations i would not rule anything out down the road
9393039 i have no regrets about my time thus far with the patriots
9393040 the immense respect that ive long held for the organization has been only heightened over the past couple of weeks i am going to keep all options open and look forward with excitement to see what the future brings
9393041 i wasnt here in the past so i dont really know if he had a lack of dedication in the past
9393042 i mean i know what i read and i know what circulates in nfl circles
9393043 but when we sat down coming here we said were going to give this guy every benefit of the doubt and hes got to show us that he is dedicated and hes done everything that weve asked him to do and we feel very good about our decision to extend him
9393044 you guys see it out there we see it out there
9393045 hes done an excellent job in the weight room the meeting room hes come out there and hes jumped out at us on tape he looks good in the preseason so everything weve seen since we got here hes done everything weve asked him to do
9393046 to come back and clear my name is important to me
9393047 hes shown us that he can play so we didnt want him to make the free agent market
9393048 there is no technical reason that a third party could not accumulate and assemble the hardware components in an apple labeled computer hardware system such that said system would be capable of running the mac os
9393049 the kernel panic is self induced by apples embedding of code to prevent operability on computer hardware systems that are not apple labeled computer hardware systems
9393050 there is a real risk the driver will become overwhelmed as the number of in car systems multiply
9393051 there are so many potential demands on driver attention from these new systems that they could prove distracting
9393052 we consulted drivers and experts and a lot of literature about driver response to safety systems using a user centred design approach
9393053 the project also raised awareness in europe about the importance of interface issues for road safety and aide has put in car hmi on the agenda in europe
9393054 many of our partners will continue aides work adapting elements of it to their own cars and trucks while many of the equipment manufacturers are looking on aide like systems to be implemented in their vehicles
9393055 there might be a move towards some standards over time but in the short term manufacturers will deploy proprietary implementations
9393056 right now we are putting the finishing touches to our reporting and dissemination work in aide but we will be pursuing new research initiatives after that
9393057 is believed to have taken over as rsms political religious and strategic leader
9393058 were not only disappointed and frustrated over the governments decision to turn its back on the ancestral domain deal weve completely lost trust and confidence in them
9393059 the fate of the peace negotiation rests solely in the hands of the government
9393060 i make them as quickly as i can quicker than the other fellow if i can
9393061 often my haste is a mistake but i live with the consequences without complaint
9393062 dan quayle had not been briefed you know and prepared for some of the questions
9393063 he said give me pluses and minuses on each of these people
9393064 the crisis was triggered by the winter weather but caused by chronic mismanagement
9393065 its a good idea hydropower is one of the few resources that tajikistan can exploit
9393066 power lines could go to afghanistan and pakistan which are both energy starved countries and to the rest of central asia as well
9393067 that theres nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies and feeling their breath on your cheek
9393068 one person in two billion will live to be 116 or older
9393069 my position has always been exceptions of rape incest and the life of the mother
9393070 and by the way i think thats the view of most people that rape incest the life of the mother are issues that have to be considered
9393071 it is out of the platform we were told early on that the platform is going to be pro life and that any differences the senator has with it are his own
9393072 the convention is in st paul and we should just say that
9393073 i think its dopey to say anything else just dopey
9393074 its a little bit of a sting and a little bit of pride
9393075 it should say st paul minneapolis but i realize we lost the alphabet war a long time ago
9393076 shared user experience mobility and location dependency are all key features of web 2 0 on top of this comes the fact that web 2 0 services generally must be rapid to implement and easy to change in moves that frequently turn the user into a provider
9393077 this is precisely the situation our mobile widget runtime is designed to take account of the solution here is to create close intermeshing of the web and the mobile phone
9393078 when i clicked on the denny napi video it said no longer available
9393079 i agree with you barrys imaginary publisher not one point in your listing is
9393080 its a phenomenal promotion vehicle for a company or a great crisis tool or a great customer service tool
9393081 were trying to be as open and disclose as much information as we can
9393082 we gave a very loud voice to the people who said they werent happy about this decision
9393083 the blog at least helps people see how we think about it
9393084 thats the importance of public relations of advertising of everything we do
9393085 it is the virtual substitute for bill marriott visiting every hotel
9393086 anybody that weve hired in the past couple of years i think any of them would tell you that they read the blog heavily to get a sense of our people
9393087 the design was fantastic it just made me feel like i want to be part of something this good
9393088 but in the case of bodog nobody the processors wants to do business with them due to their high profile and the problems they are having with the us government
9393089 there is a problem with the media gushing over him barack obama too much
9393090 the coverage after that i was watching from msnbc i mean these guys were ready to have sex with him
9393091 how many houses does palin add to the republican ticket
9393092 its not commentary its not their left wing loons at night its not that its nbc news version of hard news coverage of the presidential campaign i am just sick almost sick that this is going on
9393093 given room to both sides whereas only one side had it before
9393094 we decided to get on youtube sometime during late 2007 we werent sure if this would work we were sort of testing the waters but the response has been simply great we keep getting many emails from foreigners saying that they loved our videos and want to go in for one of our special holiday packages
9393095 off ns that what was a strength yesterday becomes the root of weakness today we tend to depend on what ther revenues
9393096 i wouldnt doubt that there are a lot of backstroms around
9393097 i think it will be a great resource for people who want to do art history in connecticut
9393098 in the second year well try to make a systematic effort to find the art
9393099 always made enough money to live on i never had to worry
9393100 im hoping the public will be able to add more information
9393101 i can manage the cooking too but i wish there were 48 hours in a day
9393102 they end up pampering the child this may further affect the personality of the child
9393103 the child may develop mistrust and rebellious tendencies from lack of affection
9393104 early deprivation in the child may lead to lack of confidence sense of fear about the inconsistent world insecurity lack of initiative shame and doubt poor communication skills and revengeful nature
9393105 personality disorders such as schizophrenia if genetic factors and other precipitating factors are available in the immediate environment
9393106 the artificially fed infant deprived of maternal warmth may also develop growth problems including obesity parents should spend quality time with their baby whenever possible
9393107 the high level of stress also leads to hormonal changes infertility and marital disharmony in couples
9393108 there are cases of women suffering from depression because they could not go to work after having children
9393109 society expects you to get married have a child we are not crusading against having a child or anything but it is a lifetime responsibility
9393110 its almost impossible to bring up a child as a human being even if you say your child is non denominational the world insists on labelling it with a religious caste and national identity as soon as it is born
9393111 and having these identities means that anybody who does not share the same identity is different and is to be rejected hated or feared
9393112 the music i listen to every morning relieves me of the customary stress and strain that i am forced to battle during the course of the day
9393113 the rudimentary aspects of music that play a major role in therapy are its cadence modulation and lyrics
9393114 soothing sounds have a relaxing effect and they lower the heart rate reducing anxiety and stress the type of music that a person listens to plays an important role in his recovery
9393115 these children usually tend to be noisy they move their arms and legs involuntarily and push each other around as they are restless in nature music teaches them controlled behavior and discipline of course incentives have to be provided to them during their music classes
9393116 we often just presume that there are some children who are non receptive to music on the contrary we see these very kids nodding their heads in time while the others around them sing and clap hands it always comes as a pleasant surprise to me
9393117 music therapy works only on patients who are musically inclined those people who have been indifferent to music during the course of their life tend to experience violent emotional outbursts
9393118 i just want the driver of the truck to know that no one in our family is holding him responsible for this
9393119 i talked with her every day and she kept saying she didnt want to go on living like this
9393120 we tried to get mom to come back with us but she didnt want to move
9393121 id just like to talk with him and say no is blaming him
9393122 im not a sex addict i have never been to those meetings its hurtful to my family and if i was involved with a woman in a monogamous relationship it would be hurtful to her
9393123 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9393124 it goes without saying but john is an all time great safety one of the leagues classiest professionals and his elite play speaks for itself
9393125 as has been the case in other situations i would not rule anything out down the road

9393140 wir haben immer vor gro fusionen gewarnt das mindeste was wir jetzt vom commerzbank vorstand erwarten ist eine mehrj hrige umfangreiche sozialvertr gliche gestaltung des prozesses
9393141 alle hebel in bewegung setzen um die gef hrdeten arbeitspl tze zu retten
9393142 aus der integration der beiden h user ergibt sich ein effizienzsteigerungs und synergiepotenzial das f r die aktion re des neuen instituts die chance auf erhebliche wertsteigerungen er ffnet
9393143 mit insgesamt 1 200 filialen wird die bank k nftig f r privat und gesch ftskunden noch besser erreichbar sein
9393144 das ist eine unternehmensentscheidung dazu werden wir uns nicht u ern
9393145 i wasnt here in the past so i dont really know if he had a lack of dedication in the past
9393146 i mean i know what i read and i know what circulates in nfl circles
9393147 but when we sat down coming here we said were going to give this guy every benefit of the doubt and hes got to show us that he is dedicated and hes done everything that weve asked him to do and we feel very good about our decision to extend him
9393148 you guys see it out there we see it out there
9393149 hes done an excellent job in the weight room the meeting room hes come out there and hes jumped out at us on tape he looks good in the preseason so everything weve seen since we got here hes done everything weve asked him to do
9393150 to come back and clear my name is important to me
9393151 hes shown us that he can play so we didnt want him to make the free agent market
9393152 i wasnt here in the past so i dont really know if he had a lack of dedication in the past
9393153 i mean i know what i read and i know what circulates in nfl circles
9393154 but when we sat down coming here we said were going to give this guy every benefit of the doubt and hes got to show us that he is dedicated and hes done everything that weve asked him to do and we feel very good about our decision to extend him
9393155 you guys see it out there we see it out there
9393156 hes done an excellent job in the weight room the meeting room hes come out there and hes jumped out at us on tape he looks good in the preseason so everything weve seen since we got here hes done everything weve asked him to do
9393157 to come back and clear my name is important to me
9393158 hes shown us that he can play so we didnt want him to make the free agent market
9393159 all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
9393160 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of the president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9393161 there is very little doubt that we have to go from a party event to the call to the nation for action action to help our fellow citizens in this time of tragedy and disaster action in the form of volunteering donations reaching out our hands and our hearts and our wallets to the people who are under such great threat from this great natural disaster
9393162 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention if necessary to act as americans not republicans because america needs us now no matter whether we are republican or democrat
9393163 theres communication with the delegations in terms of making sure they have what they need and with the gulf state governors
9393164 i dont like the idea of being that far away but we already had our plane tickets and hotel and hopefully the convention will be enjoyable and will keep our mind off of the storm theres a lot of angst and anxiety involved especially after katrina in 2005
9393165 was a black eye for the bush administration im concerned about our property and our citizens and im concerned about media coverage
9393166 will appear to be callous and insensitive again to the gulf coast community it has to be delicate the way its handled
9393167 i just want the driver of the truck to know that no one in our family is holding him responsible for this
9393168 i talked with her every day and she kept saying she didnt want to go on living like this
9393169 we tried to get mom to come back with us but she didnt want to move
9393170 id just like to talk with him and say no is blaming him
9393171 reached across party lines to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
9393172 its so insidious the way it turns your mind against you
9393173 its the closest i can imagine to hearing voices or being possessed it really does feel alien like something else is at work inside you
9393174 the most tragic consequence is the psychiatric spiral it causes
9393175 we know children of mothers with postpartum depression have more emotional problems as adults for instance they struggle to develop and sustain healthy relationships
9393176 new mothers are very sensitive to the idea they should be good mothers that their maternal function is paramount
9393177 when they perceive theyre failing in that role it creates both shame and a tendency to conceal it
9393178 the goal is to make postpartum depression a more mainstream conversation
9393179 thats the first step in getting women to realize they can do something about the problem
9393180 i would hope anyone who feels the way i did would see a doctor and if the doctor brushes her off she should find another
9393181 no one should have to deal with it themselves no one deserves to feel that way
9393182 im definitely very excited with the opportunity to go out there and make the postseason
9393183 you play this game to win a world championship so thats hopefully what well be able to try to accomplish
9393184 well just see hes going to play some second base for us and so will augie
9393185 like a lot of our other positions that are a little uncertain right now well match up and see whos playing well and try to run the best lineup out there that particular day
9393186 our scouts like his arm they said good fastball hes got pretty good strikeout numbers we drafted him out of high school so obviously we have a little bit of a history with him
9393187 we just feel fortunate that we were able to get a decent guy we liked
9393188 the thing about it is its where all that matters is whether you win or lose it doesnt matter the stats or anything like that at the end of the day the only thing that anybody cares about is if you got something in the w column or not
9393189 david eckstein is a very good player and a guy at this point that has a chance to fit an area that has changed a little bit based on orlando hudsons injury in that regard we thought it made sense
9393190 hes been a big part of two teams that won a world series at this stage hes still a plus on base guy he plays hard and hes been a part of winning teams and were glad to have him
9393191 mit der zusammenlegung zweier privater banken ist f r uns die konkurrenz nicht gr er geworden im gegenteil diese bank wird zwei jahre mit sich selbst besch ftigt sein bevor der markt verst rkt bearbeitet werden kann
9393192 das macht eine restrukturierung erforderlich bekanntlich hei t dies personalabbau was zus tzlich bedeutet dass der kunde seinen vertrauten berater verliert alles nicht einfach deshalb muss die neue kombination erst einmal beweisen was sie kann
9393193 es gab massiven protest und widerstand auf der arbeitnehmerseite gegen den vorgesehenen arbeitsplatzabbau
9393194 der aufsichtsratsvorsitzende der allianz musste in der zweiten abstimmung gegen den widerstand der arbeitnehmer entscheiden
9393195 the swiss public prosecutor dropped charges against me because there was no substance in the charges
9393196 i belong to a business family i am not very rich but i am well off the propaganda against me in the media is evidence that i dont have the money to buy people
9393197 im predisposed to the portrait because at the root and core of what i do is the desire to connect communicate and collaborate with people
9393198 just be thankful for what youve got though you may not drive a great big cadillac diamond in the back sunroof top diggin the scene with a gangsta lean gangsta whitewalls tv antennas in the back
9393199 its been three years and new orleans is not all the way back together if another hurricane comes it will just be even longer for new orleans to get back
9393200 we dont need another storm putting more people out of their home again and leaving them to start from the beginning ive been through that
9393201 i had the mentality in new orleans that a hurricane would come there because it hadnt come in years
9393202 now that ive been through it if they say leave ill leave i have a baby now i dont know where id go but im going
9393203 i dont want to see this city get another one
9393204 we wouldve never thought that we could possibly be facing another katrina in our lifetime even if it doesnt come the frenzy of it all its crazy my home may never be the same again
9393205 doug said lets go up to chattanooga and look for a house
9393206 so we would have a safe place for the children to come should they have to evacuate
9393207 when people dont have much money they cut on big stuff and buy things that make their lives a little bit better like consumer electronics
9393208 the overall market in 2008 is not very good and europe is even worse
9393209 we are seeing people are more sensitive to promotional deals but have not seen signs of consumers turning to third tier brands
9393210 were not planning to subsidise this exchange rate swing at all well either find ways of reducing the costs still further or we may have to adjust prices upwards
9393211 we have not seen an impact on consumer spending yet
9393212 i see prices for blu ray devices to come down more and more before christmas
9393213 i mean lahat ng shows namin pareho lang kami so dito coming from him sobrang na appreciate ko talaga na sinabi niya na matagal ko nang hinihintay ito itong project tsaka alam nyo naman kung gaano ko kamahal to at kung gaano karami ang isinasakripisyo ko dahil sa proyekto na ito
9393214 oo naman sobra kasi parang konting adjustment na lang ang gagawin ko
9393215 oo siyempre nakakalungkot din ikaw may officemate ka for ten years or eight years tapos biglang aalis e di ba parang nakakalungkot naman yon e kung sa pbb pinoy big brother nga at sa pda p inoy dream academy konting span pa lang yung napagsamahan nila naiiyak na sila e ano pa kaya yung sa amin
9393216 siguro hindi pa handa at hindi pa handa ang lahat ng supporters namin para tanggapin sana nga hindi na mag end
9393217 sa totoo lang tinawagan ako ni tita mariole alberto to tell me na oy okey yung movie ni john lloyd at ni sarah ang naramdaman ko noon is happiness siguro po kung nangyari yon nung depressed stage ko siguro mas lalo akong mate threaten o mas lalo akong kakabahan pero since i am doing this betty la fea alam ko na ito ang ibinigay sa akin ng diyos eto muna dito muna ako magko concentrate siyempre happy ako at mahal na mahal ko si direk cathy garcia molina sobra
9393218 so i had to ask sina mr m johnny manahan at si tita mariole para makipag meeting para sabihin lang kung meron po ba kahit support lang wala silang masabi sa akin
9393219 oo yun ang sinabi ko meron kasing meeting talaga wala silang masabi sa akin yun pala all along alam na nila na gagawin ko yung betty hindi lang nila sinasabi sa akin
9393220 nag ano ako belly dancing class ako nag singapore ako hindi naman sobrang depressed na nagrebelde out of depression ha yung depression na nasa utak ko all the time iniisip ko kung ano ang gagawin ko tapos meron pa akong naisip noon na ano kaya kung mag aral muna kaya ako may ganung moment
9393221 hindi loyal talaga ako sa kapamilya naniniwala ako sa produkto natin
9393222 nung sinabi na nila sa akin nung binigyan na nila ako ng re assurance na dahil sa loyalty mo at dahil mahal na mahal mo ang trabaho mo were giving you this
9393223 sumayaw ako ng belly dancing kasi sinasabi ko yun sa mga kaibigan ko sila yung mga ka share ko sila yung mga kasama ko sa mga trips ko
9393224 hindi si shaina kasi busy noon sa lobo kumare ako na si betty ganun tuwang tuwa kami nagkaroon kami ng drinking session sa bahay for girls only pero may mga guys din na classmates ko nung high school
9393225 its definitely a hit to our team to say that hes not missed would be ridiculous to say
9393226 but theres nothing we can do about it now we cant sit here and wish and wait and hope and all that all we can do is play ball and weve got to play ball with the guys that are out there
9393227 whoevers in there we have to prepare im still optimistic
9393228 ill talk about the guys that are here i cant do anything about that guy
9393229 clearly we wish he had come in wish he had been at our minicamps and with us but hes not so well leave it right there
9393230 if the time comes where he comes back then well welcome him back and move forward
9393231 right now hes not here and weve got a football game to play in a week
9393232 winning thats been one of my biggest goals since i got on the pga tour
9393233 ive always known that im a good player but ive always believed that i can improve
9393234 im not one of those guys that make like big changes in my swing or just drastic stuff i like to take it one step at a time we can call it baby steps
9393235 ive been getting better and better every year and thats one of my goals well keep working to continue it that way and become one of the best players in the world
9393236 and yes theres a little bitter sweet taste when you work so hard and you havent won when you see young guys winning and you go like man its about my time
9393237 its only my third year on tour and ive learned about myself year after year believe it or not one of the things ive learned this year is that theres no need to practice as much
9393238 theres no need to bang balls and balls and balls but just whenever you have a good thought whenever you have a good feeling just keep it flowing and go with it
9393239 im just so happy to be out here and im just trying to be myself
9393240 every time i step on the golf course im trying to be the best i can by trying to be myself the way i play golf the way i dress the way i treat people etcetera etcetera
9393241 there was a nice big kiss at the end with both hands on the cheeks
9393242 we did a great job the way you win doesnt really matter
9393243 hes been dominant since he came over and hopefully he and rest of the team will take us to the promised land
9393244 porto informs the market that it has arrived at an agreement in principle with inter for the definitive transfer of rights to quaresma
9393245 it goes without saying but john is an all time great safety one of the leagues classiest professionals and his elite play speaks for itself
9393246 as has been the case in other situations i would not rule anything out down the road
9393247 i have no regrets about my time thus far with the patriots
9393248 the immense respect that ive long held for the organization has been only heightened over the past couple of weeks i am going to keep all options open and look forward with excitement to see what the future brings
9393249 we cant take anything for granted because the moment we do that everything blows up
9393250 i think if you take care of the seconds the minutes and hours will take care of themselves
9393251 this team has a lot of confidence and im just glad to be a part of it
9393252 were getting things done and winning games in a lot of different ways its going to be an exciting september
9393253 i figured instead of spending my off day on the beach id go to new orleans and get my stuff out of there
9393254 with the hurricane coming i wanted to make sure i had something to come back to it was a hectic 24 hours packed up everything in my apartment
9393255 the atmosphere was kind of hectic the airport was pretty packed
9393256 the lines for people who were just buying tickets that day were pretty long there were a lot of people taking just one bag and going to family nearby and hopefully they would come back to something
9393257 she put all these balls back she didnt make any errors i was the one who was all over the place and i couldnt really find my rhythm in these kind of conditions
9393258 i had to change something to get myself together again and do the right things i did that i just cruised through the second and third set and happy to get through in this way
9393259 winning thats been one of my biggest goals since i got on the pga tour
9393260 ive always known that im a good player but ive always believed that i can improve
9393261 im not one of those guys that make like big changes in my swing or just drastic stuff i like to take it one step at a time we can call it baby steps
9393262 ive been getting better and better every year and thats one of my goals well keep working to continue it that way and become one of the best players in the world
9393263 and yes theres a little bitter sweet taste when you work so hard and you havent won when you see young guys winning and you go like man its about my time
9393264 its only my third year on tour and ive learned about myself year after year believe it or not one of the things ive learned this year is that theres no need to practise as much
9393265 theres no need to bang balls and balls and balls but just whenever you have a good thought whenever you have a good feeling just keep it flowing and go with it
9393266 im just so happy to be out here and im just trying to be myself
9393267 every time i step on the golf course im trying to be the best i can by trying to be myself the way i play golf the way i dress the way i treat people etcetera etcetera
9393268 its the discipline of our defense and knowing where everyone else is going to be
9393269 hes a playmaking guy whos been able to have a little bit of freedom we just have to make sure he stays a little more disciplined
9393270 anytime youve got a guy in there with a lot of experience but hes been in different systems there are communication issues weve had a couple missed plays in games where we didnt get exactly the call we wanted to get but for the most part i think its gone well
9393271 ill stay ready to play own up to what i did and be back for miami
9393272 its like i tell my mom i play football but im not going to do it in a preseason game eight days before the opener
9393273 he accomplished a no hitter and wasnt given what he deserved that should have been a no hitter
9393274 thats a stinking no hitter we all got cheated from i feel horrible for cc
9393275 thats a joke that wasnt even close whoever the scorekeeper was absolutely denied major league baseball a nice no hitter right there
9393276 they threw hit up on the board even before laroche hit the bag thats a play cc makes easily throws him out by 10 feet to me its a no brainer
9393277 the way the ball came off the bat it was spinning and it went to the left of the mound with a left handed pitcher going to get it its a difficult play
9393278 the definition requires standard effort and that would have taken more than an ordinary effort the runner was well down the line
9393279 the ball was still rolling and i probably should have picked it up with my glove we probably wouldnt be having this conversation
9393280 i think if i pick it up with my glove i get him
9393281 id like to think it was a hit from a selfish standpoint id like it to be a hit but you could make a case either way but im hitting 160 i need every hit i can get
9393282 hes been dominant since he came over and hopefully he and rest of the team will take us to the promised land
9393283 der k ndigungsschutz bis ende 2011 war die grundlage f r unsere zustimmung zu dieser transaktion
9393284 weve been playing good all year i think especially to split the series here in chicago against the cubs at home i think it says a lot
9393285 why is it frustrating why should it be are we supposed to win every day i dont think so
9393286 listen if we could get guys in every time we got men on base wed be 162 0 and thats not going to happen
9393287 what the hell am i supposed to be not ok
9393288 in any situation if you can minimize damage and limit it to singles it forces them to have to hit the ball more often to score runs and they scored two
9393289 wir haben immer vor gro fusionen gewarnt das mindeste was wir jetzt vom commerzbank vorstand erwarten ist eine mehrj hrige umfangreiche sozialvertr gliche gestaltung des prozesses
9393290 alle hebel in bewegung setzen um die gef hrdeten arbeitspl tze zu retten
9393291 aus der integration der beiden h user ergibt sich ein effizienzsteigerungs und synergiepotenzial das f r die aktion re des neuen instituts die chance auf erhebliche wertsteigerungen er ffnet
9393292 mit insgesamt 1200 filialen wird die bank k nftig f r privat und gesch ftskunden noch besser erreichbar sein
9393293 das ist eine unternehmensentscheidung dazu werden wir uns nicht u ern
9393294 weve had our backs up against the wall a lot lately and even more now
9393295 the seasons getting shorter we dont have many games left
9393296 weve just got to continue it weve got 25 26 games left we just need to continue to play this way and well be fine
9393297 not real pleased youve got to sit there and watch 180 pitches everyday id rather have the fastball thrown over the plate and have people hit it instead of giving runs away like that it will be addressed
9393298 parental alienation is about people who narcissistically project their whole reality onto a child i dont need you so the child doesnt need you
9393299 the goal of the alienating parent is to kill contiguous time people need reliability they need regularity and ive been the victim of a campaign to kill all that you wind up being more an uncle than a father
9393300 i said youve got to come over here and look at this
9393301 in spite of the fact that you dont look like a young leading man anymore id quite like to throw you down on this blanket right now
9393302 basically it was daniels the outlaw im the riverboat gambler who gets all the bleep the shallow good looking sap stephens the village idiot and hes the bleep ing hero hes the one who saves the day at the end hes the clint eastwood thats the movie he wanted to make about his brothers
9393303 there was a nice big kiss at the end with both hands on the cheeks
9393304 we could run a nice blog here if we didnt have all these members getting in the way
9393305 we are hoping and praying that people in the hurricanes path are evacuated quickly and will remain safe there are 45 000 people in minneapolis saint paul and the surrounding area for the convention and we have been planning for more than a year to make sure they feel welcome and enjoy their stay as a host committee we will remain flexible and work closely with the committee on arrangements for the republican national committee to do whatever is necessary to accomplish the goals of the convention and to take care of our visitors minnesotans are known for their generous spirit and willingness to help in a crisis and weve already taken many calls from our partnering companies asking what they can do to help
9393306 knowing the devastation caused by hurricanes katrina and rita its critical that we can provide residents a safe place for their animals before the storm hits so residents dont hesitate to evacuate and so they can focus on keeping themselves safe
9393307 the state and the responding organizations are applying the lessons learned from those storms and their aftermath to increase the effectiveness of these evacuations and most importantly the safety of the people and their pets
9393308 we are deeply concerned about the safety and welfare of the residents of the gulf state region our top priority is to assist those who will be affected by hurricane gustav this is not a time for politics or celebration it is a time for us to come together as americans and assist the residents of the gulf states
9393309 in order for the republican party to officially exist and for senator mccain to qualify for the ballot we are by law required to conduct specific official business at this point our program on monday has been scaled back and will only include what party rules governing the nomination of our candidates for president and vice president require we will perform the official business as required in addition we have set aside time to make delegates and americans watching our proceedings at home aware of what they can do to assist in relief efforts designed to help those who will be affected by hurricane gustav
9393310 at some point between monday and thursday evening we will convene once again to complete the activities needed to qualify senator mccain and governor palin for the ballot in all 50 states beyond that all we can say is that we will monitor what is happening and make decisions about other convention business as details become available
9393311 the safety and well being of the people of the gulf states remains our top concern we are doing everything we can on the ground in minneapolis saint paul to ensure that the delegations affected by this storm have the resources and information that they need as senator mccain said this morning we must redirect our attention and efforts we will act as americans not republicans to help our fellow citizens in need
9393312 we appreciate the thoughts and prayers of everyone around the country as we prepare for this dangerous storm we are here in minnesota for the necessary job of nominating our choice for president and vice president but obviously our focus is on our families and friends back at home we are in constant communication with our governors and elected officials and feel confident that they are taking the appropriate and necessary steps to prepare the purpose of this group is to discuss ways that we can come together to provide information and support for our delegates here in minneapolis
9393313 there are significant psychosocial benefits associated with insulin pump therapy particularly improved quality of life the new nice guidelines should facilitate greater access to this therapy which will only be good news for patients and their families for children it should have a positive impact on both their school and home life
9393314 the new guidance should hopefully open up access to children and their families and pumps are then provided according to need choice and suitability
9393315 this grew out of our business strategy and our partnership with kingston hospital where the royal marsden is running the new sir william rous unit in conjunction with kingston hospital nhs trust and macmillan cancer support
9393316 we needed an underpinning it strategy to support that and to provide clinicians with access to our systems from around our cancer network and possibly from home we did have remote access but it was not very slick we wanted to be able to give people access to the applications they needed to deliver care in better more secure way
9393317 we have a reasonably sophisticated model for secure access by user and by workstation
9393318 so if a user is at a workstation that does not come up to our specification then we can stop them accessing information even if they are an approved user
9393319 anything less and they would only get some applications probably just email
9393320 quite a lot of the thin client solutions we looked at used compression but we need to make sure clinicians could see x rays at high quality
9393321 the london programme for it is developing a strategy to make that kind of access available but we needed an interim solution until it is ready
9393322 we used to be tied to specific places but now we have begun to move away from that now i think we expect staff to come up with ideas for using the technology to deliver services in new and flexible ways
9393323 the quality of care provided at the royal marsden and its partners is world class and it is only right that it is supported by effective and resilient it systems
9393324 in a very short space of time this system has moved from proof of concept to nhs best practice
9393325 the best 17 i thought took the park wed love for him to be able to play but in terms of the selection it was pretty clear cut
9393326 we need you to be fully focused on your job
9393327 were going to have to find something we havent shown too often this season
9393328 with what weve done previously in australia we have a long way to go
9393329 getting back to what weve been doing well focusing on what we do well
9393330 its not bad standing at halfway and watching wade mckinnon and guys score tries
9393331 the feeding america network is a critical part of the disaster relief infrastructure
9393332 feeding america is one of dozens of relief organizations providing an array of relief services in this situation our primary mission remains providing emergency food distribution throughout the year in times of disaster like these we ramp up operations significantly to help communities caught in the grip of tragedy
9393333 feeding america will deploy its immediate disaster area reconnaissance team idart as soon as it is safe and practicable
9393334 this team will be deployed to assess the type and amount of assistance that will be needed from our network of food banks and will expand as necessary
9393335 search and enter the persons name and pre disaster phone number or address
9393336 my favorite moment in todays race was coming back through disneys california adventure and seeing mrs incredible and sully cheering us on
9393337 i had to make my way through all the other runners
9393338 but it was a great race with so many people out there cheering us on that really made it special
9393339 the health care needs of gulf coast veterans dont disappear during the hurricane season
9393340 were resolved to continue providing veterans with services whenever possible and reconstituting services as quickly as possible when they have had to be curtailed because of the storm
9393341 veterans in the affected area who need emergency medical care should considering going to the nearest civilian facility if they would risk their health by traveling to a va hospital or clinic
9393342 my mom who really idolized my dad had the effect on us of kind of idolizing him
9393343 we continue to show steady growth despite the slowdown in the global economy thus far in 2008 our fuel subsidiaries both in israel and europe performed well as a result of the successful fuel retail strategy we have put in place focusing on convenience stores and capitalizing on economies of scale in addition our automotive holdings continued to perform well with strong growth in sales however the ongoing refining margin erosion in the us as well as the weaker financial and real estate sectors offset this strong growth in addition the high inflation rate in israel negatively impacted our bottom line by increasing our financial expenses
9393344 despite these challenges our cash position remains very strong standing at nis 1 3 billion we continue to see substantial opportunities for the group particularly in the areas of energy and infrastructure and in this regard we recently raised an additional nis 420 million with our ability to leverage our broad experience and global presence supported by our strong and yet diversified asset base we believe we are well positioned to build and create long term shareholder value our strong commitment to this goal is also very much demonstrated by the recent share buy back program we commenced having purchased 112 000 shares for nis 48 million since july 2008
9393345 ivabradine was always known to relieve ischemia with the beautiful results ivabradine is the first antianginal treatment shown to reduce myocardial infarction and revascularisation and to have a good tolerability profile even when used with other drugs this is the gold standard for any antianginal anti ischemic drug
9393346 often a lot of investigations are performed in coronary patients but a simple heart rate measurement is not done beautiful has reinforced the need to measure heart rate in all cad patients and if the heart rate is more than 70 bpm to reduce it by using ivabradine on top of background therapy
9393347 half of the cad patients have a resting heart rate more than 70 bpm these patients can now benefit from a treatment that will greatly reduce their chances of having another heart attack or needing further surgery
9393348 the mississippi gaming commission has issued an order for our casino to close however our hotel which is not located on the water remains open we are taking all safety precautions and encourage our guests and employees to seek shelter in a safe area
9393349 my mom who really idolized my dad had the effect on us of kind of idolizing him
9393350 i not only idolized him but i also understood that he had flaws like all of us
9393351 john mccain is an eager cold eyed politician who has sought the white house for a decade compromised and reversed himself and believes he is an actor in a grand unfolding saga he is also more comfortable with shades of gray than he appears a sense of nuance rooted it seems in an early life in which he at once revered his father and felt sorry for him
9393352 the republicans will do their best to match the democrats soaring rhetoric
9393353 is more about who is the best dream merchant make no mistake both candidates and both parties have dreams to sell or more accurately they have different versions of the same dream the american dream in the end the election is likely to go to the candidate who best argues his dream is the more authentic and his approach the most american

9393355 politics like all professions isnt as easy as it looks palins odds of emerging unscathed are slim in fact shes been all but set up for failure
9393356 possible that palin is so talented that she will prove to be the face of the gops future more likely this hail sarah pass wont do much to help john mccain get into the end zone hell win or lose for other reasons
9393357 has finally assumed the leadership of the conservative movement by disavowing the same rebellious tradition he once cherished to date in his challenge to barack obama he has run an entirely conventional conservative republican campaign but while the attacks may prove effective they hardly feel subversive dramatic or new
9393358 even the choice of sarah palin a reliable social conservative and tax cutter
9393359 is less interested in being dramatic for the sake of principle than he is in being dramatic for dramas sake
9393360 this shock to the system has the capacity to alter the already fragile psychology of the consumer
9393361 and make no mistake deducting the price of a pair of shoes directly from your bank account packs a much more potent emotional punch than charging the pair of allen edmonds loafers on your american express platinum card
9393362 the government cant be in the position of paying any price that a manufacturer names there ought to be some kind of ability to set prices
9393363 that high income group is a very small percentage of the elderly there arent enough of them to make much of a dent if the goal is to save money
9393364 american consumers and businesses seemed to regard globalization and free trade as net positives the integration of china and the former soviet bloc into the trading system lowered inflation opened new markets and brought billions of workers into the labor force
9393365 but in this decade rampant growth in emerging markets has mercilessly boosted prices for energy and commodities competition from foreign workers has tamped down wage growth and the weak dollar has made u s companies vulnerable to foreign buyers as a result americans are now more inclined to see themselves as victims of globalization rather than as beneficiaries of it a los angeles times bloomberg poll this spring found that 50 percent of respondents said free trade hurt the economy while only 26 percent said it helped
9393366 we are thrilled to have the alarmists join us at this historic event

9393371 previously the ontarget trial showed that telmisartan was as effective as the ace inhibitor ramipril in reducing the risk of cardio and cerebrovascular events but with a lower rate of discontinuations for high risk patients who cannot tolerate an ace inhibitor the transcend results could represent an important step forward
9393372 the landmark ontarget and transcend trials have contributed significant and important clinical information to the cardiovascular community and could help uncover new treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes and care
9393373 palin has national security experience because alaska is close to russsia
9393374 you know the experience that she comes from is what she has done in government and remember that alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia
9393375 im not sure what she brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative well shes a better speaker than mccain
9393376 i am i am up to the task of course of focusing on the challenges that face america
9393377 and i am very pleased with the situation that i am in when when you consider the situation now that alaska will be in
9393378 and that is alaska and alaskans will be allowed to contribute more to our great country and theyll be allowed to do that because i if were elected will be in a position of opening the eyes of the country to what it is that alaska is all about and what alaska has to offer so i am happy to and very honored to be asked to do this i know its going to be great for alaska

9393386 unlike many states in the us the uk does not have legislation compelling firms to alert their customers after unauthorised access to their personal data
9393387 the consequences of identity theft can be devastating both financially and emotionally for victims thats why the law is needed
9393388 for many years we have urged organisations to consider the impact on individuals privacy before developing new it systems
9393389 however progress has been disappointing in our view organisations could be doing more to protect individuals privacy by adopting privacy by design in the planning stages of any new project
9393390 in 2008 companies should view their domain name as intellectual property
9393391 business owners can save themselves from potential losses and disruption by ensuring that every domain is registered continually in the proprietors own name

9393401 it is absolutely clear that viticultural climates of tomorrow will not be as they are today
9393402 esta es una situaci n pr cticamente de emergencia y no vemos al gobierno regional haci ndole frente aqu solo se siente la seguridad cuando viene alg n poderoso del ejecutivo de lo contrario los tuyeron no tienen seguridad las 24 horas del d a ni durante la semana
9393403 lo primero que vamos a generar ser seguridad para esta zona que tendr un gobernador que enfrente el tema de la inseguridad ya basta que diariamente al menos dos personas pierdan la vida durante el mes pasado se contabilizaron 70 muertes a causa del hampa
9393404 estamos dispuestos a articular esfuerzos con el ministerio de interior y justicia yo espero que a ese despacho le duela lo que sucede en los valles del tuy
9393405 aqu los portaviones se acabaron no est en juego quien se toma m s fotos con el presidente ch vez aqu se elegir a quien presente las mejores ideas y proyectos que representen un verdadero cambio para los ciudadanos porque quien sea electo ser el gobernador o el alcalde y el presidente seguir ejerciendo
9393406 lo importante es que podamos articular pol ticas entre el gobierno regional y el local para fortalecer el proceso de descentralizaci n y darle calidad de vida a todos los mirandinos
9393407 de la mano del pr ximo gobernador del estado vamos a traer el cambio a los valles del tuy y acabaremos con el flagelo de la delincuencia para dar calidad de vida a los habitantes de esta zona decretaremos la emergencia en vialidad y rescataremos la econom a porque hasta los momentos es un pueblo donde s lo se duerme y por eso necesitamos que se active

9393412 money manager ex is a free open source cross platform easy to use personal finance software
9393413 we definitely have concerns about it especially after what happened three years ago
9393414 when katrina made landfall three years ago and the federal government failed everyone fire fighters were there during and after the storms rescuing tens of thousands from the floodwaters even while their own families were evacuated to other cities and their property destroyed
9393415 the iaff was on the ground providing support to fire fighters then and we are there ahead of the storm this time
9393416 the welcoming committee is a criminal enterprise made up of 35 anarchists who are intent on committing criminal acts before and during the republican national convention
9393417 these acts include tactics to blockade and disable delegate buses breaching venue security and injuring police officers they have recruited assistance in their criminal conspiracy from other anarchists groups throughout the country
9393418 i think friday nights raid was a scare tactic to not go to the big demonstration monday
9393419 it was a tactic to try and take out the leaders
9393420 i know some people dont like to go out in the streets but when anybody within a 12 hour drive hears about whats going on here theyre going to want to be here with us on monday
9393421 take off our republican hats and put on out american hats
9393422 from a party event to a call to the nation for action
9393423 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9393424 we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action action to help our fellow citizens in this time of tragedy and disaster action in the form of volunteering donations reaching out our hands and our hearts and our wallets to the people who are under such great threat from this great natural disaster
9393425 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention if necessary to act as americans not republicans because america needs us now no matter whether we are republican or democrat
9393426 we can activate an e mail list of a couple million people who want to give back
9393427 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9393428 a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out whats going on is fine
9393429 the thing that i always am concerned about in the middle of a storm
9393430 is whether were drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the secret service and various security requirements sometimes it pulls police fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job
9393431 im assuming that where he went that wasnt an issue were going to try to stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then well probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible
9393432 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9393433 were working with governors to identify and secure out of state shelter for people in the path of the storm
9393434 several states including missouri texas and new mexico are preparing to and have accepted a lot of evacuees people are leaving those areas that are of concern and were working hard to make sure that they have a place to go
9393435 in the coming days i encourage people across our nation to help their neighbors in need you can contribute to charities such as the red cross you can volunteer your time to help those in need and of course you can pray for those who might be suffering
9393436 the goal is to make sure that you take the conservative approach that were not seen to be out of touch with people who could have everything they worked for lost
9393437 id advise senator mccain to go down as is today to figure out what can i do
9393438 i think john mccains judgment is once again put at issue because hes chosen somebody who clearly does not meet the national security threshold who is not ready to be president tomorrow
9393439 i mean for heaven sakes the people who supported hillary clinton are not going to be seduced just because john mccain has picked a woman
9393440 oh i think so i think so compared to barack obama absolutely
9393441 wootens words were i will kill him hell eat a expletive lead bullet ill shoot him if our father got the attorney to help molly
9393442 i heard this death threat my 16 year old son heard it track palin molly heard it as did their small children wooten spoke with his trooper gun on his hip in an extremely intimidating fashion leaving no doubt he is serious about taking someones life who disagrees with him
9393443 my concern is that the publics faith in the troopers will continue to diminish as more residents express concerns regarding the apparent lack of action towards a trooper whom is described by many as a ticking time bomb and a loose cannon
9393444 wooten is my brother in law but this information is forwarded to you objectively
9393445 would lead a rational person to believe there is a problem inside the organization
9393446 wooten was counseled by my husband to join molly in acting civilly and with maturity during their divorce for the sake of the nine kids they and wootens girlfriend have between them all and who are adversely affected by their circumstances
9393447 i feel strongly that wooten is a loose cannon hes a ticking time bomb as others describe him and i am afraid his actions do not merely reflect poorly on the state but his actions may cause someone terrible harm
9393448 is it acceptable for an alaska state trooper to use his badge and power in these aforementioned ways
9393449 it appears for the world that ms mccann and her family have decided to take off for the guys livelihood that the bitterness of whatever who did what to whom has overridden good judgment
9393450 aesop told us not to slay the goose who lays the golden egg for whatever reason people are trying to slay the goose here and it tends to diminish his earning capacity
9393451 the record clearly indicates a serious and concentrated pattern of unacceptable and at times illegal activity occurring over a lengthy period which establishes a course of conduct totally at odds with the ethics of our profession
9393452 she said troopers like this one and my former brother in law or that trooper i used to be related to are the things that make people not trust troopers
9393453 i made an inquiry and was told by commissioner monegan that there was a process in place and that it was handled and it was over and i reported back to the first gentleman that there was nothing more that could be done
9393454 this is not your issue this is something i am supposed to handle every time we talk about this it is discoverable do you want this trooper to own your house
9393455 people in the administration made contact with the department of public safety to deal with the workers compensation file
9393456 todd and sarah are scratching their heads why on earth hasnt this why is this guy still representing the department
9393457 were seeing clues or signs that matters from his personal confidential file were being shared to generate talking points against the trooper as drums being pounded to get him dismissed
9393458 lugar was surprised that he was willing to craft such a serious bill without much potential for media attention
9393459 what lugars staff felt was that obama was more substantive than he expected
9393460 the nuclear proliferation trip with lugar got bidens attention biden is enough old school and hes been around the senate long enough that he can spot someone he needs to pay attention to
9393461 there are always a few members who talk because they like the sound of their voice they dont ask good questions and dont listen to what came before so they ask the same question obama always seemed to take a new tack
9393462 he is not the kind of guy who does the washington cocktail party circuit
9393463 biden likes the people who take seriously the institution of the senate and the way it works and who are serious about getting things done
9393464 i have sat with him as he chairs the senate foreign relations committee and been by his side on the campaign trail and i can tell you that joe biden gets it
9393465 he wants this with every dirty immoral shiftless unprincipled fiber of his being and through this has become a living pathetic abhorrent example of the damage to heart and soul such lust for personal gain can cause
9393466 the thing that really excited us was the fact that they are going to open source all of android
9393467 we think that will lead to a lot of innovation
9393468 we have no idea where people are going to take this
9393469 mobile application processors are hitting a spot where we can deliver the internet at very low power broadband wireless technologies are being deployed and the internet itself has reached a point where it is ubiquitous
9393470 the delivery of our second a380 aircraft will be pushed back by a few weeks
9393471 discussions are under way with airbus regarding the delivery date
9393472 you gain a whole bundle of legal rights once you check in
9393473 let us now compare and contrast the travellers rights before check in and after check in
9393474 before you check in an airline in australia has the right to reschedule the flight times and cancel flights without compensating you for the inconvenience and loss caused
9393475 provided the airline warns the traveller of the delay or cancellation before check in no compensation will be offered and none will be payable to the traveller for the delay rescheduling or cancellation of a scheduled flight if there is a significant change for which the airline is responsible a fare refund might be available instead of a rescheduled flight
9393476 the check in switches on the legal rights of the traveller after check in airlines bear greater responsibility compensation is available and it may be about to become more generous
9393477 early check in is recommended not only is it better for the peace of mind of the traveller but the earlier the check in the sooner that legal rights are available by early check in i mean well before the check in closure times for scheduled departure
9393478 airlines will often go beyond their legal obligations and provide compensation if requested there is now talk in australia of introducing something similar to the european standard of compensation which provides for meals drinks and accommodation for travellers
9393479 the european standard is mandatory under european union law where a flight is longer than 3500km and departs from an eu country or elsewhere if the airline is an eu airline
9393480 my experience is that if you ask for this kind of compensation for delays or cancellations in australia the airline will give it to you if compensation is requested after the flight has ended it will often be in the form of a money voucher
9393481 given that consumer affairs victoria and presumably consumer affairs or fair trading departments in other states will be supportive then my advice is that if the flight is delayed or cancelled after check in and if it is overnight then the travellers would be within their rights to ask the airline to put them up in a hotel if the airline refused the travellers would be within their rights to catch a taxi to their hotel of choice eat their evening meal of choice select a room of reasonable standard eat breakfast and claim full reimbursement from the airline no australian airline seems to have put the no compensation provisions of their conditions of carriage to the test in a tribunal or court of law in practice i suspect that if pressed the airlines just compensate quietly

9393485 i was able to fight through and that is the most important thing
9393486 im excited i love this crowd and i cant wait for the fourth round
9393487 we will use it primarily for catastrophic storms as a way to safely evacuate in phases to get the galveston county population ahead of the regional population
9393488 at least we know weve got something and thats better than nothing when it comes to an orderly evacuation of the region
9393489 if some decide they cant live without air conditioning and theyre not in the danger zone and dont want to take a chance we have no control over that
9393490 people were more nervous than they had ever been for a hurricane when they saw the same storm on the same track over the course of five days anxiety levels were very high

9393514 i was trying to get situated at home i was trying to get things so it would be halfway safe
9393515 youre torn do you leave it and worry about it or do you stay and worry about living
9393516 theres really no place to go all the hotels are booked up to little rock and beyond
9393517 if we flood again were goners i dont think were coming back
9393518 i think for people who havent left they really are die hards because theyre taking their lives in their hands
9393519 i cant see any reason why a person staring down the barrel of a category 3 or category 4 hurricane would want to see if they can try to outfox mother nature thats taking an awful risk with yourself and your family
9393520 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our back yard
9393521 there was a nice big kiss at the end with both hands on the cheeks
9393522 we are not advocates of sanctions and consider them to be a last resort
9393523 i have taken this decision and there is no turning back
9393524 i expect that europe will support our territorial integrity and will say that it will never recognise these illegal actions
9393525 i do not know for sure what will happen in brussels tomorrow but i know that it is the beginning of a major process russia today is more isolated than it ever was during the existence of the soviet union
9393526 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9393527 when a bear attacks a dwarf it should at least be known and said
9393528 we have no intention of limiting energy exports in any way we will abide strictly by our contractual obligations
9393529 but we are going to enlarge and diversify our export possibilities for these products which are so essential to the global economy
9393530 im not sure what sarah brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative
9393531 im offended by barack obama saying that about my husband
9393532 oh im sorry i was looking for the gm fan site this is obviously not it i seem to have stumbled on to a site for toyota lobbyists in washington dc even gms successes seem to be met here with jeers and condescention
9393533 oh im sorry i was looking for the gm fan site this is obviously not it i seem to have stumbled on to a site for toyota lobbyists in washington dc
9393534 who cares who owns an airline so long as it is safe and provides efficient service its time to move from the world of flags and politics to brands and business
9393535 under the mask of korean carrier tiger is attempting to get a free ride in the big northeast asian market of korea china and japan as singapores domestic market is very small its operation here will attack koreas aviation sovereignty if the government permits incheon tigers business similar cases will follow we hope the government will not approve the license and prevent the problem from getting worse
9393536 weve always stressed that people need to bring their own bedding
9393537 in a situation like a hurricane theres not time to bring hundreds of thousands of cots into one location
9393538 hopefully news coverage will be heavy and tell people when the roads are clear or when grocery stores are open
9393539 who knows the university of texas medical branch or mainland medical center might not be fully operational you have to gauge what there is to come back to like a worst case scenario but i certainly hope we dont see that
9393540 theres not much good in coming back in town if there is no electricity or no grocery stores to provide food after the storm makes landfall well determine how quickly to allow people back in
9393541 explorers dont leave fellow explorers lost we want to find out what happened to our friend and colleague no more and no less
9393542 while i feel hes under our nose here hes in an area thats extremely hard to get to its the vertical terrain its the dark terrain and its the trees the vegetation
9393543 if that aircraft didnt go straight down and kind of angled in under a stand of pine trees its going to take someone physically walking upon that scene to find it
9393544 its hard to believe in this day and age that someone could disappear like this until you go up in an aircraft and look at how rough the terrain is its absolutely amazing
9393545 if we dont find steve fossett people are going to be coming out here for the next 50 years until he is found
9393546 a window unit air conditioner or the size of a shopping cart or a washing machine it could just be scattered debris
9393547 when a bear attacks a dwarf it should at least be known and said
9393548 it seems that oil is more important than human rights and a states sovereignty
9393549 we are not advocates of sanctions and consider them to be a last resort
9393550 i have taken this decision and there is no turning back
9393551 in these international accords we will define our obligations to provide aid economic social humanitarian and military
9393552 russias military hostility against the small state of georgia could have a domino effect in other countries of the region like ukraine
9393553 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9393554 absolutely in accordance with international law in georgia and suggested that eu leaders pushing for tough measures were serving us interests
9393555 whatever happens and whatever is being said truth is on our side
9393556 we acted absolutely and morally in accordance with international law
9393557 if some european countries want to serve someone elses foreign policy interests then we cant stop them
9393558 insist on the respect of certain principles such as the principle of territorial integrity
9393559 we have already established that russia is a partner of europe that its role is important as such we have to find a substantial dialogue an equilibrium in our relations
9393560 let us not forget that russia urgently needs cooperation and integration with the rest of europe to secure a better future
9393561 they may have oil and gas but their investments in energy infrastructure are insufficient to satisfy internal and external demand in the coming years
9393562 stronger european and atlantic engagement with these two countries ukraine and georgia but also with the greater region between russia the european union and the southern caucasus would raise the cost of any aggressive move by russia in the coming years
9393563 it is also important to help all these states with their efforts at reform so they development into politically stable and economically successful societies that is also important to inspire russia
9393564 a deliberate violation of international law and basic principles for stability in europe
9393565 dramatically escalated the crisis between russia and the rest of the world
9393566 the heads of state agreed to pursue direct contacts in the near term including a possible meeting
9393567 give a man everything he wants and at that moment he will realise that everything is not everything
9393568 there is light at the end of the tunnel in that mortgage stress in australia may well have peaked
9393569 if the rbas monetary policy strategies are to be achieved its essential lenders mirror any decrease to the cash rate
9393570 on rumours or speculations regarding non official information of acquisitions sales associations or ventures
9393571 i have thrown my hat in the ring and they will say it is a good hat as it is an indian hat
9393572 one would expect bell and telus to want to be quite aggressive in being able to compete with rogers
9393573 fully absorbed by market demand system wide seat load factor for the period remained unchanged from 2007 at 78
9393574 the staff will continue to monitor the hurricane as it makes its direct track
9393575 we may be experiencing winds on tuesday but we dont even have voluntary evacuations called on the west end for tides
9393576 with the hurricane predicted to stall in east texas there could be significant rain events
9393577 they need to get home and not get caught in rain events
9393578 historically the economy seems to matter and given the state of the economy it should be giving obama an edge
9393579 the key economic variable that should be hurting the republicans
9393580 only the second time since world war ii that well be going into the election with real disposable income having fallen
9393581 we didnt get out last time and it was a mistake im not sure where were going but im happy to get out of here
9393582 during this most recent contest stephanie and i started off on different sides we would see each other and she would say to me this is what it means to be a friend and all i could say is i understand and that is a testimony to her and the kind of person she was
9393583 two leaders came together and they talked and she felt good about the conversation
9393584 theres a 6 year old who looks at me and says are you really the president and i said yes i am and he said youre not dead yet and well you know he thought the president was thomas jefferson a president was a dead white guy thanks to you senator no one will ever think that is the definition again
9393585 general mckiernan wants to ensure that the numbers can be reconciled somehow so its important that theres cooperation
9393586 its very surprising that the numbers are so disparate we believe that this could be because of some taliban propaganda or misinformation
9393587 we are hopeful that a collaborative inquiry will result in finding out the truth
9393588 but it needs to be broad based and it needs to include all the key players the afghans the u s military nato the united nations
9393589 i think that the main target was somewhere else and as the u s and afghan forces were passing by azizabad on the way to the target they came under attack
9393590 one of the american special forces soldiers was injured and then the special forces called for air support to bombard the village
9393591 i still dont know where the main target was supposed to be and neither does the commander of our commando unit
9393592 suddenly there were large planes above us then they bombed the house
9393593 they bombed and fired from 1 a m to 8 a m all of my relatives were killed in this bombing my cousins my uncles nieces nephews two of my daughters and my son
9393594 it was difficult for us to get to the bodies and to bury them we buried five children in one grave and four children in another grave
9393595 i would not come back except to get what i could salvage that would be enough for me
9393596 we wont stay and thats scary because new orleans would really be in trouble
9393597 i would not come back except to get what i could salvage that would be enough for me
9393598 its discrimination against the state of alaska during a time when gas prices are high and we need to look at all options to issue something that shuts off a viable resource
9393599 the amazing thing about this litigation is that the governor of alaska is so anti environmental that she is suing the bush administration over a claimed overabundance of protections for the polar bear
9393600 i think it shows the strength of our legal theory
9393601 basically we said list the polar bear and when you list the polar bear youre going to have to do something about greenhouse gas emissions the fact all these other parties are suing over it shows the bush administration doesnt have a legal leg to stand on they know the administration has to do something about greenhouse gas emissions
9393602 the process of inter country adoption in nepal has a lot of problems and loopholes and in many cases we can talk about some malpractices the best interest of the child is not the center piece of the current process and an important shift should be encouraged
9393603 the standards in the homes are really not up to minimum acceptable standards the majority have many many problems theres no professional people working in these centers the physical organization the fact that the children cannot leave the home they cannot freely move
9393604 the centers have the full control of the system the centers are the one who decide who are the abandoned who should leave for adoption for inter country adoption so where they make their money is through inter country adoption because parents in the outside are so eager to have children so people are ready to pay any amount an adoption law should absolutely stop this business
9393605 once they have seen the child most families they are hooked and the home has power over these parents because they want to have this child they can ask for more money how much is demanded is difficult to say 20 25 30 000
9393606 but nobody will really say how much it pays because they know its not really ethically correct
9393607 no im not surprised actually the contents of the report are not that surprising of course the report has revealed many things that need immediate improvement
9393608 it will help us reform the inter country adoption process and there to make good provisions regarding the rights of the child
9393609 it was 2 in the morning or so and it seemed like johns father had been sleeping before it happened
9393610 he got to the point pretty quickly after we got moving
9393611 captain mccain was upset but he didnt go on talking about it very long
9393612 he wanted to get home he just said no more of that the important thing was that we not jeopardize anything for ourselves
9393613 im afraid that we may have to look at that situation and well try to monitor it
9393614 but you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day
9393615 im sure that if governor haley barbour thought senator mccain and governor palins presence would in any way distract from the important work theyre doing in advance of the storm he wouldnt have invited them
9393616 they need to know and i know they know they are in our prayers
9393617 we need to be sensitive to this as we go forward
9393618 are making contingency plans should the president decide against traveling to minnesota
9393619 we continue to look at different security measures to protect customers sitekey is not a single solution but we do feel its a very good measure to put in place
9393620 im very surprised that phishing attacks are having so much success
9393621 if you recognize your sitekey image youll know for sure that you are at the valid bank of america site
9393622 confirming your sitekey image is also how youll know that its safe to enter your passcode
9393623 its a greater crime than just the money this is identity theft they have everything about me
9393624 on a scale of 1 to 10 sitekey is a 1 or a 2 and can be easily beaten and everyone knows it
9393625 it is now well established that prisoners can and do secrete mobile phones in body cavities
9393626 this is a fantastic opportunity for our members to access the full range of products and services available from brightstar and to maximise the benefits of working with one of the leading mobile distributors it will add even more value to their impda membership helping them to gain a competitive advantage over other dealers and to compete on a more level playing field with the major retailers we are looking forward to working with brightstar to ensure that our members can take full advantage of the potential it brings to them
9393627 we know that human rights are essential to peace yet too many people around the world still have their rights violated especially during and after armed conflict that is why we must ensure that the rights in the declaration are a living reality that they are known understood and enjoyed by everyone everywhere it is often those who most need their human rights protected who also need to be informed that the declaration exists and that it exists for them
9393628 on 21 september the international day of peace i call on world leaders and peoples around the world to join forces against conflict poverty and hunger and for all human rights for all
9393629 the launch of 3g services in latin america is the first step in the process of meeting the needs of our higher arpu customers for broadband services broadband is expected to be a significant growth segment in these markets and one which we expect will be an important driver to our businesses going forward
9393630 businesses especially those in the more advanced markets are investing in ip telephony solutions and upgrades that can be embedded or integrated with uc unified communications applications
9393631 tools such as presence unified messaging and peer to peer technologies that ride on ip systems have been some of the reasons for the early deployments and will likely continue to drive wider adoption of ip telephony
9393632 asia pacific has a very large amount of legacy tdm based infrastructure making it difficult and costly particularly for smbs small and medium businesses to upgrade or replace the existing systems
9393633 ip telephony deployment typically involves a greater amount of vendor services such as network assessment and network optimisation further slowing down the adoption curve
9393634 the anti drug fight in venezuela has shown significant progress during recent years especially since the government ended official cooperation programs with the dea
9393635 the essence of life is to draw your away games and win your home games
9393636 the essence of life is to draw your away games and win your home games so weve now got to sort out our home form
9393637 we tried a different system today and it seemed to benefit the players and simplify their game we have got a lot of players who are trying to find their sea legs we tried something that they seemed to have fitted into
9393638 we wont be able to play like that every week system wise but now we have got to get this team thinking about scoring goals we still havent scored a gaol in the last three or four games but today was a solid performance
9393639 it was very difficult to be forceful offensively because we have had to make ourselves stronger as a unit and they have had to be thinking about how they should play in the system and forget about having a shot at goal every now and again
9393640 i dont think we deserved any more than a point so ill take that were a team finding our feet at this minute in time its going to be a long hard slog to get ourselves the finished article and were not got to be that in one season
9393641 the positives considering we shipped a few goals earlier in the season it was another clean sheet
9393642 but i felt it was always going to be a clean sheet i certainly cant recall in open play that they had a chance or a real goalscoring opportunity whereas i felt we created a number of chances certainly in the first half in particular
9393643 plymouth paid us a lot of respect by coming and getting everybody behind the ball and not giving up a lot of space and thats when the players have got to keep passing and moving until that opportunity arises
9393644 when we did that in the first half then we had chances and i felt we offered enough to the match to get the three points
9393645 overall were certainly disappointed not to get the three points weve got quality and boys that can score goals they just have to stay true to themselves and to their beliefs and that will turn for them
9393646 but the most important thing is if we continue getting clean sheets then youll win your share of games no doubt about that
9393647 i never saw anything of the sending off and thats not me being evasive
9393648 the linesman was certainly convinced though and when i watch the dvd if he has done anything wrong then hell be punished in no uncertain terms because we want the discipline to be bang on and were certainly not going to stand for that
9393649 we know hes a young lad but hes left his team mates playing with ten men and we could have paid a price for that hes going to be missing for a number of games now so hes hurting individually but bigger than that hes hurting the football club and i wont stand for that
9393650 one of the real positives of this year is we have finished with nobody who probably wouldnt be able to play next week
9393651 in terms of the health of our list as a whole we have a pretty healthy list going forward and that is a reasonable foundation for the next campaign
9393652 everybody should be ready when pre season starts in a couple of months
9393653 weve got 46 players on our list and we wont have 46 players in a months time
9393654 the 2008 season again affirms the afl as the no 1 spectator sport in australia when combined with the fact that our clubs built a record tally of 574 091 club members for the premiership season
9393655 this was an outstanding result considering the impact of the olympics in the latter part of the season which had an effect on three weeks of our year and our commitment to play matches in darwin carrara launceston and canberra with limited capacity
9393656 there is technology that is 100 per cent conclusive 100 per cent of the time
9393657 video review in the pre season would slow down the game and was not always conclusive
9393658 were not sure there is technology that can be always conclusive
9393659 any extra information you can give umpires to make the correct decision i dont have a problem with
9393660 the way we have gone about giving the young guys experience and asking them to carry the workload and getting the older guys to play different roles will continue
9393661 we have to do that it is imperative that the match committee holds its nerve on that because of this opportunity for the playing group we want to do well but on top of that what it can give to us long term is too important not to persist with youth in key roles
9393662 last year we were more anxious id say they are very hungry to achieve
9393663 i thought we were outstanding in the second third and fourth quarters it is exactly the sort of game you want coming in to the finals
9393664 weve been up for a few weeks now and then i just thought we looked pretty flat
9393665 operation nareeba has shown there is no doubt that alcohol and drug related crime is a problem
9393666 i think we have shown in the past 48 hours we can make a difference i am pretty sick of hearing serious assaults virtually every weekend in the city
9393667 hey hassidic jews of williamsburg ill bring home the bacon
9393668 hi im ed towns and i believe in a while my opponent believes in a which is wrong thank you
9393669 i arrived in new delhi an illiterate boy but i was free
9393670 the untouchable has been touched by indias growth dalits are coming out from hunger and humiliation
9393671 ive had enough kidnapping corrupt police a rotten judicial system
9393672 were desperate weve been fighting for five years we want an answer
9393673 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9393674 this night of witness is extremely important for we muslims it is the night that unifies us all
9393675 its kind of a shock i think shes in a little over her head
9393676 but i think of anybody shes the kind of person who can rise to an occasion
9393677 she handles tough questions well its hard to get elected to be a woman and get elected in alaska
9393678 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9393679 i think john mccain won the state of alaska but lost the nation
9393680 i think her inexperience is going to cause many many voters to think twice before voting for him
9393681 wootens words were i will kill him hell eat a expletive lead bullet ill shoot him if our father got the attorney to help molly
9393682 i heard this death threat my 16 year old son heard it track palin molly heard it as did their small children wooten spoke with his trooper gun on his hip in an extremely intimidating fashion leaving no doubt he is serious about taking someones life who disagrees with him
9393683 my concern is that the publics faith in the troopers will continue to diminish as more residents express concerns regarding the apparent lack of action towards a trooper whom is described by many as a ticking time bomb and a loose cannon
9393684 wooten is my brother in law but this information is forwarded to you objectively
9393685 in the united states we simply have not figured out how to fit the pieces together for a coordinated package that puts people on bikes
9393686 the firefly populations have dropped 70 percent in the past three years
9393687 when you talk to old people about fireflies it is always the same
9393688 they saw so many when they were young and now they are lucky now if they see one
9393689 legislative accomplishments are few and far between because he cannot work well and bring people together and persuade them of a positive issue
9393690 its a lot closer to a revolution than to a routine day at the office
9393691 the republicans are about to nominate the only person in our party distinct enough from the rest to have a chance of winning in what ought to be a very bad year he is our most different candidate since teddy roosevelt
9393692 the overwhelming evidence that climate change is taking place argues that we address the issue
9393693 really focuses on government spending it would be a radical change for washington d c
9393694 hes taking sides in an internal republican fight between the appropriators who always want to spend more and the rest of the party i think he can win it because despite the cacophony of special interest protests hell have popular support
9393695 i remember him talking about her when he came back
9393696 he said she was an impressive woman he liked her
9393697 he was down to the point that if the meeting had gone well and it was expected to go well there was going to be an offer
9393698 i dont think he would have invited her if it werent his intention to offer her the job
9393699 nobody was vetted less or more than anyone in the final stages and john had access to all that information and made the decision
9393700 after a certain point though mother natures going to have her say
9393701 when we take a hit like this it not only affects the growers but it can trickle through the entire sugar economy
9393702 one of the things we found out after katrina and rita was that the plants came back faster than the surrounding communities
9393703 where the workers are and getting them back is going to be tricky thing
9393704 its awful when youre in one but the fact is the u s economy is so big that these things just dont matter that much economically
9393705 katrina was a real mess and caused something like 25 billion in damage but if you lose 20 billion or 25 billion in the context of a 10 trillion economy its not really a very big deal
9393706 how many times are the other 49 states going to be willing
9393707 there was talk the first time around about whether it was worth it those kinds of comments might be better received this time
9393708 important for elplaylist the cover path is set in a variable handled by elplaylist art path by default its setted to folder jpg in songs directory gt go to elplaylist settings rigth click on it gt settings tab genral and just double click on the var name to update the path used
9393709 kids even when theyre sick are resilient theyre upbeat and hopeful and we wanted to give them that kind of environment
9393710 we have developed the pool and sports zone and the vitality at sea spa and fitness centre to give our guests even more choices on a unique and memorable royal caribbean cruise
9393711 the fact that fewer travellers are booking online is not due to economic concerns online travel bookers are an affluent demographic it is caused by frustrations related to the planning and booking capabilities of online travel agencies
9393712 this in turn is spurring a renewed appreciation for the expertise and personalized services offered by traditional travel agents
9393713 not so long ago industry observers cast traditional travel agents as has beens
9393714 perhaps this has helped them to focus on what they do best provide travel expertise and personalized service
9393715 mired in old technology the otas have failed to keep pace with a newer and more innovative breed of travel websites built around user generated content
9393716 in addition a new breed of matchmaking travel sites is bringing traditional travel agency talent online
9393717 sites like zicasso and tripology help travellers to exotic locales find travel agents tailored to their interests and needs
9393718 i dont think it will be overnight i think it will happen incrementally
9393719 our job until we leave whenever that is is to continue training the iraqi police training the iraqi army giving them advice and continuing to be a force for stability
9393720 there are things here that i can do without for sure things that we brought here in the bad old days that i simply dont need anymore
9393721 everyone here is working 15 to 20 hours a day
9393722 that is in the marine dna to be in a real fight but this is the toughest part of what we have been doing here putting the plug in the insurgency its very intellectual and requires a tremendous amount of patience
9393723 its taken a long time to get to this point and certainly mistakes were made on the ground in anbar
9393724 things were done that perhaps in retrospect alienated people and caused them to move against us
9393725 we do have extensive plans to respond wherever the storm is going to go
9393726 the intersection of invention and insight leading to the creation of social and economic value
9393727 the development of new ideas and their economic application as new products or processes
9393728 though the outcomes of successful innovations appear random the processes that result in their success often are not
9393729 he who innovates will have for his enemies all those who are well off under the existing order of things and only lukewarm supporters in those who might be better off under the new
9393730 the true pacemakers of socialism were not the intellectuals or agitators who preached it but the vanderbilts carnegies and rockefellers
9393731 our form going into the finals hasnt been as good as in previous seasons but in saying that we know what is expected to win finals games
9393732 are we playing at our best at the moment probably not but it gave us a really good indication on the weekend that we have improved and we have ticked off a few boxes that have been an issue over the past month
9393733 the most pleasing thing was just our pressure and the way we attacked the ball
9393734 it was a bit of a slippery night and at stages our skills were poor but it was probably that real intent to put pressure on the opposition that was the best thing to come out of the game and something we can continue going into next week we know that under finals pressure that is what really stands up
9393735 the leaders discussed the importance of supporting georgias territorial integrity and the need for russia to comply with all elements of the ceasefire agreement and withdraw its troops from georgia in accordance with that agreement
9393736 also major problems into the future we have numbers of volunteers decreasing people are moving into urban interface areas which is a lot riskier
9393737 i hope and pray we will be able to resume some of our normal operations as quickly as possible
9393738 were going to suspend most of our activities tomorrow except for those absolutely necessary
9393739 i hope and pray we will be able to resume some of our normal operations as quickly as possible but some of that is frankly in the hands of god
9393740 take off our republican hats and put on our american hats and we say america were with you
9393741 we will refrain from any political rhetoric which would be traditional in an opening session
9393742 right now we have a horrible storm bearing down on the gulf people should be more concerned about that than a political campaign and that is the way we are going to let the chips fall
9393743 we can activate an email list of a couple million people who want to give back
9393744 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary

9393766 i have seen how militarism has failed to address the armed conflict now raging again in southern philippines
9393767 and i have noted how prejudice and our lack of understanding about islam have helped separate us from our muslim brothers and sisters
9393768 besides the war itself which made both christian and muslim villagers internal refugees i came face to face with the prejudice against our muslim brothers and sisters during the governments relief and rehabilitation operation
9393769 and a muslim elder told me what can we do with these medicines when we havent eaten for three days i became saddened at government personnel distributing rice and other food items because i learned that only christian evacuees were given food
9393770 asking the lord what i can do to serve our muslim brothers and sisters and help bring peace
9393771 at first the muslim villagers were wary of our motives but we finally earned their trust in fact kamlun moner the village sultan proclaimed that he and his fellow villagers had become born again muslims who have renounced rebellion
9393772 the continuing conflict in southern philippines is deep seated there is prejudice and a lack of understanding of each others faiths
9393773 by growing in our understanding we hope to outgrow our own prejudices and from there we hope to march towards peace
9393774 miley cyrus nude scene rumor fits with profit driven sexuality push
9393775 nearly a quarter of readers support nude scenes for 12 year olds
9393776 the viewers and purveyors of that site are disgusting pedophiles
9393777 we have had a whole bunch of australians but all of the tourists have left
9393778 all of the hotels have closed its against the law to stay open the tourists either left via the airport or been bused out
9393779 i am not being a daredevil and i feel very calm and well looked after with police making multiple patrols checking on the welfare of people around town
9393780 this is the mother of all storms and im not sure weve seen anything like it
9393781 this is the real deal this is not a test
9393782 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9393783 consult our travel advice and consult the us hurricane centre warnings but most importantly follow advice of local authorities
9393784 as we understand it there are 12 parishes or local areas in louisiana recommending or requiring evacuation
9393785 new orleans is called the big easy because it used to be very cheap and easy to live here but not anymore
9393786 people are terrified because theyre saying it will be worse than katrina were just praying the town gets saved
9393787 quite honestly i dont think people have it in them to rebuild again
9393788 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9393789 integrated to such an extent that you dont hear about them theyre doing what we would look upon as normal jobs living normal australian lives
9393790 were not living normal lives were totally over represented in the social indicators were dying a lot younger we dont have the education opportunities people are living below the poverty line in many parts of australia it is not just those in northern australia who are battling to make ends meet
9393791 it really denies the uniqueness of who the indigenous people are and what their contribution to this country can be in their own right as if they have nothing to contribute except the absorption of the culture that the west has offered to us its a pretty damnable statement if thats the case
9393792 it really promotes the urban remote divide and that is really quite wrong
9393793 im just disappointed that he should go out on a note like that when we know theres been a lot of emphasis on remote areas and the difficulties there but there are huge huge difficulties in urban australia and we need to bridge that gap
9393794 sufficiently to demonstrate their relation to the prosecution of the petition

9393814 the adult was probably the same one seen last month off dana point
9393815 but this is the first time weve seen the calf and the calf was swimming with an adult of normal pigmentation
9393816 the adult dolphin was about 95 percent white and had some dark dalmation like marks
9393817 the calf wasnt quite as white which isnt unsual theyre pattern doesnt fully develop until later in life
9393818 we could clearly see both white dolphins they came within 10 feet of the boat and the calf did some bow riding

9393825 we have got tons of data but we want information

9393827 if you re willing to drive around 200 miles along dirt roads and find something that s definitely crumbled you re definitely part of the breed
9393828 tremendous effort on our teams part to bounce back from a rough game on friday night
9393829 we played a team that was rested in ball state so the energy it took to come up with a win after being down at the half shows tremendous spirit by the part of these players
9393830 we were putting ourselves in position to score goals and were just being lazy mentally
9393831 i told them to make runs down the line and then penetrate in behind its easy to fix offsides and we made the adjustments
9393832 first middle aged woman with a lot of children and no experience selected as vp running mate
9393833 he has been a bit disappointing a couple of times but he was on is a game tonight

9393838 you either do it and go on with your life or you dont and you risk the possibility of dying
9393839 some women say i cant live with the anxiety of having this happen again
9393840 fewer women are choosing to have just one breast removed
9393841 but if they believe its going to improve their survival rate then weve got a problem
9393842 its just terrible that thats the position women are in after spending billions of dollars on research and on awareness and on building cancer centers and treatment centers around the country and thats still the choice we give women cut off healthy breasts
9393843 without clothes it doesnt really look like a breast it doesnt feel like a breast and it certainly doesnt have much of the sensation of the breast
9393844 i read these things about people whose whole life seems to hang on having breasts
9393845 player enthusiasm continues to exceed our expectations at every milestone and we are very excited to enter this stage of our beta program and take the next major step toward our launch

9393847 this is the first production the ukiah players theater has done all kids
9393848 took a long time to get done so were not exactly jumping up to get back in the studio and work
9393849 were trying to figure out what the next step is to be honest with you
9393850 is not necessarily a bad thing trust me weve been ripped off by every label there ever was
9393851 is basically us interpreting classic disney stuff in our inimitable way
9393852 i guess they ask walt when he blinks it comes out
9393853 that one remains a favorite it was a great time when you could make a strange record like that and have it well received things werent as well defined in terms of marketing radio hadnt turned into the wasteland it is now
9393854 i think the records wouldnt be as interesting if we agreed on everything a lot of it has to do with sparks that fly and how we move our pretty democratic organization how the various schools of thought get satisfied or ignored
9393855 the good news is were the only ones weve ever had to make happy
9393856 nobodys ever ordered us to do a song with christina aguilera or anything
9393857 lobos still takes precedence over anything else everybody in the band knows were not like some bands where you never really know what the agenda is whether someones just there for the ride or for the long haul lobos happens and everything else happens around it
9393858 the louisiana national guard is fully prepared for a hurricane disaster and has improved reaction times communication and equipment resources by learning from hurricanes katrina and rita

9393874 how on earth could 4 time cancer survivor john mccain have so little judgment as to think even for a split second that this woman was qualified to be a heatbeat away from being americas president
9393875 the complete idiots guide to the last days an apocalyptic look at the future
9393876 what a woman should look like when she is pregnant
9393877 when asked why the staffs of the entire department of justice health amp human services education and noaa were replaced with graduates of liberty university vice president palin said
9393878 if the conservative governor of a state had a teenage daughter who got pregnant and tried to cover it up as her own
9393879 would i have gotten on a plane for an 8 hour flight after my water broke especially if it was a high risk pregnancy
9393880 get out of my way old man this is my moment to shine
9393881 democrats are attacking the sanctity of motherhood have they at last no decency
9393882 woman delivers in the fields and goes right back to work
9393883 something to take care of after tomorrows 8 hour flight
9393884 would i have gotten on a plane for an 8 hour flight after my water broke especially if it was a high risk pregnancy
9393885 apparently governor palins daughter was out of high school for five months with mono right about the time the baby was born
9393886 oh poor girl that must have been a bad case oh my god thats her baby i thought she was holding it in a motherly way in that picture they had on the news
9393887 and for heavens sake if we go after palins daughter were going to look like rush limbaugh insulting chelsea clinton actually it could be much worse what if god forbid the girl got pregnant through a rape and palin decided to pretend the baby was hers to protect her daughter from scrutiny how awful do you want to be to this poor girl i strongly suggest that we leave it alone
9393888 there have been many advances even in districts which two or three years ago were in total backwardness
9393889 mr president the population of muanza doesnt need this administrator here he doesnt coordinate his activities with the population
9393890 only goes to the friends of the administrator and to the members of the district consultative council and their relatives

9393896 for the european market we will release it as soon as possible after japan we are planning it for the us but the launch timing is not decided
9393897 in the future we would like to create new applications using this feature
9393898 the use of games or gaming dynamics not simply to entertain the player but rather to inspire a particular action effect some type of attitudinal behavioural change or instill a particular lesson in the service of an organisational goal
9393899 this is really a story of hitting this younger generation of workers where it lives as well as speaking to some of the issues like the desire of workers to bring personal technology to the workplace and the need to be more environmentally and cost conscious in it decisions
9393900 for those deploying games deciding whether their target audience internalised the lesson instead of just becoming good at playing the game is paramount
9393901 proving the efficacy of a game for a particular business depends on the goal of the game for something as straightforward as training it is important to tie the goals of the game to a particular outcome
9393902 alex does not work for the council he just had a contract to provide services in the councils marketing and image office in 2006 after that every now and then he has given us support with photographs we cant even talk of a wage because he was paid by piece for the work he did when asked
9393903 since he always identified himself as a mozambican and told us he came from inhassunge in zambezia province the documents he showed us also said that
9393904 if i won it would fulfill a lifelong dream ive wanted to be a performer and to be at the air canada centre would be amazing

9393911 you can rebuild or move but you cant replace a life thats what it basically boils down to
9393912 anxiety youre anxious worried all of those things you cant sleep you end up just staying up for two or three days until the storm is passed you really dont sleep until its done and you can start picking up the pieces
9393913 katrina was in 2005 and were still rebuilding now in 2008 with gustav hitting in 2008 it could be 2010 or 2012
9393914 we need a prayer right now for the simple fact that there are a lot of people going all different ways families are being dispersed all over the state

9393917 indians who travel abroad are the top of the pyramid this group of travellers are not impacted by inflation or increase in air fares as they have high disposable income
9393918 though an exact fix on spend for this year is not available indians for sure havent reduced their spend either on shopping or f amp b the great singapore sale was a big hit among indians
9393919 since most indians travel with their families the average expenditure is significantly higher compared to inbound tourists from other countries
9393920 our analysis indicates that indians not only spend on shopping but they experiment with cuisine too indian travellers are also upgrading to four and five star hotels paying more than 100 per night
9393921 agreement looks unlikely this week the red lines of india and concerned nsg members remain too far apart
9393922 89 000 electric bikes were sold in the netherlands last year while 60 000 power assisted bikes were sold in germany in china they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
9393923 the fly is an extraordinary example of cronenbergs particular brand of
9393924 they dont support him they worship him thats scary and wrong
9393925 when we proclaimed our independence we had to start everything from scratch
9393926 we also had to build hospitals roads railways like the one being built here in muanza

9393936 i do not care whether or not this forum has loads of funky new features if no one can get to the site and or post anything whats the point
9393937 i would also like to register my disgust at whats been happening for several days and my sheer disappointment that oracle of all companies would allow an application to go live without thorough testing or if it was thoroughly tested in uat without rolling back immediately when it was obvious that there were problems in the production environment
9393938 uptime is still not where it should be of course forums oracle com is business critical for a lot of folks as well as for oracle and im glad they consider it so
9393939 we made a conscious decision early in this process to stick with the upgrade to fight through the problems instead of run from them
9393940 regardless i do want to apologize for the downtime youve suffered through thus far
9393941 we are going to suspend most of our activities tomorrow except for those absolutely necessary
9393942 whos that is this a joke whos that again she has a four month old baby and shes hitting the campaign trail is she breastfeeding

9393945 rage propelled me to the most furious workout ive had in a while
9393946 the university has completely disregarded the concerns about anybody who cares about full and equal rights for women who cares about the intellectual quality of feminist debate and who cares about womens desire to enter the work force
9393947 ma ma wheres my pa gone to the white house ha ha ha
9393948 sign on young man and sail with me the stature of our homeland is no more than the measure of ourselves our job is to keep her free our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all to this solemn purpose we call on the young the brave the strong and the free heed my call come to the sea come sail with me
9393949 pardon him theodotus he is a barbarian and thinks that the customs of his tribe and island are the laws of nature
9393950 and those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music
9393951 a kind providence has placed in our breasts a hatred of the unjust and cruel in order that we may preserve ourselves from cruelty and injustice
9393952 yes of course you are now we got to buckle down and save planet express

9393954 yes of course you are now we got to buckle down and save planet express
9393955 its been three years and new orleans is not all the way back together if another hurricane comes it will just be even longer for new orleans to get back
9393956 we dont need another storm putting more people out of their home again and leaving them to start from the beginning ive been through that
9393957 i had the mentality in new orleans that a hurricane would come there because it hadnt come in years
9393958 now that ive been through it if they say leave ill leave i have a baby now i dont know where id go but im going
9393959 i dont want to see this city get another one
9393960 we wouldve never thought that we could possibly be facing another katrina in our lifetime even if it doesnt come the frenzy of it all its crazy my home may never be the same again
9393961 doug said lets go up to chattanooga and look for a house
9393962 so we would have a safe place for the children to come should they have to evacuate
9393963 i love this city but we cant keep going through this
9393964 after this time im going to really be done with it
9393965 regrettably the events recorded in relation to the present matters indicate that mr robson had a wilful disregard for the law society and its duty to investigate complaints
9393966 the tribunal were also concerned by his cavalier attitude towards the law society and his disrespect for authority and susceptibility to improper influences it was with this background that the tribunal has directed a restriction on his practising certificate
9393967 he would be expected to demonstrate he has a maturity and responsibility such as is expected of a principal solicitor in private practice
9393968 only thus can the public and the profession be duly protected
9393969 had many years experience in practice and must have been fully aware of his professional responsibilities whatever the cause of that conduct and however remarkable he was either unwilling or unable to discharge fundamental aspects of his professional duties
9393970 singulair is a really effective drug that has been on the market 10 years and has been taken by millions of patients
9393971 in over 40 placebo controlled trials no reports of suicide in singulair treated groups have been found
9393972 the evidence is good but we couldnt call it perfect
9393973 when you dont know what to look for its pretty sad
9393974 he began talking about losing the desire to practice medicine even though it was a great passion of his
9393975 for a guy who was such a family man to do that in a way that would basically ensure his family would be the first to find him was completely baffling
9393976 neurontin is an important medicine that has helped millions of patients with serious conditions

9394036 the three fans equipping it perform well they could have been spinning a bit faster but noise would have increased they are incredibly quiet at their speed and they still beat a faster fan setup like in the thermaltake xaser vi vh9000bws but there is also a small problem having a third fan on the side this one leaves little room for larger heatsinks such as my xigmatek hdt s1283 cpu cooler i have to force a bit to get the panel closed therefore pushing on the motherboard however if you plan on watercooling you wont have any problems the guardian 921 even allows you to pass tubing to an external radiator by two holes at the back especially made for that purpose moreover a great feature which adds to both watercooling and air cooling setups is the temperature reader with three probes you can stay aware of any temperatures simply by looking at the lcd in front of the case

9394048 i have a better idea now of what i want to do outside of football
9394049 im more well rounded i feel like i have more control over my life and what i spend my time doing
9394050 when i first got here he was a guy who would handle his business on the field but really didnt say too much
9394051 nowadays hes very vibrant in the locker room and talking to everybody hes still got his quiet side but its not like he used to be hes more energetic you can tell hes really happy to be playing now
9394052 i was just going to school there and had a regular life
9394053 nobody knew who i was the first couple months i was just enjoying friends i had in the neighborhood paying bills going to the grocery store and doing the simple things that arent so simple now
9394054 if i had to pick a moment when i turned a corner its when i retired pretty much before that my life was just going in a straight line i didnt feel like i really had control over what was happening i was just a football player thats all i ever knew when i retired the whole story had to be re written thats when everything became really fun
9394055 we had to look at it as a blank piece of paper and see where we were
9394056 hes made every workout and done extra in some of those situations hes been to every meeting and off season ota practice all i have to go on is what ive seen since ive been here the guys been really accountable
9394057 i would tell them if its meant for me to not let you down i wont let you down but if its meant for me to do something else then im sorry youre going to be let down
9394058 thats one thing ive tried to impress upon my kids life is not always going to be perfect youre going to be let down by even me sometimes you just have to try and understand and move on
9394059 by coming back and playing and leaving in a way that feels better to people there are positive associations
9394060 i dont feel im carrying that baggage for the rest of my life
9394061 as football players weve all had experiences that you dont want to repeat or look back on too much
9394062 i think it was helpful thats whats made him into what he is now the things you go through make you stronger as an individual
9394063 the way i look at it the people who have misconceptions about me have misconceptions about themselves
9394064 people who have had the experience ive had and been stuck there had to be some sort of crisis to break them out of the situation we all go through similar experiences but we all handle them a little differently
9394065 for me its definitely been a ride and its been wild but at the same time its been fun i always used to feel like i was trapped as a football player and there were things i would never be able to do in this lifetime ive had a chance to do 85 90 percent of those things and im still a football player

9394080 but mccain palin and their supporters will still have to compete for attention this week with a reminder of one of the reasons why americans have soured on republican rule
9394081 you know paul wellstone would welcome the republicans but he would also insist on exercising his amendment right to call attention to the failure of their philosophy the philosophy of only worry about yourself the market solves all problems government is bad paul would be talking about how over the last eight years these republican politicians have tried their ideas and failed paul would be talking about how instead of trying to fix public education they want you to have a voucher instead of fixing social security they want our seniors to have private accounts instead of fixing healthcare they want you to accept private healthcare accounts they dont want to solve the big problems of society they just want to leave you on your own paul would be saying that this approach has failed the nation but he would also have a positive message and it would be that we are all better off when we look out for each other thats the twin cities way thats the message john mccain will hear if he gets out of the convention hall

9394086 no intelligent person believes as mccain and company claim that palin was the best choice available why should we believe them now
9394087 palin wasnt the best choice available but she was the best fit for mccain and women and conservatives

9394133 shares in fannie mae and freddie mac fell on friday amid concerns foreign investors were reassessing their exposure to the troubled us mortgage financiers bonds and guaranteed securities
9394134 bank of china this week revealed it had cut its portfolio of securities issued or guaranteed by the two government sponsored enterprises by a quarter or 4 6 billion since the end of june the sale underscored signs of nervousness among foreign buyers of fannie and freddies debt
9394135 federal reserve custody data on thursday showed foreign official and private investors reduced their holdings of agency debt for the sixth consecutive week
9394136 bill odonnell analyst at ubs said if this recent theme of cooling passions for gses debt becomes a longer term trend then it could be problematic for the gses given that the central banks have taken roughly 30 to 60 of new gse issuance in recent months and years
9394137 the us treasury was granted powers last month to extend its credit lines to fannie and freddie and to invest in their debt and equity
9394138 for fannie may and freddie mac the game is over the sage of omaha has spoken
9394139 warren buffett the worlds richest man said it was no longer feasible for americas two biggest mortgage finance companies to exist independently he went on to forecast that the us economy would remain in the doldrums for at least five months
9394140 fannie and freddie which underpin americas mortgage market by buying home loans and packaging them into bonds did not have any net worth mr buffett told cnbc
9394141 mr buffett was also downbeat about the housing market and in turn the broader economy
9394142 mr buffett who runs the berkshire hathaway investment group from its headquarters in omaha nebraska added you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
9394143 mr buffett said he expected more banks to fail especially in areas where there was a housing bubble we will see failures where the bankers were dumb in what they did he said
9394144 more than a year into the credit crisis the worlds top central bankers admit they are still in the dark as to what its ultimate impact on the global economy will be
9394145 by the same token they are unsure to what extent weakening growth will help to ease high inflation
9394146 there is enormous uncertainty about where we stand at the moment stanley fischer governor of the bank of israel said at the close of the federal reserves annual retreat in jackson hole wyoming
9394147 his comments came as us treasury officials worked through the weekend on options for fannie mae and freddie mac the troubled mortgage groups amid expectations an announcement could come this week
9394148 mr fischer told central bankers from 43 nations we are in the midst of the worst financial crisis since world war ii but it was still not clear how big an event it would turn out to be
9394149 so far he said in real economy terms we are not looking at anything exceptional but the crisis was entering a second round in which economic and financial weakness could feed on each other
9394150 other current and former central bankers shared this view alan blinder a former fed vice chairman said it is amazing a year later how much is still unresolved
9394151 monetary policymakers appear torn between hope that the global economy is turning out to be resilient in part thanks to policy interventions and fear that the worst could lie ahead
9394152 they think the economy will muddle through and recover next year but they cannot rule out the possibility that the financial crisis in conjunction with the oil shock could deliver a bad economic outcome
9394153 my invitation to hob nob with the worlds monetary muckety mucks in jackson hole this weekend got lost in the mail yet again
9394154 too bad they are little more than corks tossed on violent seas of global forces totally beyond their control
9394155 thats something that the crowd in jackson hole can scarcely control so they might as well enjoy themselves on their junket
9394156 us and european banks already burdened by losses and concerns about their financial health face a new challenge paying off hundreds of billions of dollars of debt coming due
9394157 at issue are so called floating rate notes securities used heavily by banks in 2006 to borrow money
9394158 the crunch will begin next month when some 95 billion in floating rate notes mature
9394159 the problem highlights how the pain of the credit crunch now entering its second year wont end soon for banks or the broader economy
9394160 as banks scramble to pay the floating rate notes they could see profit margins shrink as wary investors demand higher interest rates for new borrowings theyre also likely to become less willing to make new loans to consumers and companies aggravating economic downturns in both the us and europe
9394161 the credit crunch is entering a second post subprime phase where banks loan books deteriorate more rapidly and capital raising efforts might become harder says scott bugie credit analyst at standard amp poors
9394162 loan book deterioration is starting to hit a wider array of financial institutions as credit losses migrate from subprime into other sectors of household finance such as credit cards alt a and prime mortgages and auto loans well into 2009 he says
9394163 mr bugie believes losses on the loan books of us banks could reach 265 billion a year for the next two to three years in europe he says the focus of concern is shifting to commercial loans as european economies enter a downturn
9394164 while capital raising has largely offset losses that financial institutions have incurred from writedowns much of the capital raised has been in the form of hybrid securities with both debt and equity characteristics he says
9394165 consequently the quality of the banks capital has eroded somewhat
9394166 and he warns that in the us and europe a major concern is regional banks ability to raise capital
9394167 the main message from the minutes of the august 5 fomc meeting is that the fed is on hold for several meetings barring unexpected developments
9394168 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability due to the effects of financial market strains as well as macroeconomic risks
9394169 brilliant bloomberg columnist caroline baum probably knows the bond market better than anyone else i know
9394170 whats going on one school holds that bonds are mispriced buyers are either complacent or smoking something stronger than tobacco even if they are in full command of their faculties they are choosing liquidity over yield
9394171 remember years ago i said that the big problem coming up would be income everybodys going to need income and income will be hard to come by im still of that same opinion my dear subscribers hunker down theres a hard rain acomin were heading into de leveraging and deflation and nobodys positioned for it
9394172 harvard university economist martin feldstein a member of the committee that charts american business cycles said the federal reserve cannot count on low interest rates to buoy economic growth
9394173 lower interest rates are not going to get us anything more said feldstein who retired in june as president of the national bureau of economic research
9394174 did we really need a 0 7 mom decline in the index of leading indicators for july to tell us that the us economy is in recession the unemployment queue is now the longest since december 2001 according to the weekly claims data housing starts look to be closing in on 900 000 in the next couple of months and even that is so far above demand that there is no dent in months supply on the horizon any wonder that the 10 year note now has a firm grip on the 3 handle and the equity market has not boasted four straight up days since last may
9394175 the us economy grew at an annual rate of 3
9394176 the upward revision of government expenditures 3 9 vs 3 4 was another category accounting for the upward revision of gdp growth in second quarter other minor upward revisions included a 1 7 gain in consumer spending vs a 1 5 increase and a 3 2 drop in capital spending vs a 3 4 drop in the advance estimate offsetting these upward revisions were downward revisions of expenditures on structures and residential investment expenditures
9394177 massive policy easing and fiscal stimulus have not been sufficient to offset the drags from a housing bust and squeeze on consumption
9394178 the conference boards us leading economic indicator lei fell again in july providing a fresh reminder that the slowdown is far from over a domestic recession is underway and policy efforts to stimulate growth have been short circuited by a collapse of risk taking in the financial markets
9394179 mortgage rates rose as policy rates declined underscoring that the housing slump will persist rumors that the treasury department may have to absorb the two large gses are proliferating underscoring the seriousness of the banking and financial crisis please see the next insight
9394180 bottom line the economy will remain weak for the foreseeable future implying persistently low treasury yields and further struggles for the equity market
9394181 nominal consumer spending increased 0 2 in july following a 0 6 gain in june however inflation adjusted consumer spending fell 0 4 in july after a 0 1 decline in june consumer spending will have to advance in leaps and bounds in august and september for a flat reading in the third quarter in other words a decline in third quarter consumer spending is nearly certain assuming our forecast is accurate this would be the first quarterly decline in consumer spending since fourth quarter of 1991
9394182 us core durable goods orders rose further in july underscoring that business investment has held up well in face of a domestic recession and tight credit conditions however risks remain to the downside
9394183 investment spending has been a relative bright light for the us economy mainly because a weak dollar has allowed us companies to gain global market share and overseas demand has been resilient
9394184 nevertheless our investment spending model forecasts that capex growth will drop to zero by the end of the year sticky corporate bond yields and a further slowing in final demand at home and abroad will cause companies to defer expansion plans expect more weakness ahead
9394185 durable goods orders beat expectations with a 1 3 month on month increase in july but the apparent strength is due to higher prices not stronger activity in fact deflating orders by the producer price index for durable manufactured goods shows a 9 4 year on year drop in real orders the worst since early 2002 even if we adjust for the unfavorable year on year comparisons that partly explain this plunge the recent data look surprisingly similar to those seen in the run up to the 2001 recession
9394186 the price to rent ratio of homes is a useful measure to put home price trends in a big picture framework
9394187 the price to rent ratio used here is computed from the national case shiller home price index and owners equivalent rent of the consumer price index
9394188 compared with these numbers the 125 4 price to rent ratio in the second quarter of 2008 is still at an elevated level it appears that home prices have a long march ahead when compared with the mean 109 6 and median 102 5 price to rent ratio for the period 1987 2008 q2 also
9394189 if history is any guide the price to rent ratio suggest that the bottom of home prices is not here yet
9394190 both the national association of realtors and the case shiller index confirm that us house prices continue to fall sharply
9394191 a domestic recession is underway and a rising unemployment rate means that the uptrend in foreclosure rates will spread beyond the sub prime market
9394192 bottom line even if the gses are nationalized there will be no quick fix for the housing market and it appears that the slump has at least another year to run
9394193 merrill lynchs losses in the past 18 months amount to about a quarter of the profits it has made in its 36 years as a listed company according to financial times research that highlights the extent of the global banking crisis
9394194 since the onset of the credit crunch last year merrill has suffered after tax losses of more than 14 billion as its balance sheet has been savaged by almost 52 billion in writedowns and credit related losses
9394195 merrills total inflation adjusted profits between its 1971 listing and 2006 were about 56 billion according to figures from thomson reuters fundamentals and an ft analysis of reported earnings
9394196 the 14 billion in losses for 2007 and the first two quarters of 2008 equal half of merrills profits since the beginning of the decade
9394197 merrill had the highest ratio of credit crunch losses to historical profits among 10 us and european financial groups analysed by the ft which included citigroup jpmorgan chase bank of america morgan stanley goldman sachs lehman brothers bank of america credit suisse and ubs
9394198 ubs which has lost more than 15 billion during the crisis had the second highest ratio
9394199 us companies are set to switch to international accounting rules in a move that will for the first time see all the worlds most important listed groups reporting according to the same set of standards
9394200 the us securities and exchange commission on wednesday proposed a roadmap to manage the migration of us companies from its rules to the international ones the plans are open to comment for 60 days
9394201 more than 100 countries use or are adopting international financial reporting standards ifrs including all 27 european union members as well as china japan canada and india us gaap the accounting lingua franca until the sudden rise of ifrs is the last significant standard to be switched
9394202 under the secs plans us groups are likely to adopt ifrs in 2014 providing certain conditions are met a decision that will be taken in 2011 some companies may be allowed to adopt ifrs sooner
9394203 christopher cox sec chairman said more groups were reporting under ifrs than us gaap and the number would rise as other large economies made the switch he said us gaap would be marginalised if the us did nothing making it harder for international investors to consider us companies
9394204 a single set of globally understood accounting rules is expected to help cut companies cost of capital and better enable cross border investment in countries without strong accounting traditions the rules are expected to raise the quality of reporting helping inward investment
9394205 fdic chairman sheila bair commented in a press conference this afternoon that she expects the credit markets to continue to worsen and judging by the recent action in credit spreads the market seems to agree according to merrill lynch data interest rates on investment grade corporate bonds are currently not only at higher levels than they were at the bear stearns low but they are also at their highest levels ever as of yesterdays close investment grade corporate bonds were yielding 312 basis points more than treasuries which is a 118 increase over year ago levels
9394206 when it comes to gauging how bad things may get for the global economy central bankers say they are uncertain a glance at government bond yields backs that nerve wracking outlook
9394207 in the past month us german uk and japanese bond yields have been falling as investors have dismissed the threat of inflation and priced in a higher risk of global recession led by the big economies
9394208 the expectation of rate cuts in the uk and eurozone should be vindicated by weaker growth and lower inflation in the coming months in the us the sharp cuts earlier this year should suffice unless the economy hits a wall in 2009
9394209 at the centre of the big freeze us policymakers still face challenges as home prices keep falling while inventories of unsold properties rise
9394210 with economic gloom deepening falling us treasury yields have been accompanied by rising yields for corporate and mortgage bonds until house prices stabilise banking writedowns will sustain a bid for government debt at the relative expense of other riskier fixed income securities
9394211 at some point however selling long dated treasuries and buying risky mortgage and corporate bonds will become the dominant trade for investors one barometer to watch will be a sharply steeper yield curve whereby long term yields rise much more than those of the two year note
9394212 once banks have plugged all their balance sheet holes a steeper treasury curve will facilitate borrowing at low rates and the buying of longer dated higher yielding mortgages and other debt call it a carry trade on steroids that slowly helps banks nurse their balance sheets back to health
9394213 unfortunately for the fed the stars are not yet aligned for banks and investors to play the game of ultimate carry which suggests that further selling of risky assets beckons
9394214 on august 26 lowrys selling pressure index reached its highest level ever 756 while lowrys buying power index dropped to a multi year low of 210
9394215 when people dont have much money they cut on big stuff and buy things that make their lives a little bit better like consumer electronics
9394216 to defend something is always to discredit it yes the person who defends that has never believed in it if he does believe then the enthusiasm of faith is not a defence no it is the assault and the victory a believer is a victor

9394231 im definitely very excited with the opportunity to go out there and make the postseason
9394232 you play this game to win a world championship so thats hopefully what well be able to try to accomplish
9394233 well just see hes going to play some second base for us and so will augie
9394234 like a lot of our other positions that are a little uncertain right now well match up and see whos playing well and try to run the best lineup out there that particular day
9394235 our scouts like his arm they said good fastball hes got pretty good strikeout numbers we drafted him out of high school so obviously we have a little bit of a history with him
9394236 we just feel fortunate that we were able to get a decent guy we liked
9394237 the thing about it is its where all that matters is whether you win or lose it doesnt matter the stats or anything like that at the end of the day the only thing that anybody cares about is if you got something in the w column or not
9394238 david eckstein is a very good player and a guy at this point that has a chance to fit an area that has changed a little bit based on orlando hudsons injury in that regard we thought it made sense
9394239 hes been a big part of two teams that won a world series at this stage hes still a plus on base guy he plays hard and hes been a part of winning teams and were glad to have him
9394240 in just over five years the swarms of robots in the british armed forces will outnumber the soldiers
9394241 red ring of we didnt plug in an av cable
9394242 hey were already showing a video image isnt that in essence what live view is maybe we could figure out a way to record it
9394243 i just cannot take it when i think about this city going through that again
9394244 i saw the humvees and the national guard driving down my street this morning and they waved and shouted at me they remember me from back then you know
9394245 and that sorta made me feel better because now at least theres qualified people holding the bad people back
9394246 yep nobody around here the folks here at this time are leaving
9394247 weve been warned i know i heard it all on the news that nah nah blah blah blah whatever
9394248 i dont have a car i dont have a bike
9394249 i moved here from florida and i know what a hurricane is like im staying
9394250 i live with a roommate an older man who is refusing to leave
9394251 i cant in good conscience leave him behind but i want to leave i dont have the energy to go through this again after katrina
9394252 at this point after seeing the weather report im starting to change my mind
9394253 weve gotten a raw deal from hurricanes so i make the decision to stay with seriousness
9394254 ive got 30 000 worth of food for this weekend and the last weather report i saw said it wasnt going to be worse than a 3
9394255 i just cant leave and besides people like you reporters need a place to eat right
9394256 if i think it is going to be bad ill get me and my family out
9394257 i will nothing is worth the harm but for now i dont see the need
9394258 weve got a job to do were caught in the crossfire
9394259 were pretty sure louisiana is going to take the bullet
9394260 they have assured us that this is their first priority
9394261 the louisiana republican party is here to do our duty
9394262 i dont know how much were going to sell them for now but the price is going to have to go up
9394263 weve been out of food since yesterday the people outside are screaming
9394264 life is like living in a cloud for us we never know what is going to happen
9394265 i dont think it will be overnight i think it will happen incrementally
9394266 our job until we leave whenever that is is to continue training the iraqi police training the iraqi army giving them advice and continuing to be a force for stability
9394267 there are things here that i can do without for sure things that we brought here in the bad old days that i simply dont need anymore
9394268 everyone here is working 15 to 20 hours a day
9394269 that is in the marine dna to be in a real fight but this is the toughest part of what we have been doing here putting the plug in the insurgency its very intellectual and requires a tremendous amount of patience
9394270 its taken a long time to get to this point and certainly mistakes were made on the ground in anbar
9394271 things were done that perhaps in retrospect alienated people and caused them to move against us
9394272 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a
9394273 the convention has to go forward the question is what it looks like
9394274 if the convention wasnt in st paul i wouldnt be at the convention
9394275 the biggest advantage of owning your own golf course is that you get to decide what par is
9394276 this is a really exciting step to have discovered the cause of a cancer to have identified what causes it and then to find a vaccine to eradicate it
9394277 here in tayside we will see up to 30 cases of new cervical cancer a year with the vaccine being up to 70 effective we expect to see 21 less women a year
9394278 it really is a disease because it affects young women that also affects an awful lot of people round about them
9394279 they must understand that the vaccine is fantastic news for preventing cervical cancer but it can only be combated by using cervical screening and the vaccine
9394280 so when they are called for screening aged 20 they really must come along whether they have had the vaccine or not
9394281 the authorities are much better organised this time they recognise what they need to do
9394282 the evacuation seems to be going quite well we had the list of evacuation centres and were heading out to today to find out if there are any uk nationals
9394283 we will find out how many people are there and what kind of assistance they need whether thats financial the situation should be ok with food and drink or whether its contacting people back in the uk
9394284 on the way out to the airport we saw many tourists preparing to abandon the city
9394285 i was glad i was leaving when i was and hadnt chosen to wait until things got really competitive
9394286 were all very prepared here its the old adage prepare for the worst hope for the best were not a bunch of idiots staying here
9394287 i just have a lot of friends here in the neighbourhood who are staying and the pub is a community centre for the neighbourhood
9394288 there are people in the world who live every day without electricity air conditioning endless supplies of food and shelter
9394289 our overriding concern is that the church and its early medieval sculpture should survive as an entity in govan where they belong
9394290 we believe this is a priceless treasure thats been seriously undervalued if treated with imagination and sensitivity it has the potential to bring great benefits to govan and the local community
9394291 but the challenge for us in these days of ever dwindling public finances is to come up with a proposal thats viable
9394292 well focus initially on three ideas a publicly funded museum a visitor centre and performance venue and a visitor centre linked to neighbouring business accommodation
9394293 my point is that we dont need to accelerate the appreciation of the renminbi the dollar will not weaken very much and may get stronger as happened
9394294 this makes appreciation of the chinese currency against the dollar less necessary
9394295 i guess its just nice to play well pretty simple
9394296 this is probably the most intimidating court in the world if youve never been on it before
9394297 my mom told me that i am losing a little bit of weight
9394298 im actually not losing weight im just getting firmer you know
9394299 this transaction is a milestone for banking consolidation in germany
9394300 the deal will secure many attractive jobs for the long term even though unfortunately we cannot keep all current positions
9394301 we are looking for amicable solutions and will closely involve employee representatives in all of the necessary measures this is part of our corporate culture
9394302 the largest shareholder by far and a strong partner of the new bank
9394303 in my mind it was so clear and so obvious that something had to be done
9394304 some of you even sneaked out of the teams hotel during the games and checked into another hotel thinking that nobody knows and you are smart now i tell you you are pretending to be smart what you are doing i know everything you checked in at 9 50 and checked out at 10 20 is this normal behavior
9394305 we hope that everyone will be impressed with the new look centre and everything it has to offer
9394306 im looking at him right now and i see perfection
9394307 yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9394308 das war enorm wichtig ich bin bergl cklich dass es geklappt hat
9394309 they are both completely non verbal with severe adhd and autism the oldest and a severe genetic disorder that causes the youngest to not be able to walk or talk at age 3
9394310 she throws severe tantrums when she doesnt get her way
9394311 dont do the worst you can to your enemy for perchance he may become your friend
9394312 pretty much from the get go i didnt have my good stuff
9394313 right when i got out there i knew something wasnt right i was struggling to get ahead it was just brutal
9394314 but again ive watched this for a number of years hes one of the best right hand hitters that has played the game in my lifetime he doesnt give an at bat away
9394315 so even though yeah i went deep into the game i still look at it as a disappointing start because you know that your job is sometimes the starting pitcher has to pick up the offense and vice versa
9394316 a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
9394317 we cant afford much more weve got pretty good depth at both spots offensive and defensive tackle as far as finishing out the season but i dont think we can take much more
9394318 oh yeah i dont think there would be any question about that
9394319 he knows it could be a blessing in the long run if he rehabs well and gets maybe even in better condition than he was this year so hes looking at the bright side right now
9394320 our hitters are really on right now and our pitchers are pitching as good as ever were really putting it together right now
9394321 i think if you take care of the seconds the minutes and hours will take care of themselves
9394322 not real pleased youve got to sit there and watch 180 pitches everyday id rather have the fastball thrown over the plate and have people hit it instead of giving runs away like that it will be addressed
9394323 weve been playing good all year i think especially to split the series here in chicago against the cubs at home i think it says a lot
9394324 why is it frustrating why should it be are we supposed to win every day i dont think so
9394325 what the hell am i supposed to be not ok
9394326 in any situation if you can minimize damage and limit it to singles it forces them to have to hit the ball more often to score runs and they scored two
9394327 its really hard to talk about because when you throw mickey mantles name around thats probably one of the greatest home run hitters of all time
9394328 any time you talk about it the energy level is there from the start i think we were ready to go and it showed
9394329 this was probably maybe one of the bigger wins weve had all year
9394330 but i think hes worried more about us winning than his milestones
9394331 there wasnt one guy in here that didnt want him up at that point
9394332 im not going to change my game plan neither is he
9394333 then he got comfortable and started throwing that breaking ball
9394334 until i see that last day when weve won the division im not going to be relaxed
9394335 hopefully things can be different i dont think this team is giving you any hints of showing what happened last year its a different group
9394336 i had to battle a lot i was a little sluggish but managed to use my experience
9394337 he didnt have his greatest stuff but he pitched magnificently
9394338 i think we have a run in us where well win five six seven in a row
9394339 being my first year in the major leagues you couldnt ask for a more exciting team and situation to be put in
9394340 unfortunately we didnt score enough runs thats been out story the last month or so not scoring runs
9394341 we cannot worry about what happened last year because this is a new year for us
9394342 were playing good baseball right now hopefully we can continue that
9394343 weve been playing good all year i think especially to split the series here in chicago against the cubs at home i think it says a lot
9394344 why is it frustrating why should it be are we supposed to win every day i dont think so
9394345 what the hell am i supposed to be not ok
9394346 in any situation if you can minimize damage and limit it to singles it forces them to have to hit the ball more often to score runs and they scored two

9394349 we can still have very regal looking guards who look fantastic
9394350 we felt doing this kind of thing was a way of keeping with the times and keeping that iconic status
9394351 most people think its fake fur and when they find out its real and it takes one bear to make a hat they are appalled
9394352 we think we are a modern nation but the queens guards are walking round with an entire dead bear on their heads

9394357 the president called me up really early in the morning
9394358 as i drive around here i just dont see a lot of people
9394359 they really are die hards because theyre taking their lives in their hands
9394360 its really unfortunate if people dont heed the mandate to get out
9394361 the most important thing is were going to help people rebuild their lives
9394362 the citizens of terrebonne parish are doing a great job
9394363 theres a time when we cant respond to them any more
9394364 all the countries in the international community are looking for more and greater leadership from the united states
9394365 this could be potentially the most dangerous storm for the energy sector weve ever seen said chris jarvis senior analyst at caprock risk management in
9394366 the industry is much more prepared and taking things much more seriously thats why so much has been shut down so quickly
9394367 all this happening and all anyone wants to watch is bug bunny

9394369 its not too late to evacuate i strongly encourage you to do so
9394370 i cant take a chance because so many people died in katrina
9394371 it remains likely that gustav will prove to become a worst case scenario for the producing region and places the heart of the oil production region under a high risk of sustaining significant or major damage
9394372 this wasnt a decision based on my play i want to make that clear
9394373 they werent comfortable with two guys making big salaries at the same position im not mad or bitter about this but i am disappointed in the timing
9394374 he has been significant to this organization beyond me well see what happens it may not be over
9394375 ive seen rudi practice very few times and cut it loose very few times
9394376 i thought he had a great spring and was doing everything but unfortunately he seemed to suffer from the hamstring
9394377 most lessons took place in school halls or gymnasiums only a few lessons were observed outdoors
9394378 overall pupils changing facilities for physical education were too limited with a consequence that pupils had to change in classrooms and in toilets
9394379 in many schools the gymnasium also served as a dining area
9394380 most had access to tarmac playgrounds and grass playing fields only a few schools had high quality outdoor facilities
9394381 schools really need facilities resources and teacher skills to make it happen
9394382 theres a lag in the time scale for more investment in school buildings
9394383 were keen to get ahead and get schools built with the next round of funding
9394384 were waiting for the scottish governments decision on the scottish futures trust
9394385 we expect that the scottish futures trust sft company will be formally established shortly and we will inform parliament when this happens
9394386 he accomplished a no hitter and wasnt given what he deserved that should have been a no hitter
9394387 thats a stinking no hitter we all got cheated from i feel horrible for cc
9394388 we are putting together a dvd with all the replays we have and sending it to mlb tomorrow
9394389 we had to send a call in earlier this season and got it reversed so hopefully we can go 2 for 2
9394390 thats a joke that wasnt even close whoever the scorekeeper was absolutely denied major league baseball a nice no hitter right there
9394391 they threw hit up on the board even before laroche hit the bag
9394392 the ball was still rolling and i probably should have picked it up with my glove we probably wouldnt be having this conversation
9394393 i think if i pick it up with my glove i get him
9394394 id like to think it was a hit from a selfish standpoint id like it to be a hit but you could make a case either way but im hitting 160 i need every hit i can get
9394395 hes been dominant since he came over and hopefully he and rest of the team will take us to the promised land
9394396 its fun to watch him pitch unfortunately he was on the other side
9394397 i thought a 66 or a 65 would be a great round
9394398 starting this year i decided to tell myself something similar to what vijay told himself last week that im a great putter and that im a lot better than people think and people write
9394399 so today was a good reflection and if you look at my putting stats for the year im one of the great putters on tour
9394400 its time to step it up and give a little kick on my butt and join them so ive been working on that
9394401 some guys that are hungry to win for the first time guys that havent won many times and im trying to do the same thing i just want to keep playing my type of golf hopefully i can hit it a little better and find a few more fairways
9394402 he has been significant to me he has been significant to this organization beyond me well see what happens it may not be over
9394403 ive seen rudi practice very few times and cut it loose very few times
9394404 i thought he had a great spring and was doing everything but unfortunately he seemed to suffer from the hamstring

9394407 i think were in a more perilous position that weve ever been at any time in our history
9394408 the anti drug fight in venezuela has shown significant progress during recent years especially since the government ended official with the dea
9394409 some days hes quiet some days hes hyper and i dont know what like he had too much caffeine hes wearing all these crazy clothes you never know what youre going to get out of him each and every day when it comes to his personality
9394410 i think he gives everything hes got he loves to play
9394411 i think chris challenges himself every day hes quite a guy because hes a very good athlete but wants to get better each time hes thinking things through of how he can do it better when he gets out on the field and he just gives everything hes got
9394412 when someone can jump into the league and earn more than a veteran without playing a single down its hard to stomach
9394413 because of the nature and popularity of this game if i can just be myself and show who i am i think people will like that
9394414 im really not concerned if people are down on me or not or what peoples opinions are i think what we do is entertain people and whether i make you happy or mad or whether you like me or not if i entertain you or if i create something where youre excited about football all in all i think thats good for me and good for the sport
9394415 its been fast i played four years i cant believe this is my fifth year
9394416 it really does feel like i just got here and then at the same time theres so much ive put in and so much ive invested in this team that i guess its not strange to be called that
9394417 weve got a job to do were caught in the crossfire
9394418 were pretty sure louisiana is going to take the bullet
9394419 they have assured us that this is their first priority
9394420 the louisiana republican party is here to do our duty
9394421 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9394422 theres very little doubt that we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action action to help our fellow citizens in this time of tragedy and disaster action in the form of volunteering donations reaching out our hands and our hearts and our wallets to the people who are under such great threat from this great natural disaster
9394423 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9394424 take off their republican hats and put on their american hats
9394425 in light of these events i will not be going to minnesota for the republican national convention
9394426 im going to travel down to texas tomorrow to visit with the emergency operations center in austin where coordination among federal state and local government officials is occurring i intend to go down to san antonio where state and local officials are prepositioning relief materials for texas and louisiana and ill have a chance to visit with residents of both states who have been evacuated
9394427 we need to be sensitive to this as we go forward
9394428 we can activate an e mail list of a couple million people who want to give back
9394429 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9394430 mccain needs a good convention gustav is making that tough
9394431 all the houses in our village have nearly collapsed and right now we are risking our lives to bring our belongings out of our homes
9394432 in our village there are 60 to 70 people who are seriously injured and staying in the playground of our elementary school
9394433 we dont have enough clothes or canvas to shelter ourselves so we have to sew plastic bags together
9394434 from yesterday to this afternoon weve only eaten once i am very frightened the year of 2008 is a year full of disasters
9394435 currently the biggest problem for us is a shortage of big tents and blankets we have already distributed more than 2 000 tents
9394436 we sent most of our people to the countryside to see if any people are still buried the situation there is still unclear now
9394437 there are so many disasters this year and the peoples mood is very low here
9394438 the earthquakes are a serious and somber topic around here
9394439 i saw dust in the air from the collapsed houses and just now i felt two aftershocks how can i not be worried
9394440 today the government sent people to the village to check but we only have four tents so i have to buy rain clothes and set up a shelter by myself our school was planning to start the new semester tomorrow but i think that must be postponed now
9394441 legislative accomplishments are few and far between because he cannot work well and bring people together and persuade them of a positive issue
9394442 its a lot closer to a revolution than to a routine day at the office
9394443 the republicans are about to nominate the only person in our party distinct enough from the rest to have a chance of winning in what ought to be a very bad year he is our most different candidate since teddy roosevelt
9394444 the overwhelming evidence that climate change is taking place argues that we address the issue
9394445 really focuses on government spending it would be a radical change for washington d c
9394446 hes taking sides in an internal republican fight between the appropriators who always want to spend more and the rest of the party i think he can win it because despite the cacophony of special interest protests hell have popular support
9394447 when subsets with at least 16 questions are used the resulting error rates are tolerable and for subsets of size 24 or greater they are very low
9394448 devagar bonde na pra a ainda borda delicadeza torna a gente banca de flores libertando sorrisos no ar
9394449 we were trying to survive on just water for the last 10 days but its not enough
9394450 we were trapped with nothing after our houses were swept away
9394451 we have sent packets of rice and sugar to the stranded
9394452 the situation is definitely bad but now the army has joined in and rescue operations will be speeded up
9394453 the recalculation probably worked in our favour but we batted really well but i asked the boys to do a job and they have done it today winning becomes a habit and when you start winning game after game after game you learn how to win
9394454 andrew is playing some of the best cricket of his career
9394455 i know owais would come good he proved what a good player he is he delivered today and played some fantastic shots
9394456 the dressing room is down we pride ourselves on our results but there are some positives to take out today we are learning from our mistakes and we have some young players learning about
9394457 flintoff has been unbelievable he has proved he is a good player and he adds balance to the england side he is a world class performer
9394458 cest alors plus quune mode une furie selon lhumeur du jour les mouches sont en forme de lune d toiles ou de fleurs et se prom nent sur les visages
9394459 we came up with three names that were some of our chronic inebriates in the downtown area that got arrested the most often
9394460 we tracked those three individuals through just one of our two hospitals one of the guys had been in jail previously so hed only been on the streets for six months in those six months he had accumulated a bill of a hundred thousand dollars and thats at the smaller of the two hospitals near downtown reno its pretty reasonable to assume that the other hospital had an even larger bill another individual came from portland and had been in reno for three months in those three months he had accumulated a bill for sixty five thousand dollars the third individual actually had some periods of being sober and had accumulated a bill of fifty thousand
9394461 it cost us one million dollars not to do something about murray
9394462 a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage
9394463 a bobblehead for every big league player on the bubble
9394464 we were one hit away from tying or winning it in all three games that was the story of the series
9394465 if they were horrible pitches i wouldve been more concerned
9394466 he wasnt missing that much i was confident he would find the zone
9394467 it probably was a sure double play but i just reacted and touched it
9394468 he had no play on that ball it kind of dominoed from there
9394469 i tried to make a good play and be aggressive and i threw it away
9394470 you have an 80 000 pound vehicle versus probably a 4 000 pound vehicle that doesnt match up
9394471 i was a little nervous on the bus coming up but the closer we got i started feeling fine it feels good to be back in the groove i wanted to keep the pace of the game going we made some mistakes but they are things you can correct and get better
9394472 we fought hard saturday and this game makes you want to go out and play hard this week against austin peay
9394473 he threw into coverage which was a mistake but those things happen in a football game you cant fault the effort
9394474 it was a dream of mine to score a touchdown in this stadium
9394475 we were a little nervous but as the game went on i think they figured out that football is football the biggest question we had was our offensive line and we got that answered i thought we ran the ball exceptionally well against a really good defense
9394476 early on we dropped some passes and gave up some big plays but overall there were more positives than negatives im fired up because weve got some guys who will go out there and fight
9394477 i just said hey ive really got to get a hold of this
9394478 the freshmen did good i think guys did all right
9394479 a j had a good day i think caleb king and richard samuel ran the ball well cordy glenn starting at right guard did a good job we had guys step up and make some plays which was good
9394480 i was just nervous about getting in there the first time in the first game
9394481 i was anxious to get the ball and make a play
9394482 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9394483 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9394484 i was trying to get situated at home i was trying to get things so it would be halfway safe
9394485 youre torn do you leave it and worry about it or do you stay and worry about living
9394486 theres really no place to go all the hotels are booked up to little rock and beyond
9394487 if we flood again were goners i dont think were coming back
9394488 i think for people who havent left they really are die hards because theyre taking their lives in their hands
9394489 i cant see any reason why a person staring down the barrel of a category 3 or category 4 hurricane would want to see if they can try to outfox mother nature thats taking an awful risk with yourself and your family
9394490 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our backyard
9394491 he didnt go to the hospital so obviously he didnt think he was hurt that badly
9394492 what a sad situation we know people get hit all the time playing football
9394493 this is one of the saddest stories ive seen in a long time
9394494 also major problems into the future we have numbers of volunteers decreasing people are moving into urban interface areas which is a lot riskier
9394495 i just called the broward county fla court clerk and chad johnson is no longer officially legally yesterday his name was changed to chad ocho cinco
9394496 the lsu appalachian state football game is now scheduled for 10 a m saturday lsu and governors office officials decided today
9394497 its been a very long week and i think a lot of misspent energy has been taken up by obvious press media players everybody its just so mentally draining to be in this position to listen to read to hear all the b s this week im spent im exhausted i didnt want to finish the last two tournaments like this
9394498 well if i had to say it of course id like to be like reggie bush and l t ladanian tomlinson you know a good little mix of them
9394499 we did a very fine job blocking for him a very fine job
9394500 he did have some plays though where he had to break tackles and he had to make people miss he was a very impressive runner
9394501 not having a chance to be out there playing in more than a year and a half it really felt good to play saturday
9394502 when they first called my number i wouldnt say i was scared but i was really nervous
9394503 i was just so focused on playing at that point
9394504 oh that just helps us so much more as a backfield to see guys step up like caleb
9394505 it keeps everyone fresh when we go to the sidelines and just lets us all know that whoever is in there will make a big play and make long runs
9394506 really i just about fainted then there was a sigh of relief when i saw the ball bounce off his knee
9394507 we left a bunch of points out there there were five opportunities in the first quarter that if we come back and score twice and the game shouldve been out of hand

9394510 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day im not sure weve seen anything like this
9394511 if you are stubborn enough if you are not taking this as seriously as we need you to take it and if you decide to stay you are on your own anyone who decides to stay ill say it like i said it before katrina make sure you have an axe because you will be carving your way or busting your way out of your attic to get on your roof with waters that you will be surrounded with in this event

9394516 i demand shared physical and legal custody of my children if my soon to be ex wife disagrees then i demand sole physical and legal custody and will permit as much visitation to her as she requires within reason furthermore if the court intends to deny me the minimally acceptable shared custody of my children i demand it produce findings of fact as to why and how i am a danger or harmful to my child if the court intends to take custody of my child away from me i demand it give the reasons why i am unfit and constitute a danger to my child

9394525 but this has never happened before to anyones convention so we need some time to touch all the bases

9394532 im feeling the shots a lot better than i did especially in the beginning of the tournament in the first few rounds
9394533 so that is my goal to strive to keep improving day by day and try to get my game together again
9394534 in the first set she played quite solid putting all these balls back she didnt make any errors i was the one who was all over the place
9394535 i couldnt really find my rhythm in these kind of conditions and she took advantage of that

9394543 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention if necessary to act as americans not republicans because america needs us now no matter whether we are republican or democrat
9394544 theres communication with the delegations in terms of making sure they have what they need and with the gulf state governors
9394545 i dont like the idea of being that far away but we already had our plane tickets and hotel and hopefully the convention will be enjoyable and will keep our mind off of the storm theres a lot of angst and anxiety involved especially after katrina in 2005
9394546 was a black eye for the bush administration im concerned about our property and our citizens and im concerned about media coverage

9394556 instead of doing that how about having delegates on the floor putting together relief packages and sending a group of volunteers down afterward with sarah palin in charge
9394557 would turn republicans into red cross type volunteers who would help collect donations food and goods to help storm victims

9394567 it seems abortion advocates greatest fear is not of what the fetal homicide bill actually does legally but of how it might encourage people to think about the unborn child
9394568 we have been paying huge amounts of money to the electricity company but are getting no electricity in return
9394569 the humidity is killing us and there is no electricity to turn on the ventilator
9394570 we are seeking an explanation not a justification for what happened such explanation will be provided through judicial investigations and not political interpretations
9394571 everybody was worried after what happened on thursday but hizbullahs handing over of the assailant has helped reduce our fears
9394572 regardless of whether the attack was intentional or not it proved that we are living under unnatural conditions
9394573 is this a natural incident that could happen in any country in the world
9394574 if not why should lebanon and its army live under unnatural conditions
9394575 what happened is really dangerous and reminds us of what used to happen in the 1970s between palestinian guerrillas and the lebanese army
9394576 i kept complaining that the banks records showed i was overdrawn when i shouldnt be
9394577 sarah palin is going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years and most doctors think that hell be around at least that long
9394578 but i dont think it gets fill in relevant democrats name here anywhere to attack her him it them at all
9394579 her lack of experience may appear to blunt the attack on obamas but obama cant really attack her on that score
9394580 imam sadrs wisdom tolerance and constant struggle against poverty and sectarianism made him win the hearts of the lebanese from all sects
9394581 in light of the current tensions on the lebanese and regional scenes we are more than ever in need of the imams wise opinion
9394582 its high time we listened to the imams words and engaged in this universal fight
9394583 he was also one of the first to raise awareness about the dangers and threats posed by israel
9394584 arms will not solve the crisis but will increase the divisions of the nation
9394585 unity among sects should not be a slogan used during public occasions and rallies
9394586 the lebanese should realize that a fragile security situation will have negative repercussions on all lebanon
9394587 wont rest until they discover the truth about imam sadrs disappearance
9394588 the kingdom of saudi arabia not only contributes to the reconstruction of lebanon but also works hard on building bridges between various lebanese groups
9394589 stands at an equal distance from all lebanese groups and embraces their hopes and fears
9394590 will hopefully help in erasing some of the grievances of the summer 2006 war and herald the start of a new era of piece and stability
9394591 we used the same tiles and material used when the bridge was first built
9394592 determined to lend a helping hand to lebanon whenever the lebanese need it
9394593 the kingdom of saudi arabia is committed to preserving peace and stability in lebanon
9394594 without the base you lose you lose workers you lose money and you lose the election
9394595 the convention represents the heart and guts of the republican party they come together by the thousands to be inspired and take that inspiration back to the front lines
9394596 you cant energize swings if all the press writes about is how the party is divided showing strength will attract swings but it wont be done without taking care of the base first
9394597 conventions should never be aimed at the swing voter because very few voters in that category have the patience to watch a partisan convention you have to be a true disciple of the business to stomach either national convention and those still on the fence would rather keep their lunch digesting
9394598 mccain is already doing better among swing voters than any other republican in recent memory pre convention we need the base to help our congressional candidates
9394599 get your guys energized now the swing comes in september and october
9394600 normally you want to animate the base but this is an election mccain cant win without invading and ultimately owning the center the exercise is to push obama over to the left and occupy the field between the 40 yard lines a little maybe even a lot of grumbling from the base amplifies the point call it constructive pain
9394601 in this race the swing voter will decide the winner both parties will hold their base
9394602 appeal to independents and reagan democrats the base is there go get the middle
9394603 conservatives are angry at obama and will go to the voting booth for mccain
9394604 swing voters are now giving mccain a serious look he may only have one shot at getting them
9394605 mccain can win in november only with swing voters so appealing to independents should be the focus of the gop convention besides the democratic convention served our purposes for motivating our base
9394606 swing voters especially this year when the republican brand is so weak
9394607 swing voters will determine the outcome of this election no matter what karl rove says
9394608 mccain should not make the mistake that 41 did in 1992 and hold a convention that was all about the base the general election has begun the fight is for the swing voter and our convention should reflect that
9394609 unfortunately there are fewer republican voters than there have been for some time and more democrats we have to do well with swing voters to win
9394610 conservatives would be insane to not understand just how liberal the democratic ticket is with the no 1 and no 3 most liberal senators
9394611 mccain has to begin to win over the center spend the afternoon talking to the base before prime time and the hour of tv coverage talking to swing voters
9394612 at this point if you cant move the swing it dont mean a thing
9394613 power governmentality resistance and state of exception in the arab world
9394614 model to all our students of the benefits of an open society that creates opportunities for liberal debate and even dissent and dissonance
9394615 in fact many of these regimes have become even more anchored after being reinvigorated and reinstalled
9394616 the mubaraks assads and al sauds etc are still in place controlling politics and the economy
9394617 so the problem could lie with the researchers and not just the rulers
9394618 what is required are serious studies and research in order to reformulate arab regimes
9394619 discussions of governing by exception are still in their infancy
9394620 the workshop draws on the observation that since their independence arab states have been governed by states of emergency exception and occupation
9394621 the state formation in this region has witnessed a production of different forms of citizenship refugee ness and statelessness
9394622 the question is not to describe authoritarianism in the arab world but to go beyond the binary dichotomy of authoritarian regimes versus democratic regimes and to analyze the art of governance used in the region in order to control the populations and to restrict them to the public sphere
9394623 cases of severe poverty coupled with recurring outbursts of state repression conflict and displacement as in iraq south of sudan and darfour states of military occupation as in the palestinian territory and in iraq and spaces of exception as detention camps of iraqi refugees and palestinian refugee camps dated since 1948 as well as military global and local insurgencies and resistance
9394624 through unpacking the relationship between power sovereignty and control this workshop will privilege the study of certain mechanisms of powers deployed by the sovereigns namely states of exception and bio politics
9394625 the challenges facing mccain at the convention are a little longer
9394626 i dont think mccain can follow the path we did in 2004
9394627 to win this time we have to run a campaign that is much more directed at the center of the electorate and much more focused on acquiring swing voters while still trying to get as much support from your base
9394628 what the bush people did in 2004 deserves to be in the political hall of fame
9394629 if john mccain doesnt replicate george bushs turnout of 61 9 million voters hes obviously going to lose in a very major way
9394630 if he replicates and doesnt grow it hes going to lose most of these states
9394631 shes like an alaskan ostrich burying her head in the tundra to avoid scientists warnings
9394632 her support for big oils energy agenda blinds her to melting ice
9394633 based on the best available science which shows the loss of ice threatens polar bear habitat
9394634 there is insufficient evidence that polar bears are in danger of becoming extinct within the foreseeable future the trigger for protection under the endangered species act
9394635 the present or threatened destruction modification or curtailment of a species habitat or range
9394636 the strongest form of communication is one on one so you gotta face somebody and you gotta look em in the eye
9394637 you have to stop writing because im looking in your eyes and so you gotta look at me
9394638 the war in iraq certainly isnt slowing down which is the point of the demonstration we dont have the same media problem the gop does it looks bad for them to be partying but it doesnt look bad for us to promote human rights
9394639 if we found a meth lab what does that do to improve a community it makes it safer
9394640 maybe there arent a lot of weapons there but there are a lot of dangerous chemicals and activities associated with that
9394641 what theyre doing is trying to disable people from being able to participate in protests at the convention
9394642 its a permitted march we have a legal right to do it
9394643 i think a mccain republican is a person who believes in limited government and putting a cap on out of control spending
9394644 i think a mccain republican is a very traditional orthodox republican and is also one who recognizes that republicans need to be leaders in everything from energy independence to conservation things i really applaud him for i think thats one of the reasons that for some of us its easy to be supportive of him because he does have a very broad agenda
9394645 there is no group within the party that is completely comfortable with mccain
9394646 a mccain republican is more of a reformer than a conservative
9394647 mccain republicans are change oriented and future focused their highest priority for government is to make it smarter rather than smaller and their no 1 priority is the restoration of accountability
9394648 mccain is returning the party to its roots of fiscal restraint
9394649 but hes also expanding the boundaries particularly on environmental issues which will be very important for the party to grow in the future
9394650 a mccain republican is someone who thinks that global warming is important and immigration reform is important and campaign finance reform was an attempt to clean up the system
9394651 and someone who thinks given that we are in two wars it might be important to have someone with military credentials in the white house and it might be helpful to have someone who was right on something as important as the iraq surge
9394652 mccain brings a combination of the best qualities of three prior nominees
9394653 theres some part of obamas message thats no longer appealing to them
9394654 they were real excited about this new flashy obama thing
9394655 i have long felt that there was plenty of potential for the vote to shift
9394656 people see all this support for obama which is big but actually a majority of young voters in the primaries voted for someone else either another democrat or the republican
9394657 even if you disagree with him specifically you can really find a respect for him
9394658 hell do what he believes is right for the country and not necessarily what he believes is politically expedient for him at the time
9394659 technology is not only increasingly available but its a medium in which young people communicate
9394660 theyre not doing it because theyre good guys but because there are votes to be won
9394661 more people are definitely mobilizing for obama and unless the republicans do something to change that it will cause there to be a large surge of young votes for obama
9394662 i also think thats changeable but they have to actually try to change it
9394663 cmon leo you can come out of the corner we know you didnt mean it
9394664 katrina 2 should land sunday in no looks like god doesnt want another republican white house congress either
9394665 it was a mistake and it was a satirical statement made in jest and one that i clearly dont believe
9394666 its hard not to attibute bad motives to you when you willingly admit that you would cheerfully disinform in order to win power
9394667 i guess its just nice to play well pretty simple
9394668 this is probably the most intimidating court in the world if youve never been on it before
9394669 my mom told me that i am losing a little bit of weight
9394670 im actually not losing weight im just getting firmer you know
9394671 it was one of my goals coming into this season next to trying to win wimbledon i missed that one oh well
9394672 its a goal but i want to win a grand slam
9394673 weve been out of food since yesterday the people outside are screaming
9394674 life is like living in a cloud for us we never know what is going to happen
9394675 when the ana afghan army and coalition troops got close to the village firing started after the ana unit stopped and the coalition forces conducted the operation in the village
9394676 i have asked all u n agencies working in afghanistan to step up support to the local authorities as they work to help the survivors
9394677 i dont think i can do another katrina but i can definitely do what were doing today because its smooth its effective and its getting the job done
9394678 and well be able to get our people back with little hassle
9394679 because i do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of emergency personnel
9394680 we sent a message out to the country three years ago that was absolutely horrendous and we know that
9394681 they took all the criticism all that happened and applied some processes that are working
9394682 in nagins case what he has to do is be a leader of all people in new orleans and quietly solidly execute
9394683 no flamboyance no loudness no treatment of the media one way or the other just keep your head down and do this well
9394684 so be it i had a great time here in tampa i met a lot of people and it was truly a great start to my nfl career here
9394685 i truly enjoyed it and have nothing but good things to say about being here
9394686 i thought a 66 or a 65 would be a great round
9394687 starting this year i decided to tell myself something similar to what vijay told himself last week that im a great putter and that im a lot better than people think and people write
9394688 so today was a good reflection and if you look at my putting stats for the year im one of the great putters on tour
9394689 its time to step it up and give a little kick on my butt and join them so ive been working on that
9394690 the vp candidate who appeals to women with his authorship and championing of landmark domestic violence legislation support for pay equity and advocacy for women around the world
9394691 the first black presidential nominee ever of a major party in history
9394692 i run into connecticut women in their 40s and 50s and professional experience
9394693 after you work your way up from pta to governor and have an 80 percent approval rating sure
9394694 connecticut women in their 40s and 50s almost all with college or advanced degrees and professional experience
9394695 all these women are now wishing they were republicans because they would be qualified to be president too
9394696 both a gustav watch and a palin watch thread to see which is the greater disaster
9394697 one doesnt anticipate that ones private conversation will be surreptitiously taped by some right wing nutcase
9394698 writers come from master of fine arts programs now if you add up the college education of steinbeck hemingway and faulkner you get to spring break of freshman year
9394699 whoever thinks the future is going to be easier than the past is certainly mad
9394700 u s barriers to russias joining the world trade organization not rais ing them
9394701 a utocratic russia is more likely to evolve into something more open if it is integrated into modern institutions than if it is left outside
9394702 its wonderful it will make his daughters feel like they could be president someday
9394703 what a joke it makes me feel like i could have been president
9394704 if the response from the conservative base is any indication mccain has hit a home run with the palin selection
9394705 katrina was hard especially when you see people who thought they were safe and the levies breached
9394706 for a k 9 search team well go into a disaster area well send the dogs in first to look for survivors live people
9394707 at present it doesnt look like a direct hit will be taken by gustav but i would remind you of hurricane charlie and the right hand turn charlie made at the last minute
9394708 it came into punta gorda instead of tampa bay so there are no rules for these things
9394709 today its been a category 3 storm all day doesnt look like its going to strengthen anymore
9394710 its running out of time the waters are a little bit cooler in the northern gulf and theres a little bit of wind shear coming in from the south
9394711 as for the effects on us we have about the worst of it now with wind gusts at 25 mph
9394712 and were going to see some higher than normal high tides coming in here with 3 5 foot waters just near the shore but i dont expect anything more than a couple of feet above our normal tides
9394713 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans we have to join the 300 million other americans on behalf of our fellow citizens its a time for action so were going to suspend most of our activities tomorrow except for those absolutely necessary
9394714 tomorrows program will be business only and will refrain from any political rhetoric that would be traditional in an opening session of a convention
9394715 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9394716 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention to act as americans not republicans because america needs us now no matter whether we are republican or democrat he said
9394717 he wants to do something service oriented if and when the storm hits and its as bad as its expected to be now
9394718 es simplemente porque todo lo relacionado con su nueva fragancia es violeta
9394719 forty paintings in 30 days is a hectic schedule to keep but i am really happy to have done it i managed to link it all up and produce my first book also titled the boy who loved clouds which will be out in the market on sept 14
9394720 ok i will be honest that is exactly why i did it
9394721 why are they even considering cutting bed numbers when it would seem to be more in the community interest to be actively recruiting
9394722 this community is becoming increasingly anxious about the state of the health service and i dont blame them
9394723 i recall being promised by dr claire blizard that there would be an increase in staff numbers at bathurst hospital
9394724 we continually seem to be promised things only to have them taken away
9394725 if we are having a staffing problem in 2008 what will it be like five years from now or 10 years from now she asked
9394726 also if we dont have the staff numbers to maintain bed numbers now where are they going to pluck them from when the surge is on
9394727 this has not occurred so far and i am anxious to know whether the clinicians have been consulted either
9394728 now information regarding the suggested cuts to bed numbers and the reorganisation of clusters within the greater western area health service has come to light
9394729 despite assurances of community consultation it is disappointing to find our main source of information is still the media
9394730 the shortage of nurses is a statewide problem aggravated by their heavy workload
9394731 this is understandable but obviously the systems broken and needs to be fixed
9394732 ms davis said patients need not be concerned this strategy will affect front line care
9394733 we were also told gwahs is endeavouring to increase the capacity of community acute post acute care capac and ambulatory care as well as changing the role of managers getting them out of the offices to engage more with staff and patients
9394734 this is a shameful attempt by gwahs management to shift the goal posts on the operating capacity of bathurst hospital
9394735 bed numbers are meaningless if they are not available to be accessed when they are needed to admit patients
9394736 instead of redoubling their efforts to boost the number of nurses on hand at bathurst hospital gwahs seem to be prepared to force more local residents to travel to orange hospital to access treatment putting a further strain on medical services there
9394737 they should not be forced to ferry themselves or friends and family to orange for treatment simply because of the iemma labor governments failure to adequately resource bathurst hospital
9394738 kens death came as a dreadful shock our youngest child was nine at the time and wed just bought a house to retire in
9394739 he was always tired he would come home from work tired and hed have pins and needles all the time
9394740 when i look back now i can see the symptoms were there i remember the day he died he went into the kitchen and took some medicine we really thought it was just indigestion
9394741 i want to help the heart foundation make more people more aware of the warning signs so when a heart foundation volunteer knocks on your door this month please dig deep and make a generous donation
9394742 as a charity we rely on volunteers like rose and public donations to carry out our lifesaving work money raised by the 2008 doorknock appeal will help us fund critical research and community projects to improve awareness prevention and treatment of heart disease and stroke
9394743 i am determined to get out in my senior years and enjoy life
9394744 i feel extremely proud of this council and the way we have been able to achieve so much during this first term while managing to stay within ratepegging limits
9394745 im looking forward to my retirement and going back to being a full time farmer
9394746 my time spent serving the community was very enjoyable but i cant wait to spend more time with my children and grandchildren
9394747 i had hoped to see it finished during my term but there are still eight kilometres left to seal
9394748 i knew heath quite well and had talked to him about the pressures of being a celebrity and his responsibilities to so many people
9394749 a lot of people feel like they knew him when that happens you have to keep a certain amount to yourself anything you say can be used and abused
9394750 to me it could be the most important painting i will ever do because it means so much personally i was lucky to be there and have him open up at that time of his life i was just really lucky
9394751 it is the exhibition everybody sees and has an opinion on people can come in and feel comfortable having that opinion
9394752 i had been asking heath for many years to sit for me but he was very conscious of being painted because it would be of himself not in character
9394753 one day he phoned up and asked if i would paint him because he was feeling comfortable with himself at that moment
9394754 i think he was very conscious and quite nervous because he was a very private person
9394755 now other people can have the same connection with heath that i have had
9394756 since it opened there have been many days of bed block where patients are held in the emergency department because there are no beds on the wards
9394757 many patients including pregnant mothers children dialysis patients and even general surgical patients are being rerouted to orange lithgow or sydney because there are not enough beds in bathurst
9394758 while we take heart in the fine looking building provided for bathurst and surrounding towns no one can say that it functions better than or even as well as the old hospital
9394759 experience has taught us that whenever beds are closed they do not reopen
9394760 is entirely opposite to the needs of the current situation
9394761 it is important for the public to realise that reductions in bed numbers reduce the ability of bathurst to function as a referral centre for its community and for its traditional catchment area which includes cowra lithgow mudgee oberon blayney and rylstone
9394762 the bmsc believes that rather than suggesting a 10 bed reduction for our new facility an increase in the number of maternity and paediatric beds should be proposed especially since plans for the ambulatory care unit are still under a cloud
9394763 in any case urgent recruitment initiatives together with moves to create more attractive working conditions for nurses would seem to be the more appropriate response
9394764 we and the community relied upon gwahs to plan and fund safe staffing levels appropriate to the expected demands on its facilities
9394765 the health minister and our local member promised that the shortcomings would be rectified they did not endorse that the beds ought to be mothballed surged or closed
9394766 am i really enjoying this or should i keep on working to get my 10 000 kills for the seriously achievement
9394767 oh i unlock all the secrets of ff im hardcore
9394768 a n00b is someone who plays video games for less than 15 hours a day
9394769 losercore someone who games so much that they lose sight of reality
9394770 if you understand what im saying and you disagree thats fine i just then wonder wth i am if the bar is set so low for hardcore gamers
9394771 hardcores need to learn to get along the fact is without casuals gaming would plummet
9394772 hardcore then why are you on here fighting about it and not playing your games
9394773 the presidential experience bar differs for liberal men and women in general
9394774 the media should not know when or where we meet or who takes part in our programs before or after a meeting
9394775 just a group of conservatives who meet and talk together
9394776 were seeing a whole new generation of leaders coming up
9394777 we allowed ourselves to be divided we were split before the battle began
9394778 to any critics who say a woman cant think and work and carry a baby at the same time id just like to escort that neanderthal back to the cave
9394779 liberal left males continue to sink into taliban like muck
9394780 take off our republican hats and put on our america hats
9394781 refrain from any political rhetoric that would be traditional on the opening day of the convention
9394782 there are a lot of smart talented people with institutional knowledge who are working backstage and thats beneficial to us
9394783 i think there was a lot of concern about the optics
9394784 it has a phone bank area conference rooms and a computer area weve just got a lot more space here
9394785 after 28 years of hard work and dedication its time to take a permanent vacation
9394786 so please join us in wishing him the very best as he heads home to foster for a well deserved rest
9394787 its believed there was some type of disturbance outside of the home between partygoers and unknown suspects who drove to the area
9394788 i didnt buy any clothes i brought my old stuff
9394789 i packed all my good clothes and this was my last shirt
9394790 i went to bjs and got more snacks than you can imagine
9394791 the call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties
9394792 i also think its an important part of teaching your children that food doesnt come from a box in the store
9394793 they are opposed to it primarily because they believe its incompatible
9394794 a concern was raised by the planning and zoning board whats next pygmy goats where do you draw the line
9394795 i have a really strong tongu score april 2007 120 photos of natalie fiore french score and voluptuous models are non existent so natalie is a woman all of france should be
9394796 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9394797 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention to act as americans not republicans because america needs us now no matter whether we are republican or democrat
9394798 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans we have to join the 300 million other americans on behalf of our fellow citizens its a time for action so were going to suspend most of our activities tomorrow except for those absolutely necessary
9394799 tomorrows program will be business only and will refrain from any political rhetoric that would be traditional in an opening session of a convention
9394800 we zijn geen voorstander van sancties en zien dit als een laatste uitweg
9394801 maar als het nodig is kunnen wij ook maatregelen nemen
9394802 op geen moment is er het voornemen uitgesproken het verongelukte vliegtuig te vervangen
9394803 the japans defense ministry will on monday invite military attaches from foreign embassies to brief them on the defense white paper and will get final approval at the cabinet meeting slated for friday
9394804 the issues of japanese territory kuril islands and takeshima the japanese name for dokdo are still pending
9394805 if human society is equal nobody complains but if there is unjustifiable inequality many people complain a family would not be happy if the head of the household preferred one child over another only if there is no discrimination in society or state can we avoid conflict the monk said some workplaces allegedly do not give jobs to those with different ideologies or religions how tragic that is he said i hope that the spirit of the buddhist rally last wednesday will be kept up peacefully
9394806 during a dinner hosted for chinese president hu jintao cheong wa dae invited the christian broadcasting system cbs childrens choir to perform this means it paid no attention to the appeals of 200 000 buddhist believers nationwide

9394819 unexpectedly for some members of the working group there were serious difficulties in reaching common agreement on the content of article 21 concerning adoption delegates of states with an islamic culture had problems accepting the proposed text because adoption is not recognized in those countries moreover a delegate from a latin american state kept blocking a consensus by making statements on financial gain for persons or institutions that act as brokers in intercountry adoptions
9394820 state parties that recognize and or permit the system of adoption
9394821 we only talk about childrens rights what about our rights on our children
9394822 state parties shall respect the responsibilities rights and duties of parents or where applicable the members of the extended family or community as provided for by local custom legal guardians or other persons legally responsible for the child to provide in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present convention

9394830 maxis has been bringing the latest and most popular entertainment to malaysians and rewarding our customers by bringing the experience beyond television into live exclusive experiences
9394831 i have not contravened any established law that would warrant my being banished from the land there is no law that says one must one must not marry more than four wives
9394832 all my wives are with children and some of these are people i have married and stayed with for over 30 years how can they expect me to leave them within two days
9394833 weve made up bundles of supplies with rice sugar matches and candles
9394834 since the government has unable to provide for these people weve decided to step in
9394835 when it started rising further i knew it was time to leave we packed a few things quickly and placed the rest of our belongings on high shelves in our home
9394836 then we fled god knows if my house is still standing
9394837 we hadnt eaten a proper meal in four days my children were crying every day at least here weve had some hot food
9394838 old people whose children left them behind i was lucky my sons love me
9394839 weve lived off our land and thats the only way well survive but how do we go back when everything is under water what will we do swim
9394840 they should be here taking charge instead theyve left it to us
9394841 if treasurer wayne swan wants to have competition in the sector dont allow that merger because it will reduce competition
9394842 heres some advice i wish i would have got when i was your age live every week like its shark week

9394845 despite the smaller allocation we received strong support from the private sector like petronas and tenaga nasional berhad as well as those in the banking sector including ambank group and maybank
9394846 every malaysian should mark the nations most important day by gathering together to witness the annual parade
9394847 we dont need a fireworks display or a grand pageant to mark the day just a little thought is important
9394848 when i was deputy prime minister and finance minister i made sure i visited perma tang pauh on weekends and had programmes throughout the day to meet the people
9394849 the reality of course is that its been the driest season the driest year on record for a long long time
9394850 i met a villager who told me he was poor because kuala lumpur had taken away sabahs 20 points there are no points that kl has taken away i pity people who are fed with lies like these we do not want our people to be misled
9394851 all problems and challenges that we face can be overcome if we want to solve them and if we work hard
9394852 sabah leaders can help bring progress but they must be dedicated and honest dont say that kl has taken the 20 points away
9394853 i hope sabah parties can come up with policies to change our mindset
9394854 we need a revolution but by revolution i do not mean going against kuala lumpur
9394855 it is going to become very tough for us to defend them
9394856 now after all the praising you condemn and embarrass the prime minister in doing so not only are you being inconsistent and dishonest you are also misleading the people
9394857 the people will ask what sort of game you are playing it is not as if they have a poor memory of what you have said
9394858 the most important question mr mccain should have asked himself about ms palin was not whether she could help him win the presidency it was whether she is qualified and prepared to serve as president should anything prevent him from doing so
9394859 she didnt look pregnant at seven months so it had to be her daughters baby
9394860 his judgment is awful and inconsistent and his inexperience is why
9394861 lack of experience at the bottom of the ticket is a far different thing than lack of experience at the top
9394862 if barack obama was as qualified as sarah palin he would be a great candidate for vice president as well
9394863 palins lack of foreign policy experience is going to hold sway over mccains in his administration
9394864 does everybody just forget obamas working with both lugar and coburn on nuclear non proliferation and ethics reform respectively
9394865 when asked later if youd support the surge if you knew that things would improve after its implementation and you say
9394866 you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances
9394867 the pirates with money to burn appear to have become beacons of hope for many young men who are desperate for work in one of the planets poorest countries
9394868 these youths who used to work as bodyguards or in the government militia see the lucrative rewards which are available at sea and decide to enlist in the pirate gangs a vicious cycle is born
9394869 the pirates favourite choice of currency is us dollars and the method of payment is normally in cash deposits into bank accounts are discouraged as paperwork and records mean a trail will be left behind
9394870 the first and immediate priority during negotiations is the safety of the hostages
9394871 we also call on the police to conduct a thorough investigation into the racist and seditious statement by ahmad
9394872 were are still waiting but the processing of our requests is still very slow
9394873 even when we get our letter of approval for the subsidised diesel quotas were not given the amount that we request for
9394874 i cant understand why the government is taking such a long time to complete its study on our request
9394875 it should consider the fact that people do not mind paying almost double the normal fares demanded by ticket touts on weekends this shows they can definitely afford to pay a bit more for our service
9394876 the malaysian ship is being sailed towards eyl where another six vessels are held
9394877 the pirates are increasing dramatically in numbers and in strength
9394878 we found out that the pirates have no interest in dealing with the country but will deal with the shipowners which is misc
9394879 the public and grassroots are not so much interested in politics as they are in bread and butter issues we have an important role to play in bn and will focus on supporting our acting president in improving the economy and racial ties from within the coalition
9394880 our party put all our eggs in one basket the basket that was penang fell so now the leaders are looking at the federal territory as the new basket
9394881 they cwc know that the majority of the kuala lumpur gerakan leaders are dr tans kee kwong loyalists they sympathise with his decision to take up pakatan rakyats offer and many of them even object to his suspension
9394882 many of the leaders are also jealous that pakatan seems to be achieving many of gerakans goals in a short time they are beginning to see that gerakan may be better off with the opposition than bn as a result the cwc is worried of this and has decided to cold storage them
9394883 we believe in gerakan its ideology and its history our hope is that the top leadership will consider moving out of bn we hope to convince them at the national delegates conference in october
9394884 if not more of us might join dr tan datuk dr toh kin woon and datuk lee kah choon in quitting the party
9394885 we need a very large sum of money to put in place basic infrastructure that people in other parts of the state take for granted
9394886 im keeping my fingers crossed for a sizeable chunk of the rm3 3 billion and a better life for my people
9394887 i know i am assured some allocation i just hope to get more than what i expect
9394888 its a rough and bumpy ride in ulu lubai ulu pandaruan long napir and upper limbang
9394889 this is logging road country during the dry season you have to cope with the dust
9394890 during the rainy season the roads become slippery and there is the danger of landslides
9394891 when are you going to give us water electricity and roads
9394892 people here are still wondering when they can enjoy travelling on tarred roads have uninterrupted clean and safe water supply or have electricity at any time of the day
9394893 the deluge of requests is such that sometimes i tidak tahan cant take it anymore
9394894 my wife works shifts and we dont get much time to be together
9394895 this is one of the activities that brings us and our six children closer
9394896 i have also learnt about it from books and studied agricultural science during my schooldays
9394897 we responded to the governments call for people to plant their own vegetables a long time ago
9394898 and with the present cost of food items we can save money and get fresh produce from our garden
9394899 we the state government always control our spending although we are facing a lot of financial problems and we never misspend
9394900 we sent the list to aim but to date none of the candidates had received loans
9394901 it should be transparent by releasing the list we want to know why aim is not giving poor indians a chance to benefit from its micro financing services
9394902 his voice sounded different when he told me the pirates asked for rm10 million to release him and other crew members he sounded nervous
9394903 he also told me the negotiation on the release was still on going but he did not mention with whom they were dealing with
9394904 he told me that at the moment he and other crew members were still in the vessel waiting for the result of the negotiation
9394905 however the proceedings are not affected as the quorum is 26
9394906 it is not politically motivated and has nothing to do with anwar the government has been working on this for years
9394907 i didnt panic i kept my composure and worked out what i did wrong
9394908 the first few seconds after you jump feel like a vacuum like youre completely weightless after about five seconds you would feel the force of the wind building and have to open your parachute
9394909 aspiring jumpers have to practise sky diving first master the controlling of parachutes as they are everything for a base jumper
9394910 it was really fun to march and play in front of the king queen and other vips we dont feel tired at all
9394911 the practice did not affect our studies as we planned our schedule well
9394912 i was on the other side of the old court building so i did not see much
9394913 he is very good compared with the younger workers he knows how to get more rubbish with one sweep without losing the broom leaves
9394914 i was invited twice to do the commercial and i thought maybe i should do my part to promote the local arts
9394915 im really happy and grateful this is the opportunity for me to step forward in the international arena
9394916 i pictured myself as the character because im really keen to know about our history and past leaders
9394917 i starting taking a serious interest in art when i was 24 years old
9394918 for a long time we artists had to face a lot of difficulties because the interest wasnt there but things have changed
9394919 i was surprised when the national art gallery told me they wanted to send me to the camp it was a great experience
9394920 if i win the state youth chief post i will go for a high position in the wing in the october party elections
9394921 this will be an interesting battle which will decide mcas fate in the state once and for all
9394922 hee leong is younger than his opponent and has a lot of grassroots support while heng is a well known senator who raised national issues at the senate
9394923 i guess its just nice to play well pretty simple
9394924 this is probably the most intimidating court in the world if youve never been on it before
9394925 my mom told me that i am losing a little bit of weight
9394926 im actually not losing weight im just getting firmer you know
9394927 i keep raising the number because it just keeps holding better than expected
9394928 this is kind of an inauspicious end to a really incredible summer
9394929 hurricane gustav is the fault of john mccains vp pick sarah palin extremist conservatives like sarah palin have ignored environmental warnings about coastal erosion climate change and the importance of mangroves and have tried to stop the progress that would halt unnatural hurricane events like this
9394930 evidentemente no quiero torturar a ning n prisionero hay una larga lista de temas en los que no estamos de acuerdo
9394931 bueno para m el ahogamiento simulado es una tortura la administraci n ha defendido el ahogamiento simulado y de acuerdo con un informe publicado ha sido usado
9394932 es s lo un paso para la verdadera reconstrucci n social de la provincia y los dem s lugares afectados
9394933 es un momento en el que la mayor parte de nuestros pol ticos estan entregados a otras tareas
9394934 todos los actos ser n considerados opcionales a partir de ma ana a las 17
9394935 no quiero que mi visita impida en cualquier sentido la respuesta de nuestro personal de emergencia
9394936 es un momento en el que la mayor parte de nuestros pol ticos estan entregados a otras tareas
9394937 todos los actos ser n considerados opcionales a partir de ma ana a las 17
9394938 no quiero que mi visita impida en cualquier sentido la respuesta de nuestro personal de emergencia
9394939 no tenemos por qu ceder a los caprichos de la delincuencia yucat n es un estado seguro y as lo mantendremos con el respaldo de los cuerpos de seguridad
9394940 i am not going to take the blame for this i am going to put a stop to this nonsense before it even starts
9394941 shes got the right judgment she doesnt think like senator obama does that iran is a minor irritant
9394942 shes been a commander in chief of the alaska national guard
9394943 the experience that she comes from is with what shes done in the government
9394944 and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9394945 john mccains judgment is once again put at issue because hes chosen somebody who clearly doesnt meet the national security threshold who is not ready to be president tomorrow
9394946 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9394947 our forces are ready to take the security responsibility tomorrow monday
9394948 they are controlling the situation our troops are on alert to avert any failure of the transfer
9394949 we are happy that iraqi forces will be in control now of the security rather than the foreign troops that is how it should be iraqis should protect the iraqis
9394950 our forces are not ready to take responsibility for the situation i am sorry to say but there is lot of corruption in our security forces
9394951 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
9394952 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9394953 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9394954 i was worried about the kids we just couldnt stay
9394955 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9394956 theres a real possibility of flooding storm surge and high winds do not put yourself in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9394957 need to understand that in a storm of this size there is serious risk of significant flooding
9394958 we cant accept the world order where all decisions are made by one nation even by such serious and authoritative nation as the united states such a world would be unstable and prone to conflicts
9394959 russia today has found itself more isolated than the soviet union ever was
9394960 we will provide all kinds of assistance to these republics
9394961 these international agreements will spell out our obligations on providing support and assistance economic social humanitarian and military
9394962 we arent going to impose any restrictions we will fulfill our contract obligations
9394963 but we will expand and diversify our opportunities in exporting hydrocarbons the global economy and particularly the rapidly growing pacific region need that
9394964 this is a time when we have to do away with party politics and act as americans
9394965 i will take off my republican hat and put on my american hat were going to suspend most of our activities except those that are absolutely necessary i hope and pray we will be able to resume some of our normal operations as quickly as possible
9394966 had the bush administration not let this city new orleans drown essentially we wouldnt be talking about it
9394967 given the reluctance at virtually all levels to openly engage with the unprecedented scale of both current emissions and their associated growth rates even an optimistic interpretation of the current framing of climate change implies that stabilisation much below 650ppm is improbable
9394968 we are certainly not on track for a two degree temperature increase at the moment we are much more on track for a three to four degree temperature increase and we need to be thinking about what that actually means
9394969 the big systems of the world start to go wrong when you get beyond two degrees
9394970 certainly if theres not a good result at copenhagen the two degree target will look impossible
9394971 theres 18 months of optimism to hold on to if by copenhagen it hasnt been addressed then it will look very bleak indeed
9394972 the position of the management of zoom is that that is not an accurate reflection of the debts of the company we dont know how this figure has been arrived at
9394973 our estimate is that its likely to be in the 20 25 million category but its not possible for anyone at this time to give a definitive figure
9394974 in an economic downturn the levy of stamp duty particularly for the purchase of affordable housing is an obstacle even for households earning modest incomes
9394975 the devolvement of stamp duty would allow the scottish government the opportunity to implement and monitor more appropriate and fairer levels of stamp duty
9394976 scotlands distinct housing market and the different income and affordability levels in scotland make the devolution of stamp duty a common sense proposal
9394977 the ability to set conditions for the scottish market according to scotlands needs rather than have stamp duty based on levels of income and affordability in england would allow the scottish government to adjust stamp duty to meet scotlands concerns
9394978 this is a really important debate by devolving stamp duty to the scottish parliament you tackle the problem which tweed homes have highlighted
9394979 even though we dont have the evidence there are things you can do which are positive that cannot do harm and can only can do good
9394980 what have i done to my baby ive been slapping on the body cream
9394981 you need to be scared you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9394982 this storm is so powerful that im not sure weve seen anything like it this is the real deal this is not a test so anyone out there thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that would be the biggest mistake of your life
9394983 im not worried about it because i have asked god to let the storm go back out to sea because i think we have been through enough tragedy and hardship im just surviving this time on faith
9394984 what do i do if i leave where do i go guess if i have to ill just jump on that old bicycle of mine pedal damn fast and pray
9394985 people are really scared when they see this thing on the weather channel once you have experienced being in the water you dont want to experience it again but on the other hand a lot of people are just tired of being away from home in shelters
9394986 if the church leaves its like the captain abandoning his ship
9394987 well take with us what we saved last time but thats not much mainly photos this new house has been our prized baby we dont want to come back and see what we saw with katrina
9394988 the general consensus here is the mayor is covering his back after the colossal muck up over katrina
9394989 if you are stubborn enough if you are not taking this as seriously as we need you to take it and if you decide to stay you are on your own
9394990 make sure you have an axe because you will be carving your way out of your attic to get on your roof with waters that will be surrounding you
9394991 needs must and it would be a minor evil remember money is short and venice is falling apart
9394992 nothing has been agreed formally but there is a way round the bylaws which would allow us to install the advertising screens which would allow the possibility of raising much needed money to pay for restoration the subject material of the advertising on the screens would be carefully considered and proposals would be submitted and then considered before being given the go ahead we cant have just anything promoted on st marks square
9394993 it is not a question of deciding whether the screens are ugly or beautiful but to recognise the fact that they are needed even in st marks square
9394994 i thought it was hilarious in a way when i found out theyd banned it but i also felt bad for my fans who had sent in their pictures in good faith who wont get to see them now
9394995 it is absolutely outrageous for a public representative to be pictured with an ak 47 assault rifle
9394996 the snp disciplinary committee might have refused to dump jahangir hanif but ultimately it will be the voters who decide his future
9394997 we can no longer live we cant be safe anywhere
9394998 i hope those in government do their jobs otherwise they should resign
9394999 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive
9395000 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9395001 we need to be on stage we need to show our country we need to dance for our country
9395002 we want to show who we are what we do and that art is something else we can talk about
9395003 people need a sense of community in times of both peace and strife if this can be promoted then it means they are less likely to kill each other
9395004 i was a bit surprised but delighted at how popular the dance programme was with everyone
9395005 dorian gray is a known story so people can relate to it but i realised how he had actually made it very much a statement about our times which could embrace both american psycho and david beckham
9395006 i loved coke i never did a lot just a little bit at parties
9395007 he was hiding in south america and living off the proceeds of being a cocaine baron
9395008 and i read that in the paper and all the cards fell into place and i saw how my little sniff of cocaine at a party had an absolute direct route to this f horrible man in south america and from that day i never touched cocaine again
9395009 until that moment i had never grasped the full horrifying structure of what brings coke to our parties in britain
9395010 marijuana grown in the back garden is not the same as cocaine obviously
9395011 i hated it marijuana dope always made me feel miserable and paranoid and unhappy and i woke up one day and thought no more of that thank you
9395012 its a miracle shes never gone mad she is a remarkable person who has achieved an amazing thing with a life she neither chose for herself nor particularly wanted
9395013 shes never put on weight never got anorexic never gone mad
9395014 she said hello its lovely to meet you and that was about it other than horsey chat
9395015 no you couldnt do that in those days its such a tricky area isnt it especially if there is no violence i mean look at mike tyson i dont think he was a rapist
9395016 i dont think she can have that man into court under those circumstances
9395017 i was date raped yes a couple of times not with excessive violence or being hit but rather being locked in a room and made to have sex against my will
9395018 despite their claims the supermarkets all still have a long way to go to help customers choose a healthier diet
9395019 this ill informed report will not distract us from our work with the fsa and department of health on tackling obesity work for which uk retailers are recognised as european leaders
9395020 its six months out of date contains a number of inaccuracies and is a largely subjective assessment which ignores the focus we place on fresh food in all our stores it is not an accurate or useful guide for customers
9395021 when africa dried to grassy plains groups of animals would stay close to their local source of water and groups would have become separated by large distances across the plains we believe this separation played a key role in the evolution of many of the species we recognise today
9395022 modern day climate change could break up water networks like it did millions of years ago
9395023 police were called at about 11 45pm on saturday to st thomass place in hackney to reports of a male assaulted local officers and paramedics attended
9395024 the victim a 14 year old boy was taken to an east london hospital suffering a single stab wound to the stomach he was pronounced dead at 8 12am on sunday
9395025 we believe we know the identity of the deceased but await formal identification before naming him next of kin have been informed
9395026 a female believed to be aged about 16 was also found at the scene with slash wounds she was taken to hospital where she remains in a stable condition it is believed the two victims had been involved in an altercation with a group of youths prior to being assaulted
9395027 there will be a bit of i dotting and t crossing
9395028 were proceeding with the campaign as planned but were trying to be flexible
9395029 the green shift has attracted a lot of interest but my own personal view is itll be who can best handle the economy
9395030 anybody can steer a ship in calm seas but this government got rid of the 3 billion contingency fund theyve spent us into a deficit
9395031 have gone back to the drawing board to revisit the platform to make sure that its costed appropriately
9395032 who wants to hear from a party that comes to power and says oh jeez we didnt know the cupboard was bare
9395033 do we want a control freak like harper as a prime minister or do we want somebody who can surround himself and be a team player
9395034 its a little nerve wracking making the plans in the uncertain climate that were in
9395035 i wouldnt put it past him but so be it canadians will judge him for what he does and what he says
9395036 it is a bloc of 45 countries there are diverse views and some of them find the clean exemption letting india circumvent the non proliferation regime hard to grant we cant accept extraneous conditions or prescriptions the tenets of the july 18 2005 indo us joint statement issued after the george bush manmohan singh meeting on the deal should be honoured
9395037 there is no question of change cosmetic or otherwise there are certain issues which have been drawn in red lines because those are the commitments which have been made by our pm this is what we have said in parliament these red lines are sacrosanct and if these are not met we cant endorse the agreement
9395038 the prime minister made certain commitments to parliament and he is bound by that
9395039 there is inspired talk about incorporating the uss wishes in the draft through semantic jugglery this is not a work of diplomatic finesse its a hard driven bargain and it will be subject to close scrutiny by the left and the bjp especially the former there is no way we can pull wool over their eyes everything will be spelt out in black and white
9395040 we expect the number of evacuees to increase until they can no longer fly anymore or there are no more passengers
9395041 most people are interested in watching tv because they are obviously concerned about whats going on back home
9395042 we had some people who came in late friday night who said
9395043 if people need long term relocation assistance we will have people from social services working to help them find housing
9395044 they will initially go to a staging area outside of the storms path and then receive their assignments
9395045 even without a direct hit new orleans could be in real danger
9395046 typically the northeast side of a hurricane receives the brunt of the damage southeast winds from gustav could pile the water into lake pontchartrain and the mississippi river flooding and tornado warnings will be in effect
9395047 including the period of making the required arrangements and winding up
9395048 creating misunderstandings which led to controversy and agitation and the loss of many precious lives
9395049 some militants have recently infiltrated jammu and there was a threat to people joining a rally
9395050 it is intriguing that the government has not specified the yatra duration but what is more disturbing is that the land has been virtually handed over to the board by giving it user rights our co ordination committee is meeting and will issue a statement
9395051 the government shall set aside for use by the board exclusively the land at baltal the proprietary status ownership title of the land shall not undergo any change
9395052 all cases of non serious nature linked to the jammu protests which shall mean bailable and compoundable will be withdrawn
9395053 the remaining cases will be reviewed on the merits of each case by a committee headed by anil goswami principal secretary home within 60 days till the completion of this process no action will be taken in such cases
9395054 a working group led by the chief secretary will address all compensation issues relating to both jammu and kashmir divisions
9395055 it was unbelievable the plot would not have fetched me much more than rs 2 5 lakh two years ago before the tatas set up shop
9395056 she is fighting for farmers and its good to see the crowd before her dais
9395057 i am thankful to tata for the money i have got
9395058 three years ago there were hardly any buyers of fertile land here but things have changed farmers who had never thought of selling their land are getting tempted by the price rise and are benefiting from it too
9395059 we get 20 per cent commission from the buyers many local brokers have turned rich overnight they have built houses and bought cars
9395060 i used to grow two rice crops a year but we are childless and my wife and i are growing old we need ready cash for an emergency others too have sold their land in the past one year
9395061 we split the rs 20 lakh we received as commission
9395062 joymollah is now known as the village of land brokers
9395063 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9395064 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9395065 i was trying to get situated at home i was trying to get things so it would be halfway safe
9395066 youre torn do you leave it and worry about it or do you stay and worry about living
9395067 theres really no place to go all the hotels are booked up to little rock and beyond
9395068 if we flood again were goners i dont think were coming back
9395069 i think for people who havent left they really are die hards because theyre taking their lives in their hands
9395070 i cant see any reason why a person staring down the barrel of a category 3 or category 4 hurricane would want to see if they can try to outfox mother nature thats taking an awful risk with yourself and your family
9395071 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our backyard
9395072 weve been playing good all year i think especially to split the series here in chicago against the cubs at home i think it says a lot
9395073 why is it frustrating why should it be are we supposed to win every day i dont think so
9395074 listen if we could get guys in every time we got men on base wed be 162 0 and thats not going to happen
9395075 what the hell am i supposed to be not ok
9395076 in any situation if you can minimize damage and limit it to singles it forces them to have to hit the ball more often to score runs and they scored two
9395077 i wasnt here in the past so i dont really know if he had a lack of dedication in the past
9395078 i mean i know what i read and i know what circulates in nfl circles
9395079 but when we sat down coming here we said were going to give this guy every benefit of the doubt and hes got to show us that he is dedicated and hes done everything that weve asked him to do and we feel very good about our decision to extend him
9395080 you guys see it out there we see it out there
9395081 hes done an excellent job in the weight room the meeting room hes come out there and hes jumped out at us on tape he looks good in the preseason so everything weve seen since we got here hes done everything weve asked him to do
9395082 to come back and clear my name is important to me
9395083 hes shown us that he can play so we didnt want him to make the free agent market
9395084 he accomplished a no hitter and wasnt given what he deserved that should have been a no hitter
9395085 thats a stinking no hitter we all got cheated from i feel horrible for cc
9395086 thats a joke that wasnt even close whoever the scorekeeper was absolutely denied major league baseball a nice no hitter right there
9395087 they threw hit up on the board even before laroche hit the bag thats a play cc makes easily throws him out by 10 feet to me its a no brainer
9395088 the way the ball came off the bat it was spinning and it went to the left of the mound with a left handed pitcher going to get it its a difficult play
9395089 the definition requires standard effort and that would have taken more than an ordinary effort the runner was well down the line
9395090 the ball was still rolling and i probably should have picked it up with my glove we probably wouldnt be having this conversation
9395091 i think if i pick it up with my glove i get him
9395092 id like to think it was a hit from a selfish standpoint id like it to be a hit but you could make a case either way but im hitting 160 i need every hit i can get
9395093 hes been dominant since he came over and hopefully he and rest of the team will take us to the promised land
9395094 in many respects sen obama reminds me of president clinton
9395095 we cant afford much more there i think weve got pretty good depth still at both spots if youre thinking about trying to finish out the season but much more trouble there and we might really get thin
9395096 he played the most snaps of the interior linemen and had the most production geno didnt play as many snaps but was probably as productive per play
9395097 oh yeah i dont think there would be any question about that
9395098 he knows it could be a blessing in the long run if he rehabs well and gets maybe even in better condition than he was this year so hes looking at the bright side right now
9395099 offensively it will be good to have clint back in the lineup
9395100 to tie mickey mantle youre speechless what do you say
9395101 its really hard to talk about because when you throw mickey mantles name around thats probably one of the greatest home run hitters of all time
9395102 but i think hes worried more about us winning than his milestones
9395103 there wasnt one guy in here that didnt want him up at that point
9395104 im trying to get ahead with my fastball hes trying to hit a home run
9395105 im not going to change my game plan neither is he
9395106 then he got comfortable and started throwing that breaking ball
9395107 it goes without saying but john is an all time great safety one of the leagues classiest professionals and his elite play speaks for itself
9395108 as has been the case in other situations i would not rule anything out down the road
9395109 i have no regrets about my time thus far with the patriots
9395110 the immense respect that ive long held for the organization has been only heightened over the past couple of weeks i am going to keep all options open and look forward with excitement to see what the future brings
9395111 the challenge that weve had is that the liberals since releasing their carbon tax plan have been pursuing a very different path than the government
9395112 so were glad that mr dion has agreed to meet but were not terribly optimistic agreement will be found
9395113 i will ask stephen harper face to face to explain why he is in such a rush to violate the spirit of his own fixed election date legislation i will ask him to explain why he wants to break his word yet again
9395114 una herida por asta de toro en el tercio medio de muslo izquierdo con orificio de entrada de cinco cent metros que presenta tres trayectorias ascendentes una hacia fuera de quince cent metros que contunde y diseca arteria vena y nervio femoral en unos cinco cent metros arrancando colaterales venosos otra hacia la regi n crural de unos veinticinco cent metros que parte y desgarra el abductor mayor y una ltima hacia adentro de unos trece cent metros que a trav s de abductor medio llega a la cara posterior interna shock traum tico pron stico muy grave
9395115 in my mind it was so clear and so obvious that something had to be done
9395116 its been a long difficult year a lot of things have happened a lot of things are going on but we managed to pull through this one means a lot and this one is also for you paul
9395117 we did what we did because it was a pretty easy call
9395118 he had a tremendous run out of turn 12 and helio crossed over almost the entire width of the track to impede the progress of the car behind him
9395119 if the infantry are out on the ground then the dogs and handlers are out there in front of them making sure its okay to go ahead theyre basically saving lives
9395120 this is asymmetric warfare with the enemy hitting us with improvised explosive devices
9395121 theres nothing out there that can find those things as quickly and efficiently as a dog can technology isnt as good in this environment
9395122 with dogs if they dont like it they wont do it
9395123 you cant force a dog to work some dogs get to afghanistan find they cant handle the heat and have to be sent home
9395124 theyre out there saving lives and all theyre really after is a ball
9395125 its not likely that there will be any update until probably monday after some initial treatments and therapy
9395126 you see one of the guys go down and you hope hes all right
9395127 chris is a tough guy i hope its not serious you hate to see a guy of his caliber laying on the ground
9395128 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9395129 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9395130 as i handed the ball back he didnt even grab the ball
9395131 i didnt know what to expect didnt know what he did he went down and he was in some serious pain
9395132 hes our guy it would hurt to not have him but weve got lots of guys behind him that can do well
9395133 chris told me to just make sure to hold onto the ball
9395134 russia does not want confrontation with any country russia does not plan to isolate itself
9395135 everyone should understand that if someone launches an aggressive sortie he will receive a response
9395136 europe can do a lot starting with sending a mission of civilian monitors which would lead to an international peacekeeping mechanism that would replace the presence of russian troops
9395137 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9395138 europe would only be hurting itself if we were to get full of emotion and slam all the doors shut to the rooms that we will want to enter afterwards
9395139 stop well short of any action that might escalate into a damaging tit for tat sequence of economic and political sanctions
9395140 listeriosis poses a very low risk to the general population since healthy people rarely become ill when exposed to the bacteria
9395141 those most at risk include pregnant women the very old the very young and those with weakened immune systems
9395142 this is a time when we have to do away with party politics and we have to act as americans
9395143 we have to join the 300 million other americans on behalf of our fellow citizens its a time for action
9395144 this is the culmination of his political career so obviously he is going to do everything he can but obviously too were not going to do anything that would be deemed inappropriate
9395145 all the generous people that are here into charitable fund raisers
9395146 communications among first responders are still not quite at the level we would seek
9395147 but i can also tell you that the level of co operation between the federal government the state governments and local governments in louisiana and in the other affected states is excellent and i have every confidence that we will not see any of the mistakes of katrina repeated
9395148 we can activate an e mail list of a couple million people who want to give back
9395149 were going to try to stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then well probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible
9395150 somebody could see that and think that maybe its something they should do
9395151 to get that many people to volunteer to serve is amazing it feels like a family deal
9395152 i had through shri partha chatterjee suggested that a person with no political or industrial affiliations be invited to act as an unbiased intermediator in the matter he or she can go into the demand articulated by you and give carefully thought out findings for the earnest consideration of all sides if this thought is acceptable to you please suggest a name or names i would request the state government to respond positively
9395153 back channel talks are already on another interlocutor will only muddy the situation
9395154 if my suggestion is acted upon i could urge that the status quo on the sites belonging to the owners unwilling to part with them be maintained even as you give pause to the agitation until the intermediators recommendation becomes available and hopefully leads to a solution
9395155 so many holdings have been merged that it is difficult to earmark which area belongs to the unwilling farmer and which to the willing
9395156 we will have no problem if 10 to 15 acres out of 400 acres are to be given for the main project
9395157 if nancy pelosis leadership leads to projects and programs that are beneficial to the 2nd congressional district i would support her
9395158 i think it would be presumptuous for me to say yeah im going to give blanket support to nancy pelosi not knowing who might be running against her
9395159 generally most 2nd district democrats do not fit in that mold of the national democratic party
9395160 that is what david boswell has to bring out that he will not be a d c thinking democrat
9395161 one side believes that they can do a better job for your family and your money than you can
9395162 the other side my side believes you can do a better job with your money
9395163 that gets blown right off the table when youve got a bridge that doesnt go anywhere
9395164 but the government takes a lot less of your money than it did a decade ago
9395165 people need to know that were important enough for him to come and talk to us for him to come and energize us
9395166 thats what we need and if he doesnt do it its certainly not going to help my race
9395167 and kentuckians are going to be very well treated at this convention
9395168 i remember when people found out what i was doing they were kidding me saying i cant wait to see how you thread that needle
9395169 we support accelerated exploration drilling and development in america from new oilfields off the nations coasts to onshore fields such as those in montana north dakota and alaska
9395170 doesnt thumb its nose at mccain and his position on the subject
9395171 i think the distinction some people make is that they arent fully convinced that maybe were not warming
9395172 i dont think theres skepticism that somethings going on which is why the climate change phrase is ok with them
9395173 sometimes parties are better at giving lip service to unity than showing unity
9395174 this whole section on environmental and energy policies was clearly action
9395175 youre going to see a unified theme that has to do with the fact that john mccain has put his country first and he has had a career of reform
9395176 he believes in peace and prosperity youre going to see those themes interwoven throughout the week
9395177 sen mccain appealed to me because i view myself as a moderate
9395178 i was pretty much undecided early on but as i gathered information and saw the delegates i became a big supporter of john mccain
9395179 and getting an opportunity to see our next president that gives me kind of chills just thinking about it
9395180 we should have left the place earlier with essential supplies running out we might starve if no fresh stocks are reached
9395181 i am not worried about the loss of property i am searching for my husband and three children missing since august 18 when floodwaters entered our village
9395182 no vamos a aceptar injerencias embajador en asuntos internos si usted viola los convenios internacionales tendr a que irse de este pa s no aceptaremos faltas de respeto tendr a que agarrar sus maletas y marcharse de venezuela as que mida mejor sus palabras excelent simo embajador
9395183 por cierto que l duddy estuvo hablando de la falta de colaboraci n de venezuela con la dea y de que no les informamos de los planes
9395184 y es que con el programa de entregas controladas que tienen que es una m scara se meten a trabajar dentro de las mafias y las mafias infiltran la dea
9395185 thats not the way mister no es la manera se or
9395186 quiere que le diga se or gringo d nde est n las siembras de marihuana vaya por california oregon washington eso no queda aqu en venezuela a lo mejor en el ba o de su oficina hay una siembra de marihuana vaya y vea bajo la poceta retrete revise a ver
9395187 como arma pol tica para tratar de chantajear a los gobiernos pero con nosotros eso no a va funcionarles y cada d a les va a funcionar menos en am rica latina
9395188 i guess its just nice to play well pretty simple
9395189 this is probably the most intimidating court in the world if youve never been on it before
9395190 my mom told me that i am losing a little bit of weight
9395191 im actually not losing weight im just getting firmer you know
9395192 it was one of my goals coming into this season next to trying to win wimbledon i missed that one oh well
9395193 its a goal but i want to win a grand slam
9395194 evidentemente la conducta de cada gobierno es lo que va a significar la forma en que estados unidos va a tratar a esos gobiernos
9395195 como hay un conocimiento por parte del senador mccain sobre las realidades del hemisferio por el continente americano sin duda eso va a conllevar a una relaci n m s estrecha con nuestros amigos como m xico como colombia como chile per los otros gobiernos muy amigos que tiene estados unidos
9395196 est consciente que tenemos enemigos en este hemisferio y esa es otra diferencia con el candidato dem crata a la presidencia barack obama
9395197 hay una diferencia entre rusia y georgia hay una diferencia entre ch vez y uribe mccain conoce esas diferencias obama evidentemente no
9395198 mccain est consciente de que ch vez es una amenaza para todo el hemisferio que ch vez est financiando elementos desestabilizadores a trav s de todo el hemisferio hay que contrarrestar los esfuerzos de ch vez por desestabilizar las democracias en el hemisferio a trav s de la utilizaci n del poder econ mico que tiene por el petr leo
9395199 gran parte del problema que tenemos con bolivia y con ecuador es esa utilizaci n por parte del se or ch vez de los recursos de venezuela para ir incrementando su influencia y su agenda antiamericana
9395200 es muy preocupante lo que estamos viendo en esos pa ses
9395201 habr a a n m s inter s por parte del presidente de estados unidos sobre el tema cubano sobre la necesidad de ayudar a la oposici n interna y a la sociedad civil
9395202 se mantendr a el enfoque sobre la necesidad de que se siga con la actual pol tica hasta que no haya una transici n democr tica en cuba encaminada a trav s de tres pasos
9395203 legalizaci n de todos los partidos la prensa y los sindicatos obreros
9395204 porque mccain considera que es irrespetuoso la forma en que el se or obama y el congreso dem crata han tratado a colombia
9395205 es irrespetuoso tratar a m xico dici ndole que ahora hay que renegociar el acuerdo de libre comercio con nuestro vecino m s cercano
9395206 adicionales a los programas que han existido eso conllevar a una mejor relaci n con el hemisferio
9395207 lo que buscamos es blindar la frontera con desarrollo producci n y paz
9395208 esto ha sacado a nuestra familias adelante de una manera m s segura
9395209 colombia ha dado la espalda a ecuador es corresponsable y no ha hecho nada
9395210 veinte no sonaba bien y diez tampoco fon ticamente hablando por supuesto
9395211 no he llevado la cuenta de mis amantes ten a 40 a os cuando conoc a mi marido por supuesto tengo un pasado
9395212 no es chocante lo chocante ser a pretender que no tengo ning n pasado
9395213 cuando le vi por primera vez entr en la habitaci n y algo ocurri su encanto
9395214 i thought a 66 or a 65 would be a great round
9395215 starting this year i decided to tell myself something similar to what vijay told himself last week that im a great putter and that im a lot better than people think and people write
9395216 so today was a good reflection and if you look at my putting stats for the year im one of the great putters on tour
9395217 its time to step it up and give a little kick on my butt and join them so ive been working on that
9395218 we cant accept the world order where all decisions are made by one nation even by such a serious and authoritative nation as the united states
9395219 such a world would be unstable and prone to conflicts
9395220 russia today has found itself more isolated than the soviet union ever was
9395221 it is still under control as only less than one per cent of the number of policemen throughout the country were nabbed by the aca
9395222 apart from the investigations carried out by the agency we will also conduct our own investigations
9395223 although this has saddened the force we still have to face this
9395224 we will not tolerate this kind of behaviour and will take action immediately against those who tarnish our image
9395225 we do not want the public to say bad things about us because of this it is a shame it has occurred as the police force is one of the top enforcement agencies in the country
9395226 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9395227 you would have thought the base was energized by being in a war if not perhaps we need a new base
9395228 we cant accept the world order where all decisions are made by one nation even by such serious and authoritative nation as the united states such a world would be unstable and prone to conflicts
9395229 russia today has found itself more isolated than the soviet union ever was
9395230 we will provide all kinds of assistance to these republics
9395231 these international agreements will spell out our obligations on providing support and assistance economic social humanitarian and military
9395232 we arent going to impose any restrictions we will fulfill our contract obligations
9395233 but we will expand and diversify our opportunities in exporting hydrocarbons the global economy and particularly the rapidly growing pacific region need that
9395234 this is still a big ugly storm still strong and i encourage everyone to leave
9395235 they defy the evacuation order because theyre afraid to leave their homes empty or cant stomach the indignity of being an evacuee
9395236 but most others have taken gustav as seriously as authorities are warning an unprecedented pre storm exodus thats based on the lessons learned from katrina get out and get out early
9395237 canadian forces medical personnel were on board to conduct a mass evacuation and assist u s medical personnel with any medical issues over there
9395238 i cant take a chance because so many people died in katrina
9395239 i was here for katrina and i was going to stay but this ones coming really bad and i decided to get out
9395240 the wind looks to be stronger this time im scared it will rip the roof off
9395241 it remains likely that gustav will prove to become a worse case scenario for the producing region and places the heart of the oil production region under a high risk of sustaining significant or major damage
9395242 no puedo decir concretamente cu nta gente a n est aislada por las inundaciones pero su n mero se cuenta en
9395243 necesitamos m s recursos m s barcas militares y esfuerzos de rescate para evacuarles
9395244 a partir de esta hora se desconoce el paradero del avi n

9395246 hemos enviado patrullas a pie y tenemos aviones que est n listos para realizar la b squeda pero lamentablemente el tiempo no est bueno
9395247 hes got the ability to concentrate and relax at the same time
9395248 and my evaluation was from what weve seen recently kip had been in better control than ramirez had obviously it didnt work out that way
9395249 in a tie game youve got to come in pumping strikes i was off and continued to stay off
9395250 when you give them the chance to get one hit and score multiple runs
9395251 hes got the ability to concentrate and relax at the same time
9395252 and my evaluation was from what weve seen recently kip had been in better control than ramirez had obviously it didnt work out that way

9395255 en su movimiento actual la afectaci n a cuba se mantendr aunque disminuyendo gradualmente bandas espirales de gustav continuar n afectando el occidente y el centro del pa s con chubascos lluvias y vientos fuertes

9395264 al principio comenzamos con una abertura redonda de manera natural porque coincide con la mitolog a china del c rculo como representaci n de la unidad y del cielo
9395265 lo que no pensamos fue lo del aspecto del sol naciente que se contempla desafortunadamente desde el punto de vista chino aunque lo entendimos
9395266 aunque la idea original era construir un gran c rculo para permitir al viento pasar a trav s del edificio la forma pod a cambiar y en realidad nos gusta m s ahora el dise o actual se ajusta mucho mejor a la estructura y a las funciones dentro y fuera de ella es mucho mejor para el edificio

9395270 me parece respetable cada cual tiene que tomar sus decisiones en la vida
9395271 since the shelf life of some of these points is awfully short i have admittedly small peeve about the obama campaigns initial and petty attack on palin and the coverage it received
9395272 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9395273 i have championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress
9395274 in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9395275 if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9395276 the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9395277 the money thats been appropriated for the project it should remain available for a link an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done
9395278 this link is a commitment to help ketchikan expand its access to help this community prosper
9395279 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9395280 she was asked about the bridge and she supported it
9395281 how could she have foreseen that she would be at this point now everybody is surprised by this development
9395282 conservatives love palin because she has a downs baby and an m 16
9395283 to the extent it is possible should be done after a legal process
9395284 statesmen listen to the advise of the supreme leader and
9395285 6 world powers to sit in front of us iran and we determine the conditions of the negotiations
9395286 today the enemy is expanding deviational movements and is propagating unbelief and such thoughts are close to the thoughts of the enemy and the devil the enemy is propagating drug abuse and immorality in the country or trying to propagate false mysticism and false sacred matters by the way of sending false prophets claiming to be the imam of the era or being in contact with the imam of the era i wonder how come they manage to make some people follow them
9395287 i dont even know if there are white people in detroit

9395307 of course when you become governor things come into much sharper focus than when you are a candidate
9395308 then she is forced to pay very close attention to the fiscal realities of it

9395336 russia doesnt want to engage in confrontation with anyone russia doesnt want to isolate itself
9395337 the partnership should not be the kind between the horseman and the horse but of two equal individuals

9395339 clearly we will be seeking to establish if it is the body of christopher foster
9395340 further tests are needed to establish whether the rifle found was the one used in the murder and to kill the animals
9395341 although this is now being treated as a murder we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances leading up to the incident
9395342 police continue to work around the clock to establish the facts on what happened at osbaston house that morning and our thoughts remain with the families of chris jill and kirstie foster
9395343 the events which have unfolded in our village this week have bewildered and stunned every one of us not only in this community but across the country
9395344 it is hard to grasp exactly what has happened and it is clearly going to be some time before everything is revealed but today we pray for the fosters and their family and friends who must be devastated by the events of early last tuesday morning
9395345 we are shocked absolutely shocked its not the sort of thing that occurs in a country district like this
9395346 its idyllic shropshire it doesnt happen here but it has happened here they the fosters had not been in the community long and were not pretty well known but nevertheless its a tremendous shock
9395347 just flipped because the pressure of it was too much for him
9395348 its anyones guess but it seems that the people he owed money to are big companies and i cant see them behind something like this
9395349 it remains our position that the army council must leave the stage and that the ira should no longer function in any respect
9395350 the ira have clearly gone off the stage since 2005 but attempts are still made by some people to drag them back on and i think thats silly
9395351 i would take the assurances that have been given both by the independent commission and by the government that the military activities of the pira have ceased i saw enough during my time seven years ago to convince me that sinn fein were determined to put the gun behind them and use a democratic process there is a worry from those dissident factions who still think that they can defeat the british government by terrorist means and achieve a united ireland they are a minority but remain dangerous
9395352 the security forces mi5 may go along with the lie for political expediency but ordinary people in northern ireland will know they will not go away
9395353 i dont believe ireland has seen its last ira murder

9395368 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9395369 we have laid the foundation for a comprehensive connection scheme of the human body the map helps us understand the functions of proteins and the complex processes in our cells
9395370 it is my decision and i will have to live with it
9395371 i have been watching these guys through the summer and ian is obviously a very determined guy i love his attitude and what he did at the british open er i mean the open championship where poulter finished second
9395372 he faldo wanted a team comprised mostly of youngsters who grew up watching him in his glory days and view him as a hero and in the likes of justin rose oliver wilson and poulter he will have such players
9395373 there were no signs of trauma or foul play dr
9395374 he was one of the nicest most down to earth guys i have ever met
9395375 proving that we can directly measure amyloid beta in the human brain is an important step forward for both clinical and basic research and that may be true not just in alzheimers disease but also in other serious neurological disorders
9395376 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
9395377 the results have potentially important clinical implications because the measurement of amyloid beta in the human brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well brain cells are communicating with each other even in very sick patients
9395378 if the results are validated in further studies this may assist physicians in making important patient management decisions in patients with acute neurological disorders
9395379 the new data fit well with the previous results in mice because improved neurological status is likely to go along with increased communication between brain cells
9395380 we havent measured how brain injury affects amyloid beta inside cells nor have we determined whether brain injury affects the ability of amyloid beta to form small aggregates that may be especially harmful
9395381 our ultimate goal is to develop interventions that we can apply after a traumatic brain injury to improve outcomes and reduce the long term risk of alzheimers
9395382 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
9395383 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
9395384 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
9395385 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
9395386 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
9395387 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
9395388 visually mediated motor planning in the escape response of drosophila

9395394 efforts are needed now to adapt the current price of the vaccines so they meet what individual countries can afford the solution may be tiered pricing according to gross national income per capita and according to the scale of country efforts
9395395 this new era of cervical cancer presents many opportunities and challenges ahead there is now realistic hope for controlling this disease where the toll is the highest and we have to seize this opportunity we in the cervical cancer community will be stepping up all our efforts to help developing countries get this disease under control
9395396 sure there are things going on but not as obvious people are taking a lower profile dealing with each other a little differently
9395397 when you dont see as many conflicts and clashes its a positive every time we can pull a guy out of that activity that is a win
9395398 every now and then they gang members can be a nuisance but nothing major
9395399 this is just one of the things that needs to be done to address the gang situation
9395400 most guys just know there is an injunction and they figure if they can go after them northcide four trey they can come after me
9395401 if he is not aware of the injunction and he is talking on his cellphone trying to talk to a family member he could be mistaken for a gang member
9395402 we believe he has not ceased his gang activities since going underground
9395403 without an injunction we feel like hell move back to the safety zone and continue this injunction doesnt harm him it behooves him to clean up his act it is a benefit for everybody
9395404 he bent over backwards to do everything right to the point that his teammates voted him team captain his senior year
9395405 when i started in this business a 500 foot to 1 000 foot drill of 10 inch pipe was a big deal
9395406 now a 5 000 or 6 000 foot job of 42 inch pipe is a big deal and its jumping out to 8 000 or 9 000 feet
9395407 everybodys more environmentally sensitive so you drill more than you used to
9395408 would not be possible without horizontal drilling we want to minimize the impact on citizens
9395409 if you have to stop to make a weld that takes three hours
9395410 a lot is driven by the permits we have to get
9395411 if you were using half inch pipe you might use three quarter inch pipe because its going to through the stresses of being pulled
9395412 you might have one thickness of coating for trenching and a substantially thicker and harder material
9395413 the biggest problem is knowing what you have to look out for
9395414 people tell you where everything is but they forget about an old water line
9395415 my mother got through katrina but it took so much out of her she took sick and died right after it
9395416 if what happened during katrina happens again im never coming back you just get tired of it man
9395417 looters caught will go directly to general population in the big house the louisiana state pen angola prison
9395418 were from louisiana and for katrina we were all in iraq
9395419 this time were here and we want to make sure it doesnt happen again we want everyone to know were here
9395420 if we take another hit like katrina i dont think there is any way we could rebuild again
9395421 it makes the process much faster which keeps them from waiting very long to get on a bus
9395422 right now were calling all of our scheduled arrivals for tuesday to see if theyre still coming
9395423 we dont know how many people have this pms2 variant
9395424 we would like to take these findings to human tumor samples if we could find out which individuals carry this variant it might change our decisions about treating them with cisplatin
9395425 oh shit there are too many black kids in my calculus class how am i going to keep up
9395426 listen wolf i admire these fine americans strength in their crises ill even stipulate that i would have been less stoical than they were but please stop insulting the intelligence of the american people wolf im running to be president of the united states of america not to be president of the march of dimes already lets move on to more substantive issues
9395427 when youre living in a home you get used to things
9395428 for example a buyer might say why should we have to press the garage door opener twice to open it
9395429 its better to work out the deficiencies and address the issues than turn off a buyer
9395430 some of these issues homeowners are unaware of and would likely address anyway
9395431 you can only do so many childrens birthday parties before you go insane its kind of a refresher
9395432 were not actually contacting dead relatives but its pretty creepy
9395433 its the veneer of everything else that makes it magic
9395434 they didnt send me a bill so i thought dont worry about it
9395435 i live from paycheck to paycheck how i would ever come up with 2 600 its had me stressed to say the very least
9395436 would not be in favor of anything that would create unfair barriers to consumers looking to exercise their options in the marketplace
9395437 im so desperate maybe the only way is to go to the emergency room and cut my chest open myself
9395438 one of the reasons we continue to meet is frankly we learn more and more and more
9395439 i was disappointed that there still doesnt seem to be urgency in the need to expand services to the level needed even in the number of hospital beds or the wait for clinic services
9395440 i dont know if they have the leadership over there to be honest
9395441 as a resident back then you didnt think about access
9395442 we always thought of jps as its a county system and they dont have funding to take care of everything the way it should be
9395443 sometimes had to know somebody to try and go in the back way
9395444 they have finally recognized that we are here for the patients and whats best for the patients
9395445 lots of this stuff obstacles to access has been going on while ive been on the board
9395446 its been eye opening for me as someone thats been around jps for a while
9395447 thats wonderful compared to this was a board decision and forget it were not going to talk about it
9395448 i cant get any response about anything why theyre saying its elective
9395449 the good news is shes getting the appropriate care that she needs now
9395450 i wasnt aware of any phone call that she made to us
9395451 i guess i personally have not known this until now that youre telling me
9395452 i just cannot take it when i think about this city going through that again
9395453 i saw the humvees and the national guard driving down my street this morning and they waved and shouted at me they remember me from back then you know
9395454 and that sorta made me feel better because now at least theres qualified people holding the bad people back
9395455 yep nobody around here the folks here at this time are leaving
9395456 weve been warned i know i heard it all on the news that nah nah blah blah blah whatever
9395457 i dont have a car i dont have a bike
9395458 i moved here from florida and i know what a hurricane is like im staying
9395459 i live with a roommate an older man who is refusing to leave
9395460 i cant in good conscience leave him behind but i want to leave i dont have the energy to go through this again after katrina
9395461 at this point after seeing the weather report im starting to change my mind
9395462 weve gotten a raw deal from hurricanes so i make the decision to stay with seriousness
9395463 ive got 30 000 worth of food for this weekend and the last weather report i saw said it wasnt going to be worse than a 3
9395464 i just cant leave and besides people like you reporters need a place to eat right
9395465 if i think it is going to be bad ill get me and my family out
9395466 i will nothing is worth the harm but for now i dont see the need

9395469 a combination of anticipated outages at other production reactors coupled with unanticipated shutdowns is simply devastating the impact on the patients who are in need of diagnostic tests using these radioisotopes is very serious the united states and other countries are not prepared to adequately deal with the current situation let alone anticipate other situations as they continue to arise following the shutdown of canadas chalk river facility late last year we simply cannot afford to sit and wait as the situation continues to worsen
9395470 this could be described as a perfect storm in isotope availability
9395471 this is a cumulative situation where we cannot maintain a patchwork approach to isotope production and supply it also highlights the vulnerability of having no domestic source of clinically used isotopes in the united states
9395472 our highest priority remains the supply of these critical medical isotopes to the nuclear medicine community
9395473 this is a serious problem requiring a quick response and in depth solution
9395474 now more than ever it is critical that the united states along with other countries take the lead on recommending alternatives to ensure consistent access to mission critical isotopes which are essential to hospitals and their ability to provide patient care
9395475 the honeybee is the perfect lever especially to reach the youth
9395476 in the end the charges against the duke athletes turned out not to be true but for nearly nine months duke lived with allegations that three student athletes might have raped a student at a nearby university duke focused on its own reputation but missed an opportunity to talk about the larger issue of rape
9395477 sexual violence is a serious matter and organizations that find themselves confronting such charges even charges they suspect may not be true need to speak clearly and strongly to the issue of rape itself

9395481 these data provide interventional cardiologists with valuable new information about the use of drug eluting stents in patients with diabetes whose coronary artery disease presents such therapeutic challenges
9395482 the significant reduction in restenosis associated with the cypher stent which translated to better outcomes for patients in terms of tlr and overall mace is impressive it also is encouraging to note the data in this study on the safety of the cypher stent in this difficult to treat patient population
9395483 this study adds to the growing body of clinical evidence about the cypher stent in diabetics with coronary artery disease
9395484 these data are consistent with other recently reported clinical trial data that clearly indicate that the cypher stent performs differently than the taxus stent in diabetics which has been a topic of discussion and debate within the medical community for some time
9395485 our goal is to extend survival and improve the quality of life for cancer patients
9395486 as recently reported data from a phase ii trial for end stage colorectal cancer patients showed davanat extended median survival to 7 months with significantly reduced levels of side effects additionally the data showed no apparent change from the baseline measurements in clinical blood test parameters including platelets and white blood cell counts reduced toxicity data indicates improved quality of life

9395488 imaging features in patients undergoing liver rfa plus heat deployed nanoparticles
9395489 the medical and scientific communities interest in our innovative treatment approach and the results that thermodox has shown in early phase trials is most encouraging and reinforces our commitment to bringing our promising technology to market as rapidly as possible accordingly we continue to make progress in our pivotal phase iii hcc program we have enrolled patients in four out of the seven countries for which we have clinical trial agreements and have announced our plans for clinical development in japan funded and led by yakult honsha yakult is a leading japanese healthcare company with a rapidly growing oncology focus through this partnership agreement our goal is to ensure thermodox s presence in the promising japanese hcc market which is currently the 2nd largest global market based on incidence

9395491 during the last two decades advances in techniques used to identify microorganisms have proven that a large number of unknown communities exist in nature and zodletone spring 30 miles west of anadarko has several unique features perfect for this study
9395492 the spring has high sulfide and sulfur concentrations high levels of gaseous hydrocarbons and an absence of oxygen that makes it ideal to study and hunt for many of these unique bacteria
9395493 because these bacteria come from an environment in which oxygen is rare some sophisticated isolation strategies will be used in the laboratory as we verify their environmental role and avoid the presence of oxygen which can kill them

9395620 when the market turns it can take as long as 24 to 36 months for prices to reach realistic levels and we are now well into this process we may start to see a moderation in the rate of monthly price falls however with ever growing uncertainty among households over the broader economic outlook the repricing of housing still has some way to run
9395621 incentivise the issuance of new mortgage backed securities and covered bonds to give investors the confidence to return to the market
9395622 we know there is no silver bullet that will slay this monster but we need a joined up comprehensive approach to bring back confidence and give the public clarity about what is available while we wait for the government to act many home owners are trapped in a market offering little or no mobility without any prospect of good cheer in the autumn
9395623 it felt daunting because the workplace had moved on as well as the technology
9395624 i was concerned about not fitting in i was concerned not exactly about being old but about not being a new young recruit
9395625 it wasnt an all out job hunt but when i saw something id apply with basically no results i just got rejections it did undermine my confidence because i wondered about my age and the gap in employment
9395626 i remember thinking im a professional i wouldnt really require that sort of assistance i know how to write a cv but then a couple more years went by i was feeling desperate and questioning my employability i went to some of their interview workshops which were incredibly helpful
9395627 the rest of the world doesnt fall away when you have children
9395628 but your priorities are with your family youre not exactly asleep but youre in the dream of family life i wanted to ask what happens when that shifts and the world returns to you
9395629 id been judgmental before i really got to know some of these women
9395630 they were mostly women who had worked in the corporate world and realised when they had children that the idea of going back to a world that they hadnt loved and which hadnt loved them made them feel more than reluctant id always felt that everybody would find their passion in life and it was kind of na ve to think that was true i was very moved by some of these womens lives and their conflicts
9395631 its incredibly common here but even more so in the us over there maternity leaves are short vacation time is non existent and childcare is poor the factors are different in the uk but there are thousands of women in the same boat we see a huge number of women who planned to go back after the second baby but then moved house or had elder care issues and suddenly they look up and five seven 10 years have passed
9395632 i never took a conscious decision to stay out that long each time ive gone back has been through personal contacts id always kept talking to people and when something came up that i wanted to do i did it
9395633 there are a lot of challenges your confidence ebbs when youre away you come back and things have changed for example this time when i came back i was working in an open plan office for the first time ever but there are advantages too when youre on a career ladder its difficult to step back and think about what you really want to do
9395634 once i had my children it was very difficult to think about leaving them to go back to work
9395635 if you have maternity leave you have something to go back to otherwise you just get used to family life i was incredibly focused on making sure that my children could get the best care possible now they are on their way to school and i see there is the possibility of relaunching a version of the career i had
9395636 its difficult to read peoples reactions two of the companies didnt focus on my career break at all but at the other place they were very interested in what i did during the time off its hard to explain without seeming like youve been so in charge of the household that you dont want to leave it
9395637 in many ways i do feel my skills have increased i have done fundraising been involved in my daughters school and i have helped friends start small businesses its just a matter of convincing an employer that i have not been completely out of touch with whats going on in the world which i think is a real misconception anyway there are loads of women who are intelligent and ambitious but not out there earning money
9395638 the upside is that you are recruiting people with multiple years of experience before their career break so you are getting that intellectual capital back we are looking at ways to connect with women who might have been out of the workplace for longer than a year or two if we cant find a way to stay connected to them we lose the opportunity to retain some key talent
9395639 we do see a lot of people off ramping to two or three days a week working flexibly or taking a less high profile role as their children get older then they start back on the career track
9395640 ill be honest its far easier for us to place a woman who has had a shorter career break the average is three years for the women at the 10 year end of the spectrum their experience is probably not as relevant but we should give these women help because its important for the economy plus we see a lot of women who have taken time out and never plan to go back and then guess what theyre widowed or divorced
9395641 one city woman i know took a career break after her second child and ran the pta at the largest independent school in london for three years
9395642 she has been managing diverse stakeholder groups and doing a lot of fundraising and she inherited money where she has a trustee responsibility and so had to get up to speed on charity laws she has this fantastic experience schools churches and voluntary organisations benefit hugely from this pool of women
9395643 the whole going back to work thing is a big deal
9395644 when i applied for the course i found myself saying well i did a maths degree 20 years ago and i can provide you with a reference from someone i worked with 18 years ago you start to wonder if you are bringing anything valuable to them but it seems a lot of people are in this situation some of the teachers i have been with so far are people who have come to it mid life as a second career so that helps
9395645 it became a massive soul searching exercise did i want to go back to what i did before but in a compromised way you realise that you will have to retrain be at a lower level and give up a lot of what youve had with the children i thought i didnt want that enough you think how much am i prepared to give up do i have to spend thousands of pounds on courses take five years to qualify and then find i have a new career where i will not be there for the children at all
9395646 it has definitely worked out for me it is so stimulating and i do want to go out and do something but i talk to other mothers and they dont necessarily agree having come this far and compromised a lot they feel they dont want to compromise anything at all i know other people who tried to go back and said to me its really difficult the sooner the better its mainly to do with the experience you had being worth virtually nothing because its too long ago but i know a lot of people who are retraining it has been a huge shock for me to realise that most of my friends have not let themselves get into this position they have kept something going that is rewarding they have not taken several steps down the ladder
9395647 this wasnt going to be a polemic or a handbook about how you should live your life
9395648 one day you just woke up and knew there was somewhere you needed to be
9395649 i wanted to mark this moment in time but i think it is changing i did a radio show recently and fathers were calling in and saying things like i have an equal partnership with my wife this hasnt happened for the men i know in their forties but i can see it happening with younger guys men are finding great pleasure in being home with their children

9395678 i was in here yesterday you wouldnt wait on me
9395679 big mistake big huge i have to go shopping now
9395680 i am savoring the love offerings that you give to me when you truly worship me from your hearts i delight in my childrens praises but i take rich pleasure when you give me your deeper love
9395681 i also love to visit here and to look upon the offerings that are brought to me for i want you to know that i always remember the love that is given to me and that i take pleasure in remembering them you already know that i store up your tears in my house you know that i store up your prayers in my house i also store up your sacrifices in my house everything that you give to me from your heart every tear and prayer that is lifted up to me is very precious to me i dont forget anything i answer every tear that is shed i answer every prayer that is lifted before me i receive every sacrifice that is given and i cherish most of all your genuine love
9395682 i not only remember your offerings as i walk amongst them looking at them but i like to savor them as well remember i told you that we would partake of one another as you learned to live with me and to walk with me this is also part of that partaking i savor and taste your love and it is more than just an aroma to me it is more than just a fragrance or an occasional taste it is me partaking of you as you give me a portion of yourself in offering when i savor that portion that you have given to me then i can also release back to you the reality of the depth of that love so that we both can share together in that offering and we also partake of each other as you allow me to minister to you it is time for love to now grow and to bring the true transformation that has awaited this hour
9395683 i want my people to know that the love that they offer to me is precious and that i do care for them i do see them i do hear their cries to know me i do see their offerings and i am looking at their love i want my people to know that i am holding them and that now i am going to be unwrapping them i will now begin to also unfold them and cause them to know the deepness of my love for them and to come to understand the strength of my love which will reveal to them who i truly am i want them to know that i am walking in the midst of my people savoring them i am also bringing forth a new understanding of my deeper love into their beings so that they can know me i have come to set them free but i have also come to draw them closer to me i have come to restore the love in my house but i have come also to fill my house with even more love so that the world will also see my love
9395684 the roughness of the offerings that you saw in the bowl was the current state of unperfected love that has still not matured within my body i do receive the love that is offered to me but i desire even more heart maturity and i desire all of your love i am now moving amongst you to perfect your love when the world truly sees that you as my body in the earth do truly love with my love then they will turn to look at me
9395685 it is time for my harvest as i have shown you and it is also time for my love to increase for i will reap what is mine and i will reap what is due me so as i bring forth my greater works amongst you it will force the bowels that have been shut to fully open and the deeper unrestrained love will begin to break forth what has been lying dormant within you will now awaken what has been lost within you will now be found what has been stolen from you will now be restored what has been forgotten by you will now be remembered what has been hidden from you will now be uncovered what was dry within your heart will now come to life for my love now does its deepest work and who yet will hinder
9395686 watch as my storms in the natural approach and as they greatly roar and in the winds you will hear the voice declare who i am for i have come to receive what is mine and i will receive all who are mine and i will bring them in closer to me to feast and to dine what i have purged i will also perfect much purging and much removing has already been seen but watch now as the storms increase but know that as you see it in the natural that you are also sees the rending coming forth from within oh look in deeper and look past the surface into the depths of what i am doing and see even deeply even to the root within you and also around you that now gives way to a new shoot for i am opening the bowels of the hearts of my people and what the enemy has even tried to kill i say will surely not be taken but will indeed live i am bringing a great change to the surface for all men to see what i shake in the earth only mirrors the depths within mine that are also giving birth
9395687 i desire that my love burn even more brightly i desire that my house be seen as i am i desire that men savor me as much as i savor them so i am revealing my love and i will enlarge the reservoir of love that flows forth from within until it flows unchecked and unrestrained and then i can bring the force of my love which will fully remove all fear that has kept my people from drawing near i desire that you bear much fruit and that you live abundantly in the earth i desire that you enjoy the reality of my presence in your midst i desire that you walk in my ways in even fuller ways and you will do so as you learn to love as i love
9395688 i brought you here to remind you and to remind my people that i want to be loved by them with all of their hearts

9395691 the hand wasnt too much of a problem today although i didnt want to risk working it too hard there is a bit of bone floating around in there and when my wrist gets into a certain position in some of the corners the nerves get trapped and i get a shooting pain up my arm i can deal with that though and we have an important job to do this weekend we found a good setting for the bike this morning but it didnt work as well in the higher temperatures this afternoon so we had to switch back to something else and it worked much better we worked so hard on the race setting that we only had time to use two qualifiers at the end instead of the usual three with the first one i used a new front which needed a couple of laps to get scrubbed in so i came in to change the rear and whilst it was good it wasnt as good as the first one so the lap time could have been better but all in all im delighted to be on pole again its going to be a long tough race tomorrow but im looking forward to it
9395692 this weather is amazing but i think maybe its better if youre at the beach than at the track were in the wrong place i definitely prefer this to rain though so after the recent races when we have never been sure about the weather this is great im happy about our work because we did a good job with the qualifying tires this afternoon and we were able to improve with each one which is important in the end we couldnt match caseys time but anyway second on the grid is good for the race our race set up is still not perfect and there are some corners where we need to be faster still so we have to work to try to improve that tonight we have a lot of data now from the two days and so we will use this to try to come up with something to try in warm up tomorrow i think we can definitely still improve our race setting a little bit more
9395693 straight from yesterday morning its clear that this track is a different situation for us were struggling much less and my michelin tires are much more competitive again here so thanks to them i can ride in a good flowing rhythm once more and my tires are giving me the confidence that i need in order to go fast it feels really good to be back on the front row again and i am very happy today it is clear that to stay with stoner and valentino is going to be very hard but the important thing is that we have been able to compete with them today and were in a good position to try again tomorrow im still not thinking about results but i will just do my best try to take a good rhythm and try to put on a good race for all the fans

9395695 although the evolines visor can be rotated back or up to get the evoline over my head and eyeglasses it isnt easy and the sharply tapered sides pull my glasses down so i have to end up taking my eyeglasses off anyway put on the helmet then fit the temples of the eyeglasses in and around my ears it isnt that easy to do for me and it may not be for others also so take note

9395742 i cannot for the life of me understand why no one is playing up the part about le citoyen being a french citizen
9395743 just to set the record straight stephane dion is a citizen of france because he applied to be one when he was an adult and wanted to study for his socialism marxism degree in paris
9395744 hee hee one day ill become prime minister of canada and be in a position to take my marching orders from the palais de lelys e
9395745 hee hee one day ill become prime minister of canada and be in a position to take my marching orders from the palais de lelys e
9395746 its a little nerve wracking making the plans in the uncertain climate that were in
9395747 i wouldnt put it past him but so be it canadians will judge him for what he does and what he says
9395748 but in a minority situation is it politically just that the only party with the right to call an election is the opposition party
9395749 fixed election dates stop leaders from trying to manipulate the calendar simply for partisan political advantage
9395750 i expect that probably to double monday and possibly again tuesday
9395751 this is kind of the lull time almost everyone who is going to get out has gone and there are no storm effects expected for 10 12 hours
9395752 we have crews in all of the areas that could be affected and a fall back plan in case the station is compromised
9395753 but lots of american corporations do not pay corporation tax
9395754 while looking at historical records kerry emmanuel the atmospheric physicist at the massachusetts institute of technology found that the total power released by storms had drastically increased more than doubling in the atlantic ocean in the past 30 years
9395755 i would caution those who are huge proponents of vouchers to remind them a lot of the purpose of private schooling and home schooling is for less government intervention
9395756 it is a material and emotional recognition of the mistakes that our country has done to yours during the colonial era
9395757 the accord will provide for 200 million a year over the next 25 years through investments in infrastructure projects in libya
9395758 it is my duty as a head of government to express to you in the name of the italian people our regret and apologies for the deep wounds that we have caused you
9395759 to be able to answer that question one needs to know exactly why compensation was paid and the circumstances in which compensation was paid one needs to know the fact of the case between the italians and the libyans and how the issue for the payment of compensation arose no two cases are necessarily similar so in the absence of the facts and circumstances that led to the payment of compensation it will be totally speculative to say if nigeria could ask for compensation or be paid compensation by britain
9395760 we are going to continue to fight until they are both free
9395761 theyve been in prison much too long and they should be released it makes me think about how much we are haunted by our own history
9395762 it is important for people to understand the way in which two men could basically be framed up and kept in prison for 36 years even though theyre innocent
9395763 as a part of our struggle against the fascist movement we hacked the forum of www bloodandhonour com
9395764 some people in the far right extremist scene are going to get very nervous including activists from the ndp
9395765 evidence that blood and honour concerts continue to take place in germany

9395767 shes not qualified she doesnt have the judgment to be next in line to the president of the united states
9395768 as long as we properly handle the gustavication of the convention it may be a positive
9395769 blackwater mercenaries were patrolling new orleans in full battle dress and with assault weapons in what some called an end run around posse comitatus
9395770 it looks like theyre ready to do it again if so lets hope
9395771 they got married and have five kids get in touch with your former classmates
9395772 its hard to imagine that the cronyism that has marked the bush administration is not at play in blackwaters success
9395773 plan to electronically log and track evacuees with a bar code system
9395774 i am a strict pacifist my dad was in vietnam and i do not support war but i do support security
9395775 a plan to electronically log and track evacuees with a bar code system
9395776 many residents said the early stage of the evacuation was more orderly than katrina although a plan to electronically log and track evacuees with a bar code system failed and was aborted to keep the buses moving
9395777 maybe theyre counting on the drop in viewership to diffuse the inevitable comparison between mccain and obamas acceptance speeches
9395778 hi im john mccain and if im president and youre really really really lucky your town can look like this after four years of me
9395779 you think you have it bad after this hurricane why when i was a pow
9395780 i will select the individual whom i feel is the
9395781 severe repercussions dire consequences for novemeber elections and all elections
9395782 energy is her strength i dont think anyone can touch her on that
9395783 it would not be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a challenge in the form of a natural disaster was taking place
9395784 you know sarah palin used to be a sportscaster and shes the vice presidential candidate so i think i wanna do that yeah
9395785 this is really going to put alaska on the map now people are going to find out what were really all about
9395786 a plan to electronically log and track evacuees with a bar code system
9395787 many residents said the early stage of the evacuation was more orderly than katrina although a plan to electronically log and track evacuees with a bar code system failed and was aborted to keep the buses moving
9395788 putins people captured all kinds of highly sensitive documents in georgia and the bush people are apparently terrified about what might turn up
9395789 you can choose that but you will lose make a realistic choice
9395790 i obviously dont want to torture any prisoners i want to let the underlings do it
9395791 obviously mccain and his republican pals will do and say anything to get elected whatever the focus groups and polls tell them thats the direction theyll head
9395792 abstinence minded pro life republican mom forced to conceal unwed teen pregnancy the big deal is w
9395793 oh no i can imagine riot cops using similar gear only spraying mace instead of water
9395794 if they can get you to give up flying then trains and buses are next then cars then talking to yo
9395795 that has to be the coolest piece of schwag ever made
9395796 letters presuppose a sort of authenticity and i truly believe that a story no matter the form needs to be authentic and believable
9395797 im not a terrorist so i dont care about the patriot act
9395798 the cause for the search warrant is not public at this time
9395799 a gas mask bolt cutters axes slingshots homemade caltrops for disabling buses even buckets of urine
9395800 a terrorism enterprise investigation may be initiated when facs or circumstances reasonably indicate that two or more persons are engaged in an enterprise for the purpose of furthering the political or social goals wholly or in part through activities that involve force or violence and a federal crime
9395801 ending a sentence with a preposition is a piece of utter impertinance up with which i will not put
9395802 those in the msm that fail to cover this kind of story are no longer
9395803 how you are treated in this country has depended on a number of things mainly the following 1 the color of your skin 2 the political party you owe your allegiance to 3 how much money power you have 4 who youre related connected to 5 what invisible man you worship those are the primary things that affect how you are treated in this country of course there are many other factors but when you get right down to it those five are the major ones its all about the consolidation of power there are people who have a vested interest in keeping large groups of people weak and ignorant its one of the main reasons why neocons attack people who are educated knowledge is a form of power notice that dubya bush whos just short of being mentally retarded hes definitely a sociopath was the poster boy of the gop for nearly a decade they considered anyone who was intelligent elitist yet its perfectly acceptable to them to have a corrupt backwoods alcoholic retard who nearly flunked out of college and who went awol run this country they want people like him to considered the american ideal it should scare people half to death to think that there are legions of morons wandering our streets and running this country the few members of the neocons who arent complete idiots are so morally twisted that they shouldnt be considered wholly human yet there they are trying to control your lives
9395804 adolph was going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a 22 250 rifle which had been sighted at 750 yards
9395805 johnson was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama and he responded in the affirmative
9395806 you know i dont know uh bunch of meth heads get together i dont know what they do i dont get inside their brain but we take them very seriously what they do i have to just emphasize this is a group of people there were a number of people that are using meth i dont know how many of you know meth anyone here not know about meth this is a really terrible drug people do all sorts of stupid things on meth
9395807 there is no credible threat right now and there was no credible threat based on the evidence that we have to senator obama or anybody else related to what we know about this case
9395808 you know i dont know what they were for and well keep looking into that
9395809 you know they didnt they didnt reveal a plan i think what you can see in the affidavit was uh a lot of racist rantings and a lot of dislike for the idea of senator obama as an african american person of color being able to pursue that office
9395810 like i said we all have an open mind about this we take this very seriously
9395811 you know as the affidavit shows there was a search done they searched the hotel room they searched vehicles and they obviously have looked for any kind of evidence that might indicate a threat or a plot or a conspiracy and at the this time we have insufficient evidence to believe that any of those things occurred
9395812 at these particular moments to go into the issue of a legal threat when you talk about threatening presidential candidates theres a legal standard you got to meet its got to be a credible threat as defined by the law its what the law calls a true threat and that means that someone has a way to carry it out and at this time we dont have sufficient evidence that there was a true threat
9395813 senator mccain if you are reading this then you are already dead unless of course you cant or dont breathe
9395814 a death threat is not a legitimate form of political expression
9395815 i guarantee you the secret service is taking this seriously and is so far up the ass of these guys the three men arrested you cannot even imagine
9395816 i have no further comment other than what was said at the press conference yesterday
9395817 i am concerned about a black president being assassinated and having the rodney king riots in los angeles following us everywhere
9395818 i am concerned about a black president being assassinated and having the rodney king riots in los angeles following us everywhere
9395819 watch out if prez obama is assassinated and subliminal messis that most probably he will be assassinated then all hell will break loose in the streets of america hence the clear
9395820 the law recognizes a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
9395821 the cause for the search warrant is not public at this time
9395822 just a space to get food free internet community organization
9395823 and what about these jack boots in mn and their illegal preemptive raids on suspected protesters where is the media outcry on this talk about your gestapo police tactics this one was pulled straight out of the ss playbook
9395824 im offended by barack obama saying that about my husband
9395825 they lied about our candidates war experience so well lie about theirs
9395826 offend me heck no this is what the politics of going after the highest elected position in the land is about like water off a ducks back george
9395827 yeah but he was an admirals son isnt that elite
9395828 they lied about our candidates war experience so well lie about theirs
9395829 they lied about our candidates war experience so well lie about theirs
9395830 would you be more or less likely to vote for john mccain if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child
9395831 they lied about our candidates war experience so well lie about theirs
9395832 they lied about our candidates war experience so well lie about theirs
9395833 would you be more or less likely to vote for john mccain if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child
9395834 they lied about our candidates war experience so well lie about theirs
9395835 what no palin is she ready to face the national press or not i see a few former vp hopefuls
9395836 what are the chances even one of them will ask her about her husbands reputed hot tempter
9395837 when faced with his first major decision as the republican presidential nominee john mccain chose to make a reckless gamble
9395838 mciiird said he would pick the best qualified individual he knwe for the position
9395839 i am so glad that i have found a soul mate and a partner
9395840 i am so glad that i have found a soul mate and a partner
9395841 the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
9395842 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
9395843 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
9395844 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
9395845 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
9395846 you can put lipstick on a pig but its still a pig
9395847 if it walks like a duck quacks like a duck maybe one of these will resonate with your level of comprehension eh
9395848 you can put lipstick on a pig but its still a pig
9395849 if it walks like a duck quacks like a duck maybe one of these will resonate with your level of comprehension eh
9395850 weve been together a long time but this is enough
9395851 less qualified as a senator than palin is as a governor
9395852 this choice proves mccain is a prisoner of the right wing not a maverick
9395853 now were going to hear another dozen pow references for the next week
9395854 i have three words for you diebold ess and sequoia
9395855 senator mccain picked sarah palin over you so apparently senator mccain thinks palin more qualified than you are to be commander in chief is that correct is gov palin more qualified to be commander in chief than you are
9395856 ive been talking to all of them but you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9395857 cnn mccains plans to make natural disaster backdrop for his convention
9395858 okay guys how use this storm to our advantage ideas
9395859 my friends violent winds blowing im here i say i say
9395860 my friends violent winds blowing im here i say i say
9395861 john mccain and sarah palin direct emergency operations following gustav
9395862 i lost the blame game last time but im more prepared for it now
9395863 really makes them seem human this year compared to katrina
9395864 evacuation plans do not include those who were foolish enough to stay behind
9395865 whats up im gustav and im just blowing be long
9395866 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now

9395868 save new orleans and make it a great city again

9395875 you know something im a mother i can do it
9395876 cindy mccain touts palins experience the pta and proximity to russia
9395877 palin has been on a bunch of super secret international diplomatic missions for bush over the last four years and since they were super secret we cannot talk about them
9395878 oh well its only 4 years well have a good laugh with w in office for only 4 years
9395879 our presidential candidate doesnt have much experience but your partys vp candidate doesnt either so there
9395880 our presidential candidate doesnt have much experience but your partys vp candidate doesnt either so there
9395881 our presidential candidate doesnt have much experience but your partys vp candidate doesnt either so there
9395882 and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here

9395897 a heartbeat away from succeeding a 72 year old four time cancer surviver
9395898 people across the nation struggle with the idea of building a bridge because theyve been under these misperceptions about the bridge and the purpose said palin who described the link as the ketchikan areas potential for expansion and growth palin said alaskas congressional delegation worked hard to obtain funding for the bridge and that she would not stand in the way of the progress toward that bridge 8 8 06 we need to come to the defense of southeast alaska when proposals are on the table like the bridge and not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something thats so negative palin said
9395899 a heartbeat away from succeeding a 72 year old four time cancer surviver
9395900 2 things that should not be spoken about are politics and religion
9395901 then would you support the death penalty for murder for these doctor and the would be mother there were abortions before roe v wade if banned where do you think they will go
9395902 this is like going fishing and not casting your line then you go back to the store and buy some fish sticks to bring home instead
9395903 the time is right to develop these resources because of the price of fuel
9395904 the economics of huge projects like these have got to look really good for a company to take on that kind of risk
9395905 we dont know yet if shes asking for too much
9395906 i can understand mccain not picking romney they couldnt stand each other
9395907 please tell me that there arent that many low information voters that buy that line
9395908 i follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell
9395909 but you wont follow them to the cave they reside
9395910 letters presuppose a sort of authenticity and i truly believe that a story no matter the form needs to be authentic and believable
9395911 self described as vintage rather than old or new labour
9395912 i would see the logical conclusion of this intolerance enforced secularist mindset forcing its own poisonous dangerous dated pathetic ignorant liberal leftist faux religion down every childs throat in the name of progress and under the entirely deluded pretence that this is the state acting as a neutral arbiter
9395913 nice middle class kids plus a few others who behave the same way
9395914 i suspect that an awful lot of people feel like this including a good number of parents whose children attend schools run by religious institutions and funded by the state
9395915 seriously do you really think most parents who send their kids to faith schools are bigots thats how you describe them in that paragraph
9395916 i dint mean to imply that it was poorly worded i meant middle class nothing to do with race etc
9395917 so nothing to do with the standard of teaching the learning culture the ethos
9395918 the kista kunskapsskolan in a suburb of stockholm has 332 students aged from 12 to 15 it is deliberately different from the state school model
9395919 it is hard to see any conflict between the company and our parents as our profit comes from good results and satisfying parents and students if we dont perform well then we dont make any profit at all
9395920 because schools which do not attract parents lose out and they should be losers
9395921 no uniform very informal discipline and teaching an open plan layout and an emphasis on individualised learning rather than formal classes the students negotiate their own timetable each week and can do as few or as many formal classes as they wish
9395922 the students negotiate their own timetable each week and can do as few or as many formal classes as they wish
9395923 tomorrows program will be business only and will refrain from any political rhetoric that would be traditional in an opening session of a convention
9395924 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9395925 on saturday a democrat tasked with opposition research contacted the huffington post with this piece of information as of this weekend the mccain campaign had not gone through old newspaper articles from the valley frontiersman palins hometown newspaper
9395926 its unbelievable we were the only people to do that which means the mccain camp didnt
9395927 his advance team didnt come to alaska to check her out
9395928 he clearly knows that this is on the borderline of what is acceptable for him to be doing
9395929 my jot as vice president is as an adviser i dont run anything
9395930 theres no need to pick up the phone and talk to the russians right now
9395931 russia does not want confrontation with any country russia does not plan to isolate itself
9395932 everyone should understand that if someone launches an aggressive sortie he will receive a response
9395933 i think it said binladen determined to strike in the u s

9395936 letters presuppose a sort of authenticity and i truly believe that a story no matter the form needs to be authentic and believable
9395937 you cant put this genie back in its bottle there never was a bottle
9395938 theres going to be a diffusion of viewpoints people are going to find it easier than ever to find one viewpoint they like and will stick with that
9395939 rigging or slanting the news is a most heinous act against the public interest
9395940 before you leftists respond with fox be aware that independent studies and democrats including the clintons say fox is the most fair and balanced
9395941 i really am troubled by this pattern of behavior and comments that you hear on msnbc
9395942 i thought that foxs coverage during the primary was comprehensive and fair and evenhanded
9395943 its a huge audience and it is important to have a strong progressive voice on the network
9395944 i want five weeks vacation to get a facelift before the convention
9395945 lets just elect mccain palin im too old to fight in a civil war
9395946 ce qui est embarrassant cest que le pr sident de la r publique annonce de mauvaises mesures qui sont mal financ es
9395947 ce nest pas une bonne action aujourdhui qui va effacer le p ch originel du bouclier fiscal
9395948 ce sont les moyens revenus qui seront assujettis cette forme dimp t de solidarit il reste de tr s fortes injustices m me apr s une d cision qui pourrait para tre bonne

9395952 ceux qui ont cri la r cession jouent les oiseaux de mauvais augure artificiellement
9395953 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans not as republicans
9395954 the hurricane is going to hit new orleans about the time they start
9395955 the timing is at least it appears now it will be there monday that just demonstrates god is on our side
9395956 you see gentlemen theres this thing called being humane and caring
9395957 well that must show that god is on our side
9395958 if you vote for me ill make all your wildest dreams come true
9395959 governor you cant say this but i will lyda green is a cancer and a b
9395960 i also find it amusing that you are able to glean the insight of the thought patterns of everyone youre commenting on knowing what evangelicals think as well as the thinking of the two democrats on the plane and surprisingly evangelicals have mal intent while the democrats were well intended amazing
9395961 well then you should be able to provide us all with the long history of quotes
9395962 people made bad decisions but over half those that died during katrina were over 75
9395963 oe flaquita no te exasperes que habl sobre eso el viernes o mira el s bado
9395964 we heard some gun shots from some group of people that i am told by residents here that they are people that are known in town who belong to the opposite divide
9395965 we have to take great pains in calming our people in order not to retaliate to such unnecessary provocation and unnecessary intimidation by our opponent
9395966 i want to sound a note of warning that this intimidation and harassment would cease if and only if they stop doing what they are doing
9395967 great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities the latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence
9395968 unable to find a file for volume extraction please verify you have proper permissions
9395969 weve all started new jobs from time to time in our career
9395970 nobodys qualified on the first day i dont care whether its barack obama whether its john mccain youre not going to be qualified the first day you walk into the white house but like all of us we grow into our new roles and i have no doubts that john mccain is going to grow into his new role as president of the united states very well i have no doubts that sarah palin can grow into her role as vice president
9395971 i take the occasion to say bye to all the fans who have always been close to me in the nice and bad moments
9395972 i really dont have anywhere to go if i could leave i could go home but that doesnt seem like the thing to try too far i guess

9395975 the minor iphone security issue which surfaced this week is fixed in a software update which will be released in september

9396073 what were finding is there are very very few zebra mussels
9396074 quagga mussels clear up the water and foul the bottom
9396075 anytime youre taking food out of the water column which is what both the quagga and zebra mussel do youre then taking food from something else
9396076 were starting to establish some new food chains and food webs within the great lakes ecosystem
9396077 if we ignored the presence of these mussels on the intake screens our operations would be affected adversely
9396078 the scan council would not exist in ottawa county without the childrens trust fund money

9396089 we really proposed a fish cleaning station that would be best for the park
9396090 we can do it for less than that that would be the maximum cost
9396091 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9396092 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9396093 we also have to be concerned about future generations of americans
9396094 were going to end up with the highest deficit probably in the history of this country
9396095 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber
9396096 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so
9396097 overpopulation will become the single greatest issue facing america and the world in the 21st century
9396098 theres a burning concern in the american west almost an obsession that democrats do not dare touch in their convention here nor will republicans in st paul it is the u s population explosion the west is feeling the brunt of it as rolling lava of housing developments and big box cruds capes claim its cherished open spaces and increasingly scarce water supplies
9396099 americas fastest growing region has been and will continue to be the intermountain west its megalopolises centered on denver phoenix las vegas and salt lake city are set to add 13 million people by 2040 according to a brookings institution study this would be a doubling of their population
9396100 such projections point to a huge opportunity for the front range to improve on the current level of prosperity
9396101 and where oh where are they going to find water
9396102 every county in colorado was declared a federal drought disaster area in 2002 when the population stood at 4 5 million it is expected to approach 8 million by 2035
9396103 this is an area that plans to add 13 million people
9396104 why isnt the population boom being discussed at the party conventions
9396105 because its main driver is immigration both the number of newcomers and their high birth rates the region is also trying to accommodate people relocating from other parts of the country many of them trying to escape the congestion in california
9396106 promoters of open borders like to drag race into any discussion of immigration so that even those who focus on numbers not skin color fear to speak the sierra club has gone into total hiding on the matter even when you limit the subject to illegal immigration theyre under the bed
9396107 in 2004 lamm and two other environmentalists wanting to address population pressures ran for the sierra clubs board
9396108 the full story can be found at a web site www susps org susps used to call itself sierrans for u s population stabilization fred elbel a former director and denver resident describes himself as liberal democrat who left the party in frustration over its failure to confront the demographic realities of immigration
9396109 but immigration and urban population growth will be the defining issue for our country in this century
9396110 the parties do talk about immigration he adds but never its environmental implications
9396111 for sure the two national parties will be jabbering on about the nations groaning infrastructure global warming and in deference to the west and south the water crisis but you can bet that they wont go near the thing that makes all these problems worse americas exploding population
9396112 he laid waste to the church and entering house after house he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison
9396113 your blood be upon your heads i am innocent from now on i will go to the gentiles

9396145 we dont believe that you can tell the difference between a world leader and a beauty queen
9396146 we really dont have the luxury of sort of trying to evaluate the politics of this kind of situation
9396147 i think we take it as it is and right now we have a horrible storm bearing down on the gulf people should be more concerned about that than a political campaign and i think thats the way were going to let the chips fall
9396148 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9396149 we are working with the delegations financial people finance committees many other concerned individuals to do what we can to raise money for various charities that operate in the gulf coast region

9396276 the xm team had a great strategy today they know the rule on changing the driver and i jumped in right at about 45 minutes into the race james did a good job with car and i was able to race pretty well with the leaders i had to get into position to pit for fuel only when the other leaders changed drivers tires and fuel it was tough to try and stay on the groove it was easy to get pickup rubber on my tires so i was able to use traffic to make a strong run at the end we have been close to a win previously and we fi nally got it today i feel good for the xm acura team
9396277 i got a good start and moved into third early then on the restart i made a bold move inside of simon pagenaud but the car slid wide with the marbles it took me four or five laps to get the rubber off the tires and i lost about five seconds after that the xm car was very good franck did a tremendous job taking the car home for the win the last two races were tough for all of our xm crew we thought we had the win at road america and we were close at mosport so this win is a great feeling for everyone at andretti green racing
9396278 when i jumped in the car we lost a couple of spots due to different strategies today but the car was very good i was able to move from fifth to second and get close to franck but it was very tough to move around some of the traffic without getting the marbles on your tires so i made a couple of strong attempts to push the car at the end but it wasnt there it was more important to calm down and get the points today we are in a championship fight and points are a key a great 1 2 3 finish for acura today just fantastic
9396279 the patr n highcroft team gave me a great car today we were fast from the start then traffic hurt me a little bit simon was able to get by due to my tires being worn out we ran a lot of laps with the michelins they were very strong we ran more laps than nor mal before we stopped i was trying to be clean and give david a strong car this was an important event for points for the title run and we moved within four points of the lead plus acura took the lmp2 manufacturers lead today it is great for all of the acura teams
9396280 the de ferran team gave me a great car today earlier in the race i was sliding around a bit and i needed to get the tires warm but after that our panasonic els acura was very fast i think we showed that this young team is getting better each race
9396281 it is great day for acura to finish 1 2 3 in the class and 1 2 overall we had a great car today simon was outstanding the race came down to strategy we were leading the race and really couldnt pit under the green flag conditions some of the other teams played it differently and it paid off for them we tried that type of strategy last week and we missed it by a second from a victory overall im pleased with the perform ance of the team and the car we are looking forward to the petit le mans in another month
9396282 we dont know what happened we think something broke on the car we are not 100 percent certain but it is very disappointing
9396283 one of the reasons i need to stay active on this board is on these boards i am in the majority with my food choices and surrounded by people who support a low carb diet it gives me the confidence to go out into the real world and not give in to pressure from the rest of the world to eat like they do

9396316 it is time for the prime minister to review his role and behaviour
9396317 you should ask yourself whether you should maintain the premiership
9396318 your solutions do not show that you want to keep democracy why are the only solutions house dissolution and resignation why cant we choose the third option which is to show the world that we maintain our democracy

9396331 talk to any busy breast cancer surgeon and theyll tell you 30 percent of the diagnoses are made by the patient not that they have cancer but they found their own lumps
9396332 just this morning i saw a 37 year old woman with a normal mammogram but she found a lump and was proactive about it and it turned out to be cancer
9396333 the world of early detection of breast cancer is imperfect
9396334 but this report robs women of one of the key tools in what is already a limited arsenal for detection it sends the wrong message to women about their role in their own health care
9396335 the midwifery model of care is based on empowering women to be the experts on their own bodies and health
9396336 i encourage women to check their own breasts once in a while so they can know whats normal for them and then they would be able to tell if something changes

9396351 so we combined traveling and biking as a way to save on the cost of gas
9396352 we just queried our e newsletter list over 30 000 people and got a landslide of stories

9396360 the residents loved that it was a karaoke kind of thing and they all enjoyed getting up there and singing
9396361 we were quite content we were happy one big happy family
9396362 but it depressed me to see the difference ill just remember it the way it was
9396363 how would you feel if someone came in and said you were losing your home
9396364 didnt really know why its going to hurt anybody in the community
9396365 walking up the stairs i felt like i could feel that building tell me to save this building and save this history
9396366 a world in which children with developmental disabilities would no longer be shunned by society
9396367 it was about giving people a home people that needed that extra help but the budget came first
9396368 i heard that the commissioners just wished the whole place would disappear well its not going to disappear in the hearts and minds of the people of this community
9396369 you know the experience that she comes from is what she has done in government and remember that alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia
9396370 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9396371 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9396372 we also have to be concerned about future generations of americans
9396373 were going to end up with the highest deficit probably in the history of this country

9396377 well god put us in charge of the animals and their numbers need to be thinned out for the new oil pipeline going through alaska and why not teach creationism in schools both sides need to be represented and abortion is murder
9396378 this reinforces the idea that treating patients with heart failure takes more than just drugs
9396379 with a lot of these patients you have no other choice
9396380 theyve tried other treatments and are at the end of the road
9396381 its a small benefit but we should always be emphasizing to patients what they can do in terms of diet that might help
9396382 this study changes the certainty of the evidence we have about fish oils
9396383 this is a low tech solution and could help all patients with cardiovascular problems
9396384 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9396385 theres very little doubt that we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action action to help our fellow citizens in this time of tragedy and disaster action in the form of volunteering donations reaching out our hands and our hearts and our wallets to the people who are under such great threat from this great natural disaster
9396386 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9396387 take off their republican hats and put on their american hats

9396394 i will continue to use my pencil as long as i can

9396704 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9396705 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9396706 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9396707 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9396708 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9396711 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9396712 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9396713 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti

9396725 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9396726 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9396727 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9396728 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9396729 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale

9396747 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9396748 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9396749 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono

9396758 in queste ultime settimane ha detto ratzinger al termine della recita dell angelus dal palazzo apostolico di castel gandolfo la cronaca ha registrato laumento degli episodi di immigrazione irregolare dallafrica
9396759 non di rado la traversata del mediterraneo verso il continente europeo visto come un approdo di speranza per sfuggire a situazioni avverse e spesso insostenibili si trasforma in tragedia quella avvenuta qualche giorno ha aggiunto il papa ricordando i recenti casi di sbarco di clandestini che hanno prodotto numerosi morti fa sembra aver superato le precedenti per lalto numero di vittime la migrazione fenomeno presente fin dagli albori della storia dellumanit che da sempre pertanto ha caratterizzato le relazioni tra popoli e nazioni
9396760 lemergenza in cui si trasformata nei nostri tempi tuttavia ci interpella e mentre sollecita la nostra solidariet impone nello stesso tempo efficaci risposte politiche so che molte istanze regionali nazionali e internazionali si stanno occupando della questione della migrazione irregolare ad esse va il mio plauso e il mio incoraggiamento affinch continuino la loro meritevole azione con senso di responsabilit e spirito umanitario
9396761 senso di responsabilit devono mostrare anche i paesi di origine non solo perch si tratta di loro concittadini ha aggiunto benedetto xvi ma anche per rimuovere le cause di migrazione irregolare come pure per stroncare alle radici tutte le forme di criminalit ad essa collegate dal canto loro i paesi europei e comunque quelli meta di immigrazione sono tra laltro chiamati a sviluppare di comune accordo iniziative e strutture sempre pi adeguate alle necessit dei migranti irregolari questi ultimi poi vanno pure sensibilizzati sul valore della propria vita che rappresenta un bene unico sempre prezioso da tutelare di fronte ai gravissimi rischi a cui si espongono nella ricerca di un miglioramento delle loro condizioni e sul dovere della legalit che si impone a tutti
9396762 come padre comune sento il profondo dovere di richiamare lattenzione di tutti sul problema e di chiedere la generosa collaborazione di singoli e di istituzioni per affrontarlo e trovare vie di soluzione il signore ha concluso benedetto xvi ci accompagni e renda fecondi i nostri sforzi

9396770 apprezzabili le sue lusinghe ma sconcertante le sue denigrazioni della classe dirigente delludc toscano
9396771 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9396772 tutta lestate lon enrico letta ha sostenuto pi volte limportanza di un dialogo aperto con ludc per una possibile alleanza in futuro sostenendo che tale opportunit sia lunica che permetta al suo partito di poter tornare a governare il paese
9396773 legittime aspirazioni ed analisi politica ineccepibile dal suo punto di vista tenendo anche conto della sua provenienza e della sua storia personale che chiaramente lo rende molto pi propenso a guardare al centro piuttosto che verso la sinistra radicale la quale per gli ha permesso per ben due volte di essere un autorevole esponente del governo prosegue comunque le sue lusinghe possono essere apprezzabili anche se relativamente interessanti abbastanza sconcertante invece quando lo si sente denigrare la classe dirigente delludc toscano alla festa del suo partito a modena
9396774 le sue affermazioni sono chiare e precise ha addirittura utilizzato un aggettivo che ci risparmiamo di ripetere che non lascia spazio a fraintendimenti
9396775 cotanto giudizio conclude certamente non toglier il sonno a noi militanti delludc toscano le nostre scelte le abbiamo gi fatte

9396780 any kind of involvement with hollywood is a waste of my time and there is no amount of money that can compensate for that i think the industry is an embarrassment on all sorts of levels but sure there are bad comics bad books and bad culture so its not just films that produce an overwhelming majority of unwatchable rubbish but films that are unwatchable rubbish cost 100 million that is the budget of an emerging third world nation which is the point where it goes from being merely tasteless to being kind of evil
9396781 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
9396782 you know i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
9396783 and someone who has extensively researched church teachings on this issue she has found church fathers were unsure when life begins she further claimed that the catholic church has only during the last 50 years begun to insist that life begins at conception
9396784 v arious scholars theorized about when and how the unborn child might be animated or ensouled but none diminished the unique evil of abortions as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
9396785 for you formed my inward parts you covered me in my mothers womb i will praise you for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are your works and that my soul knows very well
9396786 as you do not know what is the way of the wind or how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child so you do not know the works of god who makes everything
9396787 assuredly i say to you inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren you did it to me

9396852 but it was bumper to bumper for about 10 hours trying to get out
9396853 i thought it was going to be a piece of cake as soon as we hit the interstate it was bumper to bumper it was very very slow moving
9396854 we were just two months away to open up and the whole thing came down
9396855 after katrina it took us almost a year and three months to get ready to open again it was very hard to get back to where we were because the money was gone for some people it was even worse because they had taken out loans
9396856 im worried because its my livelihood my wife runs the restaurant with my sister in law we worked so hard to get there if it gets destroyed again ill probably go bankrupt im just praying that its going to be ok

9396862 100 percent accurate the levees will barely hold or barely be overtopped
9396863 i want to emphasize if the storm shifts slightly east you could have very significant flooding in these areas
9396864 thatll put the total a little over 1 9 million people
9396865 when critically ill patients are evacuated it certainly can be very risky
9396866 the important thing though is for people to take these warnings take this opportunity very seriously now is the time to get out of harms way
9396867 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans we have to join the 300 million other americans on behalf of our fellow citizens its a time for action so were going to suspend most of our activities tomorrow except for those absolutely necessary
9396868 we will adopt our rules that allow us to go forward and allow us to go forward in the future we will elect our officers of the convention and we will adopt our party platform
9396869 those are essentials for us to be able to constitute before we can nominate the president and vice president thats the action that will occur tomorrow
9396870 well refrain from any political rhetoric that would be traditional in an opening session of a convention
9396871 we hope and pray conditions in the gulf dont deteriorate

9396875 the extreme productivity seminar really helped me improve my existing gtd setup much recommended to get more done in less time
9396876 having a good tracking system for opportunities portfolio companies and managing time in general is critical for running a venture firm well i looked at and experimented with just about everything ismaels approach to extreme productivity is the only system ive seen that combines the ease of use and power that i was looking for highly recommended and very thought provoking
9396877 ismael is an inspiration the fact that he is able to accomplish an enormous number of activities without stress is a testament to his discipline and organization if you are already familiar with the principles of gtd and want to learn how you can take your practice of it to the next level i urge you to take a serious look at his extreme productivity seminar

9396882 we got the call from corporate this morning to take him down
9396883 someone whos stopped government from wasting taxpayers money on things they dont want or need and put it back to work for the people
9396884 i championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9396885 in 2006 the american people voted house republicans out of power for one simple reason we lost our way
9396886 and over the last 20 months house republicans have worked each and every day to renew our commitment to the principles that led the american people to trust us with the congressional majority in 1994
9396887 with their background in fighting wasteful spending sen mccain and gov palin are perfectly suited to lead the charge against higher taxes and more pork
9396888 and house republicans are prepared to join them we have pledged that if we are elected to the majority this november we will enact an immediate ban on congressional earmarks establish a bipartisan panel to fundamentally reform how congress spends taxpayer dollars and adopt real spending limits that keep wasteful washington spending in check all while blocking the democrats plan for the largest tax increase in american history
9396889 they vote on it when it becomes apparent like the bridge to nowhere was that their moneys being wasted
9396890 these fellas know how to tackle its just about trust
9396891 this could be potentially the most dangerous storm for the energy sector weve ever seen said chris jarvis senior analyst at caprock risk management in hampton falls new hampshire
9396892 it does not make sense to put you your family or first responders at risk by just sitting there when theres plenty of opportunity to get out
9396893 anybody whos caught looting in the city of new orleans will go directly to angola louisiana state penitentiary you will not have a temporary stay in the city you go directly to the big house in general population
9396894 owing to the fact that mccain has asked us to take our republican hats off and put our american hats on tomorrows program will be business only and well refrain from any political rhetoric that would be traditional in an opening session of a convention
9396895 were just not seeing those kind of numbers in terms of people needing city assisted services
9396896 i have older parents and living in south louisiana they think that they can handle any storm that hits

9396905 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans not as republicans
9396906 i think sen obama if they want to go down that route in all candor she has far far more experience than sen obama does

9396908 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9396909 the information weve gotten back from the lab that she was in the trunk of that car and that she is dead is certainly something we take seriously
9396910 the information wes gotten back from the fbi lab has clearly helped up focus out investigation

9396937 one thing i said at the gathering was leroy was somebody who truly never wore a mask
9396938 leroy had a knack for finding the means to connect
9396939 we can go through a whole career in journalism and most of us might get the occasional letter or e mail these days
9396940 leroy had a whole community with his daily blog entries and weekly radio commentary what he told me was this was the most satisfying work of his career
9396941 i cant tell you the number of people who have left comments saying the blog was the first thing they read every day that it got them through the day
9396942 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
