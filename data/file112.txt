1120242 legal officers are seeing new clients every day and dealing with issues ranging from serious crimes such as rape or trafficking to assistance in accessing services such as food assistance or medical care
1120243 we have seen an impressive rise in serious crimes handled in the formal justice system thanks to our cooperation with the thai police and justice officials
1120244 this year a total of 51 cases have been brought to the thai justice system including assistance to offenders who have been arrested outside camp working with unhcr and the thai authorities in many such cases we can successfully intervene to prevent deportation provide basic advice and ensure interpretation at hearings
1120245 we have also helped rescue four refugee girls who had been illegally trafficked for work as well as linking in with existing anti trafficking networks in thailand to ensure that they better understand the issue as it relates to refugees in camps
1120246 we often face challenges like lack of evidence to support investigations intimidation of victims or witnesses and cases where officials do not fully understand correct legal procedures having said that we enjoy strong support by the thai government and we have a good working relationship with ministry of interior and justice officials

1120257 coach smith is well known in the region not only for his coaching ability but by his commitment to the christian faith
1120258 he invests in the athletes he coaches and serves a mentor for them he is certainly a fine match for blue mountain college

1120351 since the introduction and initial deliveries of our proprietary lrad x systems in late march we have experienced growing domestic and international acceptance and increasing market demand that is continuing in fiscal q4
1120352 with the fulfillment of a previously announced 1 1 million lrad rx order and the expected deliveries of the recently announced marine expeditionary security force lrad 500x order and other pending orders were forecasting a strong q4
1120353 our significant investment earlier this year enhancing and upgrading our lrad technology and products is quickly being repaid through growing order demand for our proprietary lrad 1000x lrad 500x and lrad rx systems from diverse military and commercial security interests

1120357 this first producing acquisition is a great step forward for the company we are extremely enthusiastic about kicking off our growth strategy with the eddy county properties located in the prolific permian basin which is a major target for us in seeking future acquisitions
1120358 with financing from a strong partner like macquarie we believe we can make the most of the reserves in our current purchase and also have room to grow through future acquisitions
1120359 we believe the improvement plan could increase production from the existing wells by up to 30 an increase in near term production will strengthen the companys revenue base during the initial stages of implementing our program of new drilling
1120360 one of the most attractive aspects of this acquisition is that the shallow rights provide us the opportunity to drill and complete wells with lower costs and fewer operational risks than deeper wells the result is a risk reward profile that we believe can create great value for our shareholders as we extract the maximum upside from our purchase of the eddy county properties

1120393 there was a moment when the public opinion of the greatest empire in the world involved in the largest war in their history was changed by a few poets
1120394 and solzhenitsyn changed the story of the story of the soviet union he changed it from this difficult march to utopia to the decline of a brutal totalitarian state and his version of the soviet union lived longer than the official account that is a kind of social and cultural power that is special to writers
1120395 applauded congress for requiring all companies that import or sell all terrain vehicles in the united states to comply with the same vehicle safety standards and to implement the same training and other safety initiatives that established atv manufacturers have followed for years
1120396 these standards and programs are vital to ensure the safety of american atv riders we thank senators klobuchar pryor and stevens and the other house and senate conferees for their support in ensuring that this important atv safety provision was included in the final consumer product safety bill
1120397 appropriate configuration and performance aspects of atvs speed restrictions on youth atvs free hands on training programs and promotion of helmets and other proper gear
1120398 many non traditional atvs do not adhere to even minimal safety requirements nor do the companies provide training or safety information
1120399 the poor quality of many of these atvs create a danger for all atv riders particularly young riders who are being targeted by these companies
1120400 the atv provision codifies the current voluntary standards and action plans in effect the bill creates immediate mandatory standards for all atvs sold in the united states both imported and domestic

1120403 senator mccain some have said that obama is presumptuous and out of touch with the common man do you believe this
1120404 senator obama how do you respond to accusations that you are a worldwide celebrity but yet lack substance
1120405 senator mccain do you feel your opponent is as patriotic as you are
1120406 with doom we havent made final decisions yet but i would expect it to wind up being a larger focus than it was with quake 4 its still not going to be the central focus its still going to be a single player experience through that thats going to be a finely honed and crafted experience for people to get pulled through but multiplayer will be there as a significant asset
1120407 it is true that rage and the next doom are designed much more as a game that has a story arc that people can go through that we make sure that youre going to have fun through the whole thing its going to be balanced so that we never want to frustrate the player you never want to make them do something where theyre upset

1120415 for the last year hispanics have been losing jobs at a faster rate than any other group
1120416 i am willing to do whatever kind of job they offer me
1120417 i did not think this would be this hard before it was easier to find a job
1120418 we know that 2006 was the peak in hispanic homeownership with 49 percent since then more and more hispanics are losing their homes
1120419 the main point is to win your home games and our record shows that we like to win at home but it doesnt matter youve still got to go there and win at least one so tomorrow its not a must win but were definitely going to give it our all
1120420 teams hate it i think i finished 17 of 19 stolen bases so everybody know i go it give our hitters a chance to hit fastballs anything off speed im probably going to go so just by me getting on i help others behind me by getting good pitches to drive so for other teams its got to be frustrating

1120425 when i was coming up more top fighters fought each other they all wanted to prove they were the best in their weight class not in the wba the ibf but the best period but now the promoters and the networks get in the way and were losing a lot of fans because of it the promoters milk the prospects they dont match them against top fighters the networks allow too many easy fights
1120426 i would definitely say boxing is declining as the best are not fighting the best in the nba they dont just cancel the playoffs and have the lakers against some sorry team no one would watch thats why the ufc is gaining so much in popularity the best fight the best and the fans love to see it
1120427 the networks and the promoters but mainly the networks a promoter can say no to an opponent but the networks could come back and say well if he doesnt fight this guy then hes not on the network the networks arent standing up they give one promoter the easy ride but not the other
1120428 i would destroy the executives at all the tv networks they have their own agenda and if they continue to run boxing the way they run it itll continue to decline we need some young execs who want to make a name for boxing not themselves
1120429 hbo gives a lot of dates to certain managers and you wonder why the fighters in the last few months are all managed by one guy whos good friends with one of the big guys at hbo
1120430 administrator johnson tried very hard to convince us that the california waiver was denied as the result of a process that involved him making a decision that was to use his words repeatedly mine and mine alone
1120431 the response was that the president had a policy preference for a single standard that would be inconsistent with granting the waiver

1120500 the womens vote is important to both their campaigns women will decide this election
1120501 all of the primaries and caucuses so far have seen high numbers of unmarried women coming to the polls african americans vote more than any other group of unmarried women and will be a vital bloc of voters in the upcoming race in south carolina florida and other states on feb 5
1120502 unmarried african american women are asserting their political power like never before
1120503 african american unmarried women struggle to make ends meet and they will listen to candidates who have something to say about their lives and their hopes for the future
1120504 our research shows us and the first races have confirmed unmarried women are extremely motivated to participate in the 2008 elections and make their voices heard in the 2008 races
1120505 african american unmarried women will support the candidate who addresses their economic concerns and will help them provide a strong community for their families

1120508 i have to say that i absolutely will not support such a knee jerk reaction putting numerous small businesses out of business is not the answer worse now is these businesses wont put any details on and we put the public at risk

1120510 these integrated architecture system improvements are a direct response to manufacturers who seek a new generation of more powerful automation and production systems to automate and standardize their work processes more effectively
1120511 manufacturing organizations are becoming increasingly dependent upon the availability of real time information from all aspects of their production operations thus it is incumbent upon manufacturers today to deploy information architectures in the production environment that facilitates transparent connectivity between production equipment and all aspects of their enterprise
1120512 thousands of interested people have gathered in the centre of the capital of the south ossetian republic tskhinvali
1120513 the separatists and their patrons in moscow are trying to create an illusion of war a completely artificial illusion of a serious escalation
1120514 a certain number of children from tskhinvali have been sent to summer camps in north ossetia but i want to stress that there is no serious evacuation of civilians from the conflict zone
1120515 we call for an immediate halt to violence and call for direct talks between the parties
1120516 these incidents underscore the need for an immediate increase in the number of osce monitors in south ossetia

1120525 slowing demand and the hope for more supply is weighing on the market even as the geopolitics and the weather is getting wild

1120527 given the forecast for tropical storm edouard shell will begin limited evacuations of approximately 40 personnel from some of its gulf of mexico west operations area today

1120546 it was always the intention that it should be an international event
1120547 the whole point about the north atlantic fiddle conventions ideology its philosophy is that all of these traditions can stand side by side shoulder to shoulder and they all are as worthy if you understand of our interest and research
1120548 when you think of newfoundland culture when you think of how we are presenting ourselves the fiddle is there its always been there
1120549 it puts our fiddle tradition on a world stage in a way that you possibly wouldnt have been able to in any other normal circumstances

1120560 it is a great way to fill a few minutes in a speech that wont really have the impact on the american people that we need to again it is one of those very populist things that instead of being a service as it was intended on sites like mine it becomes part of his energy policy and that is a sham on the american public it is not an energy policy

1120596 beaked whale species appear to cease vocalising and foraging for food in the area around active sonar transmissions
1120597 since these animals feed at depth this could have the effect of preventing a beaked whale from feeding over the course of the trial and could lead to second or third order effects on the animal and population as a whole
1120598 active sonar releases energy into the ocean and there is evidence to suggest that this may have an effect on marine mammals however the precise scientific effects are not clear thus the mod has adopted a precautionary approach to mitigate effects on the marine environment environmental impact assessments are mandatory prior to the use of military sonar and the ability to predict and detect marine life continues to be developed in order to minimise any perceived threats to marine life
1120599 we know that sonar is linked to strandings but we do not know the cause of the chain of events from sonar exposure to stranding
1120600 the number of whales known to have been harmed by sonar is relatively small but until we know exactly how whales respond to sonar and what sound exposure causes these responses we cannot assess the full scope of the problem
1120601 we carefully reviewed the available evidence to measure the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer and could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1120602 at this point we recommend that men concerned about prostate cancer talk with their health care providers to make a decision based on their individual risk factors and personal preference
1120603 the incremental benefits of treatment for prostate cancer detected by screening are small to none
1120604 men should be informed of the gaps in the evidence and should be assisted in considering their personal preferences before deciding whether to be tested
1120605 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1120606 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1120607 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk

1120619 this would mean that we could deliver lower dosages of drugs to specific cells and tissues in the body and actually be more effective in treating the cancer
1120620 the long rod shaped structure of bacteria may help explain why print particles of higher aspect ratios are internalized more rapidly and effectively than lower aspect ratio particles
1120621 if we can design particles that rely on the same mechanisms that nature has perfected for bacteria we may unlock the key for delivering therapeutics more efficiently and effectively to treat and cure disease
1120622 we are delighted to contribute to the important work that professor desimone and his students are undertaking in the field of nanomedicine this work answers key questions about the role of particle shape and size that industry leaders have been asking for some time
1120623 physicians should use esas with caution based on the international guidelines for esa administration in cancer and on certain prognostic indicators to guide their use physicians need to identify the appropriate group of cancer patients who will benefit from esa administration while avoiding possible detrimental effects
1120624 were going back almost 10 million years before any previously described asian anthropoid
1120625 the new fossils from india are exciting because they show that the anthropoid lineage is much more ancient than we realized
1120626 most of the fossil record of ancient primates is made up of teeth because teeth are easy to preserve and hard
1120627 occasionally we get lucky enough to have a skull to work with but in this case a few teeth is all we have
1120628 from the tooth size and structure we can say something about the animals body weight and diet because teeth have crests that are differentially developed depending on whether they ate primarily insects leaves or fruit
1120629 for decades the medial temporal lobe structures have been linked to both memory and spatial cognition
1120630 so we set out to test how these two abilities related to one another and to the temporal lobe area of the brain
1120631 we concluded that the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are not essential for path integration since we showed that the tests could be successfully accomplished despite damage to these brain regions
1120632 we carefully reviewed the available evidence to measure the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer and could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1120633 at this point we recommend that men concerned about prostate cancer talk with their health care providers to make a decision based on their individual risk factors and personal preference
1120634 we may think we live in a fast moving hectic world but statistically our environment moves around us slowly
1120635 when an object moves quickly be it a football cricket ball or for our ancestors a spear our brains have to interpret the movement rapidly and because our brains draw on experience its often biased by what it already knows the less certain we are about what we see the more we are influenced by the brains statistical assumptions which means in some circumstances we get it wrong
1120636 although it is not surprising that sportsmen who practice a lot build up a better statistical picture in their minds about where a ball might go it is surprising that what should be a vital survival skill is based on such a trial and error learning experience
1120637 the research also has important long term application to robotics and assistive technologies capitalising on natures design is a good way of building artificial visual systems for robots as humans get visual judgments right a lot more often than the best current robot systems further knowing the situations in which humans get it wrong is a useful starting point for the design of assistive devices to help correct those errors before they have serious consequences
1120638 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1120639 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
1120640 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1120641 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
1120642 when i envision the future of robots i always think of the jetsons
1120643 george jetson never sat down at a computer to task rosie to clean the house
1120644 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us
1120645 but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention
1120646 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1120647 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
1120648 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1120649 clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled in the case series ascorbate was given orally and intravenously but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally it was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti tumor effect
1120650 nihs unique translational environment where researchers can pursue intellectual high risk out of the box thinking with high potential payoff enabled us to pursue this work
1120651 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas through space
1120652 we know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace
1120653 all of a sudden with genetics you can actually address that question
1120654 africa has the most genetic diversity in the world but it is one of the least studied places
1120655 ive always felt like there were a lot of stories there that nobodys had the time or interest to look into
1120656 the family tree of the y chromosome is very very clear
1120657 i like the fact that the linguistic genetic and archaeological evidence all line up
1120658 when you see lines of evidence converge on a single model it means thats probably something that actually happened
1120659 so rarely do we get to pin down the questions raised by archaeology
1120660 the molecular interaction in oxygen revealed by this study is due to the unique fact that oxygens outmost orbital is half filled with two unpaired electrons
1120661 as the molecules are squeezed into smaller volumes at high pressure electrons in the orbital inevitably move about trying to pair with electrons in the neighboring molecules
1120662 the behavior of oxygen at high pressure demonstrates one of the most profound effects of pressure on matter which transforms the colorless air we breath into colorful dense solids
1120663 the drastic change in the appearance of this familiar gas is due to the bonding changes in oxygen induced by high pressure
1120664 this is the first demonstration of how new tools can be used to probe the subtle interactions between atoms and molecules that lead to the formation of entirely new crystal structures
1120665 these new structures may give rise to entirely new electronic magnetic and other physical properties that could lead to new technologies
1120666 it is exciting to find that oxygen forms molecular clusters under high pressure through similar mechanism and this opens a possibility for new forms of materials at high pressure with potential for technical applications
1120667 our integration of arrays of nanowires that perform separate functions and are made of heterogeneous substances and doing this in a way that can be reproduced on a large scale in a controlled way is a first
1120668 but after contact printing the nanowires on the receiver substrate are highly aligned javey group
1120669 our main objective is a route toward integrated nanowire arrays that we can produce on any substrate even paper and to reproduce them uniformly on a large scale
1120670 to do that over the past two years our group has developed methods of printing nanowire arrays after first growing the nanowires on a donor substrate we transfer them to any desired substrate including paper or plastic
1120671 nanowires grow sticking out in random directions they look like a bad hair day
1120672 is like combing the hair to make it stand up straight
1120673 to fabricate the integrated circuitry we had to position the two kinds of materials at precise locations on the receiver substrate
1120674 the pattern for the device was on a photoresist layer coated on the substrate first we printed the cadmium selenide nanowires onto the substrate then removed the photoresist with acetone leaving the cadmium selenide nanowires exactly where we wanted them we repeated the process for the germanium silicon nanowires
1120675 in the future we can foresee using a variety of different optical sensors to create nanoscale devices sensitive to multiple colors in high resolution
1120676 and thats just the beginning we contemplate printing nanowire sensor circuitry photosensors chemical sensors biosensors not on silicon but on paper or plastic tape this could be used easily and with instant results where spills have occurred or to test air quality or to test for disease organisms almost any use for a sensor that you can imagine
1120677 i mean were supposedly all one family and we have what they want
1120678 we carefully reviewed the available evidence to measure the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer and could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1120679 at this point we recommend that men concerned about prostate cancer talk with their health care providers to make a decision based on their individual risk factors and personal preference

1120689 the end result of the compromise is that the user going through their normal course of activities is subject to a really massive installation of malicious files

1120704 i had earlier commented that a fair election is not possible under emergency but i am surprised to see fair elections have taken place in such circumstances
1120705 after the way elections have been held in the four city corporations and nine municipalities i do not see any problem in holding parliamentary elections in the same environment we would want that proper environment for voting to prevail
1120706 there may be ideological and psychological differences in opinion among different quarters regarding the state of emergency however practically speaking i do not see any problem
1120707 i have talked with many people none complained about the emergency the problem that exists is purely psychological
1120708 action will be taken even if they win if they lose cases would be filed against them
1120709 the political parties would have to think about the matter in future
1120710 the voters who came only with national id cards had to face some hassles at the polling centres due to delay in collecting their registration numbers
1120711 we will be more alert in this regard in future
1120712 it took more time to tally the six digit numbers and the women took more time in applying the seals to the ballot papers inside the booths
1120713 without bothering the boss get accurate directions to the club as well as have a sense of how formal the dress code is
1120714 i have won a couple and lost a couple it is all about the competition successful people love competition
1120715 it really turns me off more than anything when a subordinate uses golf to prove he or she is in with the boss
1120716 if colleagues ask you about the round of golf treat it as if it were no big deal
1120717 in addition do not discuss the boss performance if he or she had a bad round if the boss played well say so
1120718 the plan sets out building heights transport infrastructure and land use and features guidance for large areas of traditional housing the newly formed urban planning council will oversee implementation of the plan
1120719 mubadala development co which manages over 10bn in assets will fund the construction of the offshore island which will be developed by john buck international a joint venture mubadala which was formed earlier this year with chicago based property firm the john buck co
1120720 it is a multi billion dirham development and construction has already started the island will be home to the new headquarters of the abu dhabi securities exchange the 570 000sqm development will include commercial and residential buildings as well as a hotel and retail space
1120721 there is tremendous demand for commercial real estate in abu dhabi fuelled by the growth of the economy
1120722 here we will use a two stage strategy where the infrastructure will be funded by the company later on we will engage other developers and market investors for another source of funding
1120723 the concept looks original and forward thinking and we are delighted to add the shaikh mohammad bin rashid gardens to our expanding database of properties in dubai and from across the united arab emirates
1120724 the new green development in dubai will be divided into four differently themed areas wisdom nature humanity and commerce with all four having an iconic building as its centre piece as well as commercial educational and residential property for sale
1120725 germanys lufthansa airlines which already flies to dubai daily from frankfurt announced new service from munich additionally indian carrier jet airways announced flights to abu dhabi from mumbai and delhi and is in negotiations to fly directly to dubai
1120726 jet airways will launch two direct daily flights from abu dhabi to mumbai and delhi on april 23 and is waiting for the negotiations to conclude for launching routes from dubai as well
1120727 based on my past and how my last album came out i really need to come back much much stronger i wanted to have more personality i really want to tell a story when im doing a song vocally either you like my voice or you dont im not trying to blow like mariah back when she was doing that
1120728 shes fu for checks i dont f for rather live on the street
1120729 whats funny about it is when i was growing up i wasnt confused i knew exactly what i was my dads filipino my mom is mexican west indian and a little melting pot in school you were either black or white being asian really wasnt anything until i got to high school and was modeling all the time and it was important because it intrigued people black people definitely didnt claim me before they were like light skinned over there shes just not for us its all perception the other day i was at the drugstore and this girl in line was like shes next the white girl im not white im not even close
1120730 shes fu for checks i dont f for rather live on the street
1120731 it would be nice if you didnt come back at all
1120732 two years have elapsed since the case was filed no charge sheet was submitted either
1120733 there was no specific allegation against mohammad nasim besides he was seriously ill his life may be threatened if he is not given better treatment abroad
1120734 it is known to everyone that no election camp can be set up in front of the polling centres still associates of candidates tried to do so to influence the voters arriving to cast votes
1120735 there are allegations that they even threatened the voters and misbehaved with rab personnel too
1120736 so what ngga pake gitchu loh it is not a bad thing
1120737 berdebar2 juga denger true story dari kk gue dimana dia pernah mengalami semalaman ngga tidur mungkin feeling intuisi yang bicara dan dia berdoa sepanjang malam sambil menunggu pagi tiba demi menangkal gangguan itu itu pun yang dilakukan sepanjang malam ketika kk gw d menunggu dia n di rumah sakit trus berdoa sepanjang malem supaya gangguan itu ngga datang menyerang
1120738 kan bukan mau saya untuk begini saya ngga mau seperti ini
1120739 i dont care to sit by the window on an airplane if i cant control it why look
1120740 i make these little plans that really dont have any importance to anyone else and then feel compelled to carry them out
1120741 kayanya selama ini gue baik baik aja deh ngga ada yang salah kok dengan diri gue
1120742 selama gue tidak melakukan tindakan kriminal dan tidak merugikan orang lain kenapa juga musti pusing repot amat toh selama ini gue merasa puas kok dengan apa yang ada dalam diri gue dan ga ada yang perlu gue rubah karena gue ya begini ini
1120743 please dech secara gue narcissist gitu loohh ga penting banget dech dipikirin biarpun seluruh dunia penuh dengan orang cantik pintar jenius dan hebat tapi tetap gue punya dunia sendiri yang mencerminkan gue lah yang paling hebat
1120744 sekarang yang ada pada diri gue hanyalah rasa kagum dan pemujaan setinggi langit terhadap betapa indahnya anugrah tuhan yang diberikan kepada gue
1120745 bila orang memuji gue maka gue masih tanpa sungkan berkata

1120768 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins
1120769 ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth
1120770 but he that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost hath never forgiveness but is in danger of eternal damnation
1120771 and if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched and if thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched
1120772 and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this
1120773 and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall

1120777 and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christs sake for when i am weak then am i strong
1120778 this i recall to my mind therefore have i hope it is of the lords mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness the lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will i hope in him
1120779 let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice
1120780 great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them
1120781 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places
1120782 i felt that since we represented defense with our gloves we should do something to honor the best in that area
1120783 and what better way than with a glove a golden glove at that
1120784 at the time it was very common for pitchers to throw out to the umpire baseballs that would be doctored in some way to affect the pitching
1120785 when you look around mount prospect you see my dad
1120786 he really had a youthful spirit about him he was very proud of that gold glove
1120787 at no time should the american homemaker be at a loss for variety in preparing food for her family since she has a wealth of fish and seafood at her command and we who live along the seashore are at a greater advantage because we are so close to the supply however modern refrigerated facilities can quickly bring these briny morsels to inlanders while the world sleeps
1120788 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour whom resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world

1120799 quieter feet dont be bouncing forward in the pocket into traffic as he did at times last year the theory is if he stays back he might have another split second before the pass rush gets to him
1120800 every offseason i go into it thinking what can i do to get better
1120801 this year i looked at my games last season and saw on my seven step drops i was setting up bouncing around looking at my options 1 2 3 4 and moving up in the pocket
1120802 ive moved way up see i better throw it now or the pockets gonna collapse on me
1120803 what i was doing was creating pressure where there should be none when i watched film i wanted to change that
1120804 and as i watched film of other quarterbacks i noticed one
1120805 why should they give bashir 12 months of grace when in 5 years we have not known one day of peace
1120806 my hope for the future is that there will be peace in darfur so that we can go home for there to be peace the president of sudan must be arrested and taken to court he has caused so much suffering omar al bashir has killed children he has bombed us and terrified us he should be taken and executed
1120807 the rebels formed when people of darfur began to understand they have no rights al bashir is trying to kill the people not just the rebels he is bombing civilians
1120808 not only al bashir but 52 more should be taken to court
1120809 we want two things peace in sudan and punishment for al bashir and all the criminals who have done this to us
1120810 we need security and peace security cannot be delivered by the au they have watched us die for 5 years and we need not the hybrid but an international peacekeeping
1120811 to make a living in a place like this is a joy a pleasure a blessing
1120812 the african american community is as american as apple pie
1120813 it seems he is getting better as he bowled well in nets and felt no pain today monday he shortened his run up as a precautionary measure

1120819 when you travel the byroads of central russia you begin to understand the secret of the pacifying russian countryside it is in the churches they lift their bell towers graceful shapely all different high over mundane timber and thatch from villages that are cut off and invisible to each other they soar to the same heaven t he evening chimes used to ring out floating over the villages fields and woods reminding men that they must abandon trivial concerns of this world and give time and thought to eternity
1120820 while the american people know that there are people out there getting shot and killed and wounded i dont think they feel it

1120825 with the new restrictions implemented by the airlines the last thing you want to worry about is cramming your gear into one suitcase having your bag exceed the weight limit and being charged a high fine
1120826 always confirm in advance with your airline what their specific regulations restrictions are and especially now make sure you know exactly what if anything it will cost you to check your bags or if they are overweight
1120827 the key to packing the perfect suitcase is doing your homework before you go on your trip
1120828 it is a suitcase not your closet i can travel for a month in a 22 rolling bag and have everything i need it is about need not want pack only for your planned activities and logical possibilities such as rain

1121073 ja toe hy nog in ons skool was was sy parties die grootste en wildste van almal al die ouens raak gesuip en al die girls raak maklik
1121074 anyway soos ek ges het dis gewoonlik n moerse party en dis wanneer sy ouers daar is vanaand gaan hulle nie eens daar wees nie so dinge beloof om heeltemal hand uit te ruk daarom wil ek jou n guns vra

1121079 man as jy dit nie wil doen nie los dit
1121080 whoa sorry ou dis nie wat ek het nie bedoel sorry
1121081 let me rephrase ek het iemand nodig om te kyk laat my girl nie n ander gomgat van ewoud heymans vry nie wihan en sibu is so jags soos plaaskatte en daarom gaan hulle self te besig wees om chicks te soek dat ek hulle nie gaan vra nie dis vir jou n geleentheid om nuwe mense te ontmoet en die sosiale kringe van bergkruin te betree al wat ek vra is dat jy af en toe met rozaan sal gesels sodat die ouens dalk dink julle twee het iets aan en haar dan uitlos ek weet mos nou van beter
1121082 dis reg juan sorry oor netnou en jys reg dis nie maklik om met mense te gesels as hulle net in jou rugbyprestasies vaskyk nie

1121100 hy ek en hy het vanmiddag na skool n bietjie gesels en goed en ek weet dit klink weird omdat ons die eerste slag toe ons mekaar ontmoet het nou nie juis gebond het nie maar ek dink dat ons dalk p lle kan wees as ek nou sy meisie sou vry dit sou dinge net opneuk
1121101 dis nie dit nie glo my onthou ek het ook nog n meisie ons sou albei nou gecheat het besef jy dit en ek dink nie dat juan of my meisie dit van ons verdien nie wat dink jy
1121102 sien ek en juan het op n vreeslike romantiese noot afgeskop en alles was net perfek jy weet ons was di couple toe die skool weer begin het almal het ges ons pas so goed bymekaar en alles was net soos dit moet wees
1121103 want ek is nie seker hoe ek oor hom voel nie ek dink hy is liewer vir my as ek vir hom en ek is bang sy jaloesie vernietig ons altwee
1121104 dis die grootste klomp crap wat ek nog van n girl af gehoor het
1121105 ja okay vergeet van die jaloesie stukkie maar die res is actually waar hy is n moerse nice ou en alles ek is net nie heeltemal seker of ek reg is om die verhouding ernstiger te neem nie
1121106 nou vir wat s jy dit nie reguit vir hom nie ons ouens like dit as girls ons in hulle vertroue neem weet jy
1121107 ek bedoel ek is reg oor hoe ons ouens dink

1121125 ek het dit geweet toe vry jy haar sommer net daar in die straat lekker man
1121126 ek het haar nie sommer net daar in die straat gevry nie dis nie hoe dit is nie
1121127 ek dink ek like haar ek ken haar al lankal van sien en so en sy is moer mooi sy is nie soos die ander meisies in graad nege nie sy het actually breins
1121128 ag voertsek man ek s mos ons het nie gevry nie sys n goeie meisie en dis nie asof ek haar net wil score en los nie
1121129 dinge by hulle huis is nie lekker nie en as jy haar gaan gebruik gaan ek jou net m t donder
1121130 ek s mos ek gaan nie haar huislike omstandighede be nvloed my in anyway indirek ook my pa werk vir haar pa onthou so wanneer di toppie n moeilike dag het haal hy dit op sy werknemers uit en dan kry ons dit by die huis ook
1121131 jip en deesdae is hy besonder edgy en wanneer ek s edgy bedoel ek kind of gesuip by die werk
1121132 wat no ways nie oom martin nie ek weet dinge is nou nie altyd tien vier daar by hulle huis nie maar ek kan nie dink dat hy n suiplap is nie ek ken die oom hulle is kerkmense en alles

1121136 dis nie so eenvoudig nie lisa ek kan self nie glo daai rufus is so n goody goody ek wil nie op my girl wat vrek ver is cheat nie hy het dit so verkeerd laat klink
1121137 ag toe jy was saam my van die begin af in die hele ding in moenie nou maak asof jy so onskuldig is nie anyway dit gaan nie oor rufus nie dit gaan oor juan ek meen hy bly n nice ou en alles maar ek voel nog dat ek nie meer langer met hierdie verhouding wil aangaan nie i need my space
1121138 jy weet as juan dinge dalk al verder gevat het nie
1121139 wel jy wou vir rufus agter die bosse by jacques se huis invat
1121140 yeah right almal weet dat vry maar net die eerste ding is wat n mens agter daardie bosse doen jy ook
1121141 ja okay miskien sou dit dinge anders gemaak het maar nou het dit nie gebeur met juan f rufus nie buitendien juan is deesdae te broody na my sin
1121142 die vo ltjies fluit dis omdat sy pa deesdae s dronk by die huis aankom dat hy nie op sy voete kan staan nie maak glo tot vier bottels whisky n dag op kantoor klaar alleen
1121143 dis die waarheid klink my juan het eintlik nou sy girl nodig
1121144 well boo frikkedy hoo ons almal het ons probleme en ek gaan verseker nie juan se crutch wees nie ek dink dis tyd dat ek hierdie verhouding be indig voordat hy begin dink ek gaan daar wees vir hom deur sy donker swaar dae
1121145 thanks ek wou sommer by jou kom hoor oor daai wiskunde huiswerk van juffrou bezuidenhout vir m re ek het nie n cooking clue wat daar aangaan nie jy kan my nie dalk help nie

1121148 ons probeer om saam saam so deur die goed te struggle
1121149 nee wat ek drink mos nie eintlik koffie nie ek gaan sommer net n vrug vat
1121150 rufus het sy nie nou net daarbo heel eerste ges sy wil koffie h nie
1121151 hmm ek wonder weet jy dalk wat dit kan wees leon
1121152 ag ek sommer net gewonder hoekom jou ore so rooi is
1121153 nee nee hoekom wat gaan aan het iets gebeur rufus
1121154 rufus het my saterdagaand by jacques se party eenkant toe gevat en toe het ons mekaar gesoen lank aanhoudend hy het vir jou gelieg als was nie fine nie d s hoekom ek met jou uitmaak o en rufus ek stel ook nie regtig in jou belang nie want jy vry moer lekker maar die seks was crappy ciao
1121155 hierdie bliksem het nie net my girl op jacques se party gevry nie hy het sommer haar virgin gevat ook en dan het hy die flippen audacity om vir my daarna te sms dat sy veilig is
1121156 sy lieg sy lieg ek het haar nie gevry nie en ek het beslis nie met haar seks gehad nie flip ou jy het my dan vertrou hoekom sou ek vir jou daaroor jok
1121157 ek en rozaan was wel agter die bosse in op jacques se party
1121158 ja ons was alleen en ja niemand kon ons sien nie die versoeking om haar te score was moer groot dit erken ek maar ek het nie sy het haar arms om my nek gesit en ek het haar nie gevry nie en dit was nie omdat my eie girl ver is nie maar omdat jy juan my voor die party gevra het om haar op te pas sodat n ander ou dit nie dalk doen nie toe frans vir haar gemik het met die simpel boudbyt sessie het ek hom uit die pad gestamp sodat hy dit nie kon doen nie toe ons agter die bosse gestaan het het ons op die ou end net gepraat en het ek vir haar ges dat ek dit nie aan jou kan doen nie omdat ek graag met jou p lle wil wees ek het vir haar ges nie jy of my girl verdien dit dat ons op julle sou cheat nie sy was die een wat ges het ons moet hande vashou as ons daar agter uitkom sodat dit die unwanted attention kan keer
1121159 flip ouens ek weet nie hoekom glo julle my nie ek probeer vriende maak maar dis donners moeilik as almal jou die heeltyd judge en uitcheck en net wag dat jy n voet verkeerd sit oe jy kom mos van waterkloof af wil julle weet hoekom ons uit pretoria getrek het my ouers het nie n prokureurspraktyk hier gekoop nie dit was die enigste ding waaroor ek vir julle gejok het my ouers is geskei en my pa het ons amper kaal uitgetrek my motorfiets het ek met erfgeld van my oorlede oupa gekoop dis hoekom ek hom kon hou maar my ma het niks oor nie sy het werk gekry by die blerrie till in checkers ons bly in n tweeslaapkamerwoonstel en ons het die klere aan ons lywe en dit wat in n tas kon kom dis hoekom ek nie by my ou skool aangebly het nie want daar was nie geld nie ja daar was sponsors wat my daar sou kon hou maar hulle was vriende van my pa en met sy contacts het hy hulle almal laat onttrek die hele saak het so vinnig gebeur en toe ek weer sien is ons hier en moet ek probeer om die beste te maak van n situasie waaroor ek geen beheer het nie en die beste was toe ek vroe r vanaand n sms van my girl in pretoria af kry wat s dat sy en een van my beste vriende saamgeslaap het en nou n item is ek vra jou weer hoekom sou ek vir jou jok juan
1121160 ek dink ek verstaan tjom my ma het ons gelos nadat sy vir die grootste deel van my lewe haarself soos n hoer gedra het en my pa is nou nie juis n treat nie
1121161 my pa het begin om heavy te drink en ons te slaan en hy vloek my vloek my sodat die see my nie kan afwas nie
1121162 here jesus ons is stukkend ons girls los ons en jok vir ons ons ouers verwerp ons en breek ons af en die druk om te presteer laat ons dom dinge doen maar here u s vir ons dat u ons las kom dra as ons dit na u toe bring ons bring dit vanaand na u toe here al ons hartseer ons slegte gewoontes al die dom goed wat ons aanvang om ons ouers en die w reld te probeer impress here ons is moeg daarvoor om te voel dat ons nie goed genoeg is nie ons is moeg daarvoor om die heeltyd onsself te moet bewys aan ander sodat hulle ons kan aanvaar help ons asseblief jesus want alleen kan ons nie meer nie
1121163 ek moes geweet het sy is besig om te lieg
1121164 met my girl wat my ook vanaand gelos het het ons nogal baie dieselfde tipe crap om mee te deal
1121165 ek het daai aand van die party gel en bybel lees toe lees ek van dani l en sy drie vriende en hoe hulle getrou gebid het maybe moet ons dit ook meer gereeld so saam doen
1121166 klink vir my na n goeie plan ons kan sommer in die middae as ons van oefening af kom bymekaarkom ons moet net hierdie clown in ag neem
1121167 nie dat ek dink hy sal mind om saam met n klomp bergkruin manne te bid nie of hoe
1121168 nee wat dis okay dink julle ek kan vir frans saambring
1121169 ek weet nie ons het nog nooit regtig oor hierdie goed gepraat nie
1121170 en sibu ook wihan jy moet hom net s tune hom ons sal saam met hom die tokkelossie wegbid
1121171 eks ook bly dat rozaan jou gelos het want ek like haar niks nie maar ek is veral bly dat julle ouens mekaar kon vind en vir jesus in julle lewens begin insluit het sulke ouens is enige ordentlike girl se droom
1121172 ek is ook bly ons het eintlik nogal baie in gemeen so dis lekker om dit met ander ouens te kan deel dis amper soos n soort band of brothers
1121173 ironies dat die leuen wat rozaan vertel het om ons uit mekaar te dryf juis die ding was wat ons ouens aan mekaar gebind het maar nou ja ek is baie moeg lekker slaap sussie
1121174 hoeveel is hierdie rugbyweek vir julle werd ek vra vir elkeen van julle vanmiddag wat is jy bereid om op te offer vir n wen vir jou span vir jou skool vir jou dorp dis nou vier jaar vandat ons skool laas die trofee aan die einde van die week omhoog kon hou ek weet dat ons as span die potensiaal het om dit weer te kan doen maar as ons nie elke greintjie energie wat ons het hiervoor gaan insit nie gaan ons misluk ons m t met elke wedstryd ons lles gee die aantal drie wat ons druk is belangrik hoe meer hoe beter die aantal strafskoppe wat ons afstaan is net so belangrik ek gaan nie eens praat oor geel of rooi kaarte nie ons dissipline m t te alle tye honderd persent wees ek weet dat elkeen van julle dit in julle het soos wat julle hier sit beskik elkeen oor die potensiaal om hierdie droom van ons te laat slaag maar dan moet ons saamwerk om my te help en om julle te help om saam te werk het ons natuurlik ons kaptein en onderkaptein en ek het doelbewus tot nou toe gewag om hulle aan te kondig
1121175 ek weet julle wonder hoekom ek vir wihan onderkaptein gemaak het en my redes is my eie ek het die volste vertroue dat hy julle sal kan lei saam met jonathan en ek verwag van elkeen om hom te respekteer vir die posisie waarin hy aangestel is jonathan wihan iets wat julle vir die span wil s
1121176 as ons elkeen uit ons hart uit speel gaan dit n great week wees kom ons wen hierdie ding
1121177 rufus het darem entoesiasme maar ek soek dit saam jonno van julle elkeen as ons hierdie ding s m doen dan gaan ons dit wen yes
1121178 en heroes is nie mense wat terugstaan as daar iets groots voor hulle l nie kom ons pak hierdie week by die horings en stoei hom in die grond in
1121179 lets do this voor ons loop kom ons bid net eers saam sodat ons hierdie bul op die regte manier kan aanpak
1121180 sodat alles wat ons doen op en af van die veld tot eer van u naam sal wees amen
1121181 manne vanaand is ons aand al wat ek wil s is dat elkeen sy kant moet bring just play it boys just go for it and be your best i expect nothing less
1121182 dink jy nie ook hulle is besig om naam weg te gooi nie
1121183 ek hoop hulle regroup n bietjie nou met halftyd maar gepraat van naam weggooi het jy daai corna girl gesien sy en so n ander clown wat lyk asof hy 30 is het netnou daar langs die veld gel en mekaar s bevoel dat ek gedink het iemand gaan die polisie bel en hulle aankla van public indecency
1121184 gmf ja en rozaan is nie ver agter nie hoor sy het kort na die opening met omtrent vier kuswag ouens gelyk begin flirt sy en een van hulle het daar op die punt gaan sit kyk daar hy kan ook omtrent nie sy hande van haar afhou nie
1121185 wihan jy moet my n s of jy die pressure kan vat want as jy nie kan nie moet ons n plan maak
1121186 ek kan dit doen jonno ek moet net myself agtermekaar kry
1121187 nou kry jouself dan agtermekaar ek gaan in as jy inkom beter jy reg wees anders moet jy glad nie inkom nie ons kan nie bekostig om vanaand te verloor nie en jy weet dit
1121188 here jesus ek is jammer dat ek dit alles oor myself laat word het
1121189 ek weet u het hierdie span met n rede aan my toevertrou en ek is so vrek bang ek skroef dit op asseblief here maak my rustig help my om kalm te bly en te fokus op dit wat ek moet doen sodat ek u naam kan groot maak deur my spel help ook die ander ouens asseblief here laat ons die eer aan u gee ek bid dit in u naam amen
1121190 sorry rufus dit was eintlik vir die poepol langs jou bedoel lekker mis geskop vanaand n wihan jy sien dis wat gebeur as jy net onder kaptein is omdat jou pa die skool omgekoop het
1121191 los dit wihan die klein snotkop weet nie waarvan hy praat nie
1121192 dink julle ouens ek is onder kaptein omdat my pa ryk is
1121193 ag asseblief ou niemand gee groter borge as my pa nie en ek het dit nie gemaak nie ek bedoel wat het jou pa vir die skool geskenk die lapa
1121194 ja okay maar ek wonder nog hoekom het venter my onder kaptein gemaak onthou julle hy het ges sy redes is sy eie nou flippen staan almal en skinder dat my pa hom omgekoop het
1121195 ou vat dit van my af daar gaan altyd stories wees veral as n mens dit nogal groot maak mense like dit om die ouens op wie hulle jaloers is sleg te laat lyk selfs al beteken dit hulle moet iets uitlieg mense is weird goed skinder is vir die meeste mense soos soos wat gym vir leon is hulle kan nie daarsonder klaarkom nie en hulle gee ook nie regtig om wie in die proses aftjop nie
1121196 almal se moere dis m re die boot out daar sal ek vir hulle wys ek k n skop en dat ek my plek in die span en my onder kapteinskap verdien
1121197 ja wat dankie wil jy nie vir ons nog n shooter gaan kry nie
1121198 hoekom nogal nie ek k n bestuur ek h t karre karrrre ek het k n self regkom
1121199 ek is dalk dronk maar k kan bestuur ek is nie n flop nie my seun het dalk vanaand soos n stuk stront gespeel hel hy s een maar ek is nie ek is nie ek is n sukses sukses
1121200 ons hoef nie lank te bly nie ons moes eintlik al terug gewees het daar by daai koshuis waar ons slaap maar ons sal net insneak dan word ons coach nie wakker nie
1121201 daar was n moerse ongeluk in kerkstraat twee karre en n beeslorrie het almal mekaar getref juan jou pa was in die ongeluk en rozaan
1121202 ons het nou net die nuus gekry jou ma het vir venter gebel ons weet net dis bad juan
1121203 ons sal saam kom ek en wihan ek gaan hom net gou wakker maak
1121204 hy moet m re goed doen in die boot out hy het sy rus nodig hy moenie nou oor my worry nie
1121205 trek gou julle sweetpakke aan dan kry ek julle voor ons ry sommer met my kar
1121206 sy sit hier om die draai leon is by haar hy het nog by ons huis koffie gedrink toe ons die nuus gekry het
1121207 rozaan hulle was vyf mense in die kar sy en lisa en so n ander ou van kuswag het saam met jacques en skalla in jacques se convertible gery ons dink hulle was heel moontlik op pad bucks toe jou pa was in die ander kar en dan was daar die beeslorrie
1121208 lisa en die kuswag ou is op slag dood sy naam was wayne hulle het agter in gesit maar die beestrok was leeg en het half op sy kant bo op die convertible geval en hulle getref die ander weet ons nog nie regtig iets van nie
1121209 dis presies die donnerse tipe ding wat my pa sal aanvang seker lekker gesuip gewees bliksem
1121210 ou s my reguit hoe erg is die ander mense
1121211 die kans dat al die ander mense in die karre dit gaan maak is op hierdie stadium bitter skraal die lorriedrywer is fine hy het net n paar snye en kneusplekke en n gekraakte rib of so iets jacques was nog conscious toe die medical rescue op die toneel opgedaag het maar hy was baie deurmekaar en het die heeltyd onverstaanbare goed ges skalla se sitplek het met die slag heeltemal agtertoe geskuif en rozaan se bene vergruis sy was nog bewusteloos toe hulle met haar hier aangekom het maar die dokters is op die oomblik besig om haar te stabiliseer hulle het iets ges van albei haar bene van onder haar knie af amputeer

1121228 ons gaan m re kapitaliseer op daai ouens se misery dis kind of siek
1121229 ons moenie laat emosies en sulke goed in ons pad kom nie
1121230 man wag dat ek klaar praat ons moenie dat dit in ons pad kom terwyl ons die wedstryd speel nie dis mos nie asof ons nou conveniently vergeet het dat hulle deur n heavy tyd gaan nie hel ons het ook nie juis n piekniek nie een van die girls in ons skool is ook oorlede ons een speler se pa se lewe hang aan n draadjie ons word k geraak ons het ons eie emosies om mee te deal
1121231 ek hoor jou maar ek is net bevrees hulle gaan dit nie so insien nie dit kan in n baie fisiese game ontaard en met fisies bedoel ek ons gaan mekaar waarskynlik op die ou end goed moer
1121232 o ja vir daai ouens is dit asof ns hulle buitesenter vermoor het dink jy nie hulle gaan ons probeer terugkry nie
1121233 die ref s dat hy niks sien wat kuswag verkeerd doen nie en dat as ons nie n harde game kan vat nie kan hy niks daaraan doen nie
1121234 i know sibu but calm down ouens as ons hierdie game wil wen sonder om iemand te verloor gaan ons baie vaster as n span moet saam speel ons gaan na mekaar moet kyk ons kan nie toelaat dat hulle ons ouens uithaal omdat hulle met n spul aggressie sit nie dis nie ons skuld wat maandagaand gebeur het nie juan jy is nie n moordenaarskind nie hoor jy my jy is n held n freakin hero nie een van ons kan verantwoordelikheid vat vir ons ouers of ander ouens se keuses nie wat ons kan doen is om hier nou vir mekaar verantwoordelikheid te vat gaan ons dit doen

1121236 juan ek wil nie h jy moet verplig voel om te speel nie ek en die hele span sal honderd persent verstaan as jy eerder hospitaal toe wil gaan en by jou pa wil wees
1121237 nee meneer ek wil nie daar wees nie ek wil hier by die span wees ek kan hulle nie in die steek laat nie nie nou nie
1121238 jy is welkom om my te laat weet as jy van plan verander onthou net ons kan nie bekostig dat iets soos vanaand weer gebeur nie n opponent se gesig is nie die plek om jou frustrasies uit te haal nie ons doen dit deur hulle hard te tackle en gate deur hulle te hardloop hulle uit te haal daar waar dit saak maak jonathan ek los jou nog so n bietjie by hom
1121239 onthou jy wat het ek vir jou halftyd ges juan
1121240 helde maak nie so nie juan regte helde wenners is die ouens wat die punch vat ek s nie almal moet oor jou loop nie glad nie maar helde verloor nie beheer oor hulself omdat die een of ander random poepol iets oor jou kwytgeraak het wat doodgewoon nie die waarheid is nie dis iets wat my broer my geleer het jy vat verantwoordelikheid vir jou eie optrede as ander ouens hulleself soos kinders wil gedra is dit hulle saak
1121241 onthou jy so n paar jaar gelede was daar een van die eerstespan ouens wat kort na rugbyweek gequit het en toe het almal so heavy oor hom begin skinder ges hy is gay dat hy eintlik net rugby gespeel het om aan ouens te vat sulke stront
1121242 ja dit was my ouer broer ons verskil so vyf jaar hy het nie gequit omdat hy gay was of iets nie hy het gequit omdat hy homself nie op daardie stadium met die ouens kon assosieer nie dit was nie soos nou wat ons so baie bid tydens oefeninge en sulke goed nie dit was baie rowwer tye en hy het net gevoel sy geestelike lewe gaan te veel skade ly
1121243 jip hy het my geleer dat jy verantwoordelikheid vir jou eie keuses vat maak nie saak wat ander mense vir jou of van jou s of aan jou doen nie op die ou end is dit jy wat besluit gaan ek die punch kan vat of gaan ek knak onder die druk en maar met die res van die stroom saamdryf
1121244 presies d s wat ware helde doen hy het geweet hy gaan dit vir homself vrek moeilik maak maar hy het ges dit pla hom nie want hy weet wat die waarheid is as n mens die waarheid aan jou kant het juan kan niemand jou vrede van jou af wegvat nie jy kan dan net kies of jy mense wil toelaat om dit van jou af weg te vat
1121245 my broer is einde laas jaar in amerika in n motorongeluk dood ek kon hom nie eens groet nie maar ek het vrede in my hart my broer het my iets geleer wat ek nogal bly is ek aan iemand anders kon oordra

1121260 ek praat nie van die ongeluk nie ek bedoel ek is jammer daaroor ook maar ek wil eintlik kom jammer s oor die aand by jacques se party
1121261 ek is jammer dat ek jou omgepraat het om reguit vir juan te s hoe jy voel
1121262 dis nie jou skuld nie rufus dis nie jy wat moet jammer s nie ek het my eie keuses gemaak niemand het my gedwing nie ek het self in jacques se kar geklim ek het geweet hoe dronk hulle is ek w met juan uitmaak onthou jy ek w vry wees maar ek was nooit vry nie ek het n klomp goed gedoen wat ek gedink het vir my vryheid sou beteken maar dit het my net in die een slaggat na die ander gelei weet jy wie van die skoolkinders het al vir my kom kuier vandat ek hier l juan en jy my beste vriendin is dood en sy word op n ander dorp veras en ek kan dit nie bywoon nie en nie n van my sogenaamde vriende het nog kom kyk hoe dit met my gaan nie en juan mens kan dit ook nie juis n kuier noem nie
1121263 dat julle nie kon gesels nie of eerder dat jy nie met hom wou praat nie
1121264 ek wil net laastens s ek is jammer dat jy en juan nie meer p lle is nie hy wil graag h dat julle darem nog vriende moet wees weet jy
1121265 ek gaan nou terug koshuis toe juan het vanaand n ou op die rugbyveld gebliksem omdat die ou hom n moordenaarskind genoem het ek wil nog gaan kyk of hy oraait is ek sal weer n draai kom maak
1121266 s vir juan dit sal lekker wees om hom weer te sien
1121267 die dokters is heeltyd by hom hy praat deurmekaar en ag juan
1121268 hoe pa gaan pa ophou drink gaan pa ophou om ons te slaan gaan pa my begin liefkry hoe gaan dinge anders wees
1121269 dis net ek weet nie hoe dinge beter gaan word nie pa kan dit nou belowe maar as pa eers weer gesond is en alles is fine hoe weet ek dit gaan nie weer gebeur nie
1121270 ons was nie saam in nie maar toe juan uitkom het hy net ges dat wel dat hy alles opgemors het kom ons s maar net dit
1121271 ek dink nie hy en sy pa gaan ooit eye to eye sien nie ek twyfel in die eerste plek of sy pa dit gaan maak en selfs al doen hy wat is die kans dat dinge ooit weer tussen hulle kan regkom
1121272 en wat is reg sit ons nie almal maar met ons pas vas nie
1121273 sy pa sal hulle net weer op n stadium begin donder
1121274 ek ken daai oom ongelukkig al lank en hy het baie mense vir n lang tyd n groot rat voor die o gedraai my ma hulle ingesluit ek besef nou hy is een van daardie blink gladde tipe ouens wat n moerse masker vir die buitew reld voorhou met sy garage en sy gholfstokke en sy blink kar en alles maar binnekant is hy eintlik n monster hulle verander nie dalk vir n rukkie maar dan is alles net weer soos dit voorheen was
1121275 ek bedoel ek het ook nie juis n piekniek vir n lewe nie maar ten minste weet ek waarmee ek elke dag moet deal juan dit verbaas my dat hy nog nie weggeloop het uit die huis nie
1121276 maybe is dit beter as sy pa flip ek voel skoon skuldig om dit eens te dink
1121277 dalk s dit beter ek hoop net juan sal met homself kan vrede maak as dit sou gebeur
1121278 ek weet dit ek hoop net hy besef dit ook
1121279 ons gaan vandag geniet oraait ons gaan ski en tube ry en braai en op wihan hulle se jetski rondspeel ek wil nie die heeldag soos n pity case behandel word nie asseblief

1121286 hoe het dit gebeur meneer hulle het dan nie n bonuspunt gekry in hulle laaste game nie
1121287 in n verrassende upset het bothaville vir maritzburg geklop en op punteverskil het ewoud heymans een drie meer as maritzburg aangeteken
1121288 dis nou as leon nie vir j hard tackle nie
1121289 never he will have to catch me first ek hardloop sy sleutelbeen vir hom moer toe
1121290 nee nee dis my skuld ek moes nie ag nee dis my skuld
1121291 as ek hom nie beskuldig het nie sou hy dalk nog
1121292 juan sy beserings was net t erg dis nie jou skuld nie ou
1121293 maar ek het ges ek weet nie hoe hy sy beloftes gaan nakom nie
1121294 ons mag nie ingaan nie maar jou ma en marli is binne
1121295 ja ons het jou probeer bel en alles maar jou foon was af en
1121296 boeta hy het vir ons ges hy is jammer hy het ges dat hy nie vir jou kwaad is nie dat hy eintlik s trots op jou is en dat ons vir jou moet s hys lief vir jou
1121297 ja regtig ag boeta hy het so seer gehad n mens kon sien dis beter dat hy dat hy weg is
1121298 jy kan dit mos nie van hom verwag nie ou is jy mal
1121299 ons sal re l dan jol ons dit net later ons is mos albei spanne hier op die dorp
1121300 but what about the week are they just gonna end it
1121301 nee sibu hulle sal seker net die uitspeel vir derde en vierde plek die hoofgame maak
1121302 hey almal van julle hou net op met nonsens praat
1121303 ek ken vir juan hy sal speel hy sal die span nie in die steek laat nie en sal dit as n klap in die gesig beskou as ons die game ter wille van hom uitstel want dit sal beteken dat ons k nie dink dat hy dit het wat dit vat nie nee ek ken hom hy sal w l speel en ons kan nie namens hom besluit en die game uitstel nie
1121304 nee maar hy kan nie speel in so n emosionele toestand nie dis klaar nie goed vir die span se gees nie as ons m re wil wen het ons nie sy negatiewe invloed nodig nie hoe hartseer dit ookal is ons kan nie hierdie kans om te wen deur ons vingers laat glip nie
1121305 gaan alles vir meneer en die hele donnerse dorp net oor wen wen wen
1121306 ek het klaar gepraat ek stel voor jy gaan vat n stort en kalmeer sonder om verder iets te s waaroor jy spyt gaan wees en voordat ek besluit om jou onderkapteinskap van jou af weg te vat
1121307 wat de hel hoe kan venter sommer net so besluit wat hy dink goed sal wees vir juan
1121308 venter probeer ook maar net die beste keuse vir die span maak wihan onthou as ons wen is dit ons wat goed doen maar as ons verloor s almal dis sy skuld hy is ook onder pressure
1121309 hoekom kan ons nie net speel en dit goed doen na die beste van ons vermo en dit net geniet en wen as ons die beste is nie hoekom moet daar altyd een of ander asshole wees wat kyk waar hy iets uit dit uit kan maak
1121310 partykeer nee meeste van die tyd is dit die dinge wat heeltemal buite ons beheer is wat ons die ergste afpis en dan moet iemand die punch vat as ons ten minste net vir mekaar die shots vat die kere wat ons dit actually k n doen dan help dit al klaar
1121311 julle weet partykeer dink ek die here is verantwoordelik vir alles en dat hy al die toutjies trek en dat dit sy skuld is dat juan se pa dood is maar ek weet tog dit is nie waar nie ons kan nie vir god verantwoordelik hou vir ons eie dom besluite nie en glo my ek het hierdie rugbyweek al n hele paar gemaak dis goed om te weet ek kan jammer s daaroor
1121312 dat ons juis toegelaat word om ons eie keuses te maak ons eie foute te kan agterkom en dan dit te face wat na ons kant toe kom maar dat ons ten spyte van watter dom ding ons ookal aangevang het deur jesus se genade nog n kans kry nie en dat ons mekaar in die proses kan ondersteun nie
1121313 ek het net kom s ek gaan nie in m re se game speel nie
1121314 moet nou nie jouself simpel hou nie leon ek weet mos hoe dit is man flip ou as jy nie m re alles gaan gee wanneer jy teen ons speel nie kom skop ek persoonlik jou gat dis nou as ek speel ek hoor by wihan en rufus ek is gedrop vir m re se game venter het my nie eens self ges nie maar sy moer ek w l m re speel en ek g n m re speel selfs al moet ek die ou in my plek met n bloedbesering van die veld af kry
1121315 jip so doen my n guns en prob r my m re tackle

1121317 ek gaan by my tannie hulle in bloemfontein bly my pa hulle wil h ek moet wegkom van alles hierso af en ek stem saam hulle praat in anyway al n ruk lank van trek en oor n paar maande sal hulle ook soontoe kom
1121318 ja dis nogal snaaks maar dis half cool want hulle kom my met n helikopter haal van bloemfontein af
1121319 want dis beter so ek weet ons het nie net slegte tye gehad nie en ek wil jou graag onthou soos wat jy vanaand hier gaan uitstap dis nie dat ek vir jou kwaad is of jou wil afskryf nie dis net jy is deel van die hoofstuk wat ek m re oggend hier afsluit probeer verstaan
1121320 die plek gaan suck sonder jou weet jy dit maar as dit is wat jy moet doen is dit goed so wie weet miskien loop ons mekaar eendag tog weer raak
1121321 totsiens rozaan ek hoop ek bid regtig net die beste vir jou op die pad vorentoe
1121322 totsiens juan van vrede mag jy die man word wat jou van s jy is
1121323 hy moes hier gewees het rufus hy moes nou opgedraf het
1121324 ek weet ek weet nou sal ons net sy plek vir hom moet volstaan
1121325 is jy nie veronderstel om in die final teen ons skool te speel nie
1121326 boeta ek gee nie om wat jou coach ges het of hoe jy voel nie jy gaan speel vandag en ek gaan kyk ja ons gesin is deur n tragedie getref dis waar maar ek kan nie langer net so sit en mope nie ek het in die hospitaal al my vrede met pa gemaak en ek gaan nie toelaat dat hy selfs n sy dood nog steeds my lewe regeer nie dis my lewe en ek vat die verantwoordelikheid daarvoor al die mense wat die heeltyd hier is maak my ook mal en ek wil in anyway gaan kyk hoe tackle leon die rook uit julle uit
1121327 wel ek dink nie ek het nie en hierdie is heel waarskynlik denial of iets maar ek weet ek en jy gaan nou rugby toe kry jou goed ons moet draf die wedstryd het seker al begin
1121328 kyk na die scoreboard jy beter opgaan as julle nog wil wen
1121329 ouens onthou wat ons aan die begin van die week ges het ons w l wen ons w l hierdie week vir ons vat ons s die kampioene ons s die wenners van hierdie rugbyweek besef dit net en speel dan soos ouens wat dit weet ek is nie bereid om dit weg te gooi na al ons harde werk nie flip manne ons het deur soveel gekom hierdie week ons kan nie nou na alles hierdie beker deur ons vingers laat glip nie as ons dit doen laat ons onsself en vir juan in die steek
1121330 toemaar ek is hier wat sukkel julle so dis ewoud heymans daars nie n manier dat hulle ons gaan wen nie
1121331 ek hoop ek sien jou by die craven week proewe gee my n lui wanneer jy n kans kry
1121332 meneer daar is iets wat ek by meneer moet weet voor hierdie week verby is
1121333 ek hoekom het meneer my onder kaptein vir die rugbyweek gemaak
1121334 wat is die eerste ding wat jy gedoen het nadat die eindfluitjie geblaas het wihan
1121335 ek het gekniel om te bid en die ander ouens het gejoin
1121336 ek het geweet jy sal op n geestelike vlak die ouens baie beter kan saamsnoer as enigiemand anders sonder om dit geforseerd te maak die ouens volg jou omdat hulle soos jy wil wees wihan jonathan is n uitstekende leier maar iemand moet by hom oorneem na vanjaar ek het agtergekom dat die ouens by jou iets sien wat nie almal van hulle het nie
1121337 geloof wihan in jouself jou span jou vriende en in god dis hoekom ek jou gekies het
1121338 ek het nooit s daaroor gedink nie dankie meneer vir meneer se vertroue in my
1121339 ma en rufus se ma gaan n skoonheidsalon oopmaak nadat sy die garage verkoop het
1121340 jip ek het dit al vanoggend by haar gehoor dis seker die eerste sane ding wat sy s of doen vandat pa met sy streke begin het sy en jou ma ken mekaar blykbaar van een of ander kursus af rufus
1121341 wel dis goed sy weet nogal wat sy doen in n salon
1121342 as my o nie tricks op my trek nie het sy en leon se pa al te lekker met mekaar gekuier vanaand
1121343 imagine hulle kom saam en trou en alles dan is julle familie
1121344 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
1121345 it was good to see so many cross disciplinary teams collaborate on such challenging designs
1121346 we saw near commercial quality coding and documentation from the hundreds of hours these students and professors committed
1121347 the innovate canada finalists demonstrated a great deal of creativity and an ability to work together as teams to solve real world problems
1121348 software hardware partitioning was a common theme in these projects reflecting an increased emphasis today on co design methods
1121349 the university of toronto team picked a challenging problem that required a significant level of innovation
1121350 their design methods show a good understanding of engineering fundamentals and the resulting application appears highly extendable the analysis and presentation of their results were professional

1121353 the products we review are the ones that we know work given our experience in the particular field
1121354 federal agents may take a travelers laptop computer or other electronic device to an off site location for an unspecified period of time without any suspicion of wrongdoing as part of border search policies the department of homeland security recently disclosed also officials may share copies of the laptops contents with other agencies and private entities for language translation data decryption or other reasons according to the policies dated july 16 and issued by two dhs agencies u s customs and border protection and u s immigration and customs enforcement
1121355 the honorary sabby piscitelli mirror man which i take it means the player most likely to spend countless hours gazing at his guns in the mirror
1121356 it was a real learning experience for me working with these students and its something i want to pursue along with coaching
1121357 the person i worked with who has cerebral palsy communicates through a voice box that was a humbling experience for me i can tell learning is important to this person
1121358 we have to make a serious nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away
1121359 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to meet the challenges we face or isnt giving the american people straight talk
1121360 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1121361 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power
1121362 the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea two months ago is a slide in his poll numbers
1121363 we simply cannot pretend as senator mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem we need a much bolder and much bigger set of solutions
1121364 integration under one organization will result in greater collaboration in operational and support areas where both disciplines overlap

1121367 irans continued attempts to conduct prohibited proliferation related activity and terrorist financing
1121368 the central bank of iran and iranian commercial banks have requested that their names be removed from global transactions in order to make it more difficult for intermediary financial institutions to determine the true parties in the transaction
1121369 it is particularly concerning that the central bank of iran may be facilitating transactions for sanctioned iranian banks
1121370 the biggest mistake we made was that we tried to make agreements
1121371 everybody had his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised
1121372 we wasted precious time by cutting rope from the bottom and bringing it up
1121373 if you cant go down you have to climb up
1121374 so in such a difficult situation you are taking more risks youre climbing more technical slopes and finally you make a little mistake and youre gone
1121375 people were running down but didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem
1121376 so actually everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody were leaving each other
1121377 i didnt have time to start discussion the only thing i had to do was to go down because if you go down you have more oxygen you have more chance to survive
1121378 then this why you should take it this time plus i am only going to use it for drinks tonight if it is in my pocket you might need it down the road

1121383 i spoke to will about it and hes like yeah will waring who is our director who directed the episode and hes also a big fan of horror movies so you know we actually did a little mini horror movie for the episode whispers i pitched stuff to the guys and they really liked the idea
1121384 one of the things about tv episodic television in general is you know at the end of the day you kind of know that your heroes are going to come out of it in one piece more or less unless you happen to be carson beckett and trend a or you know what have you so i thought i was important to add this all female team for kind of two reasons one with amanda leaving i thought there was kind of a gender imbalance in the show that i kind of wanted to address by bringing in or at least introducing some potentially recurring female characters and two have the audience invest in characters that you dont really know whether theyre going to survive or not and you know it was just really a fun episode
1121385 i love doing that one of my favorite voyager episodes was called the darkling where my it was a jekyll and hyde you know episode for my character and i got to play the sort of pure evil version of my regular program so thats always a lot of fun for an actor to do and especially since i worked weeks on the sensored horror film earlier in the year i think my dark side is very close to the surface so im longing to bring it out in the pegasus galaxy

1121569 i know gossip travels fast and many people think my life is filled with drunken one night stands with sex fuelled vixens that ive gone down some universal alphabet of female names this is so far from the truth
1121570 if the girl you love is going to be your life partner someone to raise kids with to grow old with to share your vulnerabilities with that takes a lot more than lust or being good in bed the best way to keep a woman is to let her know you are hooked on her thatll keep her hooked too it means that youre serious in it for the long haul
1121571 nothing great comes easy those great at love just make it look easy
1121572 i thought maybe you could help me i dont want to lose her
1121573 im guessing your problem isnt in the bed its in the head and in that place there are no guarantees sometimes you can even lose the love of your life you find that the one that is meant to be is not meant to be after all
1121574 women dont realise that the majority of men dream of being devoted lovers happily sticking to the woman of their dreams the wandering eye all of us men are branded with loses focus when a love supreme fills the soul cavity but we are afraid because its so hard

1121579 i decided to take our friend out for a drink ill be there in five minutes b
1121580 ive suddenly had an idea do you want me to take you back to your car or do you want to come back to my place
1121581 but i didnt fall in love with her because of those qualities id forget her birthday and she didnt mind not pretend mind yknow she honestly didnt care we could discuss anything too jet li movies former relationships and family stuff character flaws and personal failings i didnt have to bite my tongue or fake anything but i didnt fall in love with her because of that either
1121582 faking it even just in the little ways most of us do most of the time takes effort and it just tires you out at the end of the day the rest of life is hard enough as it is without having to tiptoe around the person youre lying next to in bed i could tell her my weirdest dreams my darkest thoughts my very worst fears
1121583 well not amazing but classy in the old fashioned way in her career there is a lot of back biting and competition but i never saw her be disloyal sling mud or lose her dignity she understood me and knew how to handle me her libido was as high as mine and she was a great cook too
1121584 okay so im jealous so what made you know she was the one
1121585 she was making tea in my mums kitchen and we have an ant problem sometimes they run about the counters side when she saw them i expected her to scream or start to kill them or call me to do so very quietly she just watched them i asked her what she was doing and she told me she was letting them pass as i watched this gentle act something just clicked inside me from that time on i was hooked
1121586 and dont you make the same mistake make sure you tell her the moment you knew she was the one im going to give you that chance now
1121587 yes but stay by the car for the moment okay
1121588 and what did you two boys talk about all this time thats made her forgive him
1121589 i want to be like that artist who can reinvent and not be afraid of what he says and is proud of his culture and his people
1121590 it is possible to make money and a great deal of money in the stock market but it cant be done overnight or by haphazard buying and selling the big profits go to the intelligent careful and patient investor not to the reckless and overeager speculator the seasoned investor buys his stocks when they are priced low holds them for the long pull rise and takes in between dips and slumps in his stride

1121609 dont be silly its not that long a drive and youd come for me too mister
1121610 its really not our business b but obviously if he is so quick to raise a hand to a girl or to anyone for that matter he needs help if she doesnt want to go with him get her in your car and then ask her if she wants to come back to my place with you dont look at me like that b she might want company right now she is a friend and you dont have to cook that has to come before my stomach
1121611 but i want good company too to sit down with a well informed man and have a great deal of conversation over a good dinner no im still going to cook im not changing my plans
1121612 youre wrong thats not good company thats the best company

1121615 trust me take the key and go ill be right behind you
1121616 no what the fuck has this got to do with you
1121617 im only going to give you a few words of advice take it or leave it i understand you youre doing this because you dont want to lose her but trust me this is the only sure way you will lose her hitting another person even in self defence never gets you as far as hitting them with the right words never raise your hand just for the heck of it never
1121618 youre both young as long as you talk and listen to each other and give each other time you can sort out your differences
1121619 after all this time she says she wants some space
1121620 it all depends on how you play the game you can still get applause even if you lose you can still be a winner for having loved even if that love is no longer there thats the beauty of the game never let the seriousness of your ego kill the fun of it or make you feel you have to raise you hand out to strike it
1121621 i cant actually believe your line is open and youre actually carrying your phone this is a night of firsts
1121622 mums away she might need to get a hold of me so get to the point missy
1121623 yes im still alive and so is he and ill be there in a minute need anything from the shops
1121624 and were going to have company after all shes here
1121625 b im proud of you you have a heart of gold really however hard you try to hide it
1121626 yeah well i figured instead of the best company we could settle for the good kind just for tonight
1121627 ali no and not for me ive been speaking with her and i just dont think shed stay if you brought him tell him to give it some time threes company but four would be a crowd tonight
1121628 that was amazing your culinary skills are top notch missy
1121629 it was nearly spoiled because a certain someone decided to go for a drink but it wasnt bad at all even if i say so myself
1121630 well i cut the tomatoes in that cup shape and filled them with that paste do i get a mention
1121631 what do want a round of applause for using a knife and spoon
1121632 how about a slap in the mouth mr uninvited guest one more word out of you and youll be doing the dishes in fact maybe you should be doing the dishes
1121633 yeah well you better make a man out of him real soon or i know a real good place to kick him thatll make him grow up real quick
1121634 and i wouldnt smirk either youre stuck with him so maybe you should teach him some table manners or just manners period
1121635 thanks for letting us stay for dinner youre a great cook
1121636 well get up and help me clear away the dishes do some work for your supper
1121637 ive laid out everything anyway youll find it all there
1121638 actually youre a bloody dark horse but i know you too well for you to hide everything its just theres this unreachable part of you inside that gets frustrating sometimes
1121639 okay okay youre safe on that score we keep getting interrupted anyhow maybe its karma
1121640 oh o what scheme are you cooking up now lay me on the table and cut me up inside or just have me for dessert
1121641 dont give me any ideas no but turn your coffee cup over on your plate after youre finished
1121642 ah i see you want to tell my fortune missy is that it
1121643 well theres stuff and then theres stuff yknow its kind of vague
1121644 the devils in the details so lets keep him there
1121645 yeah i made them all in one go so none have any sugar in them
1121646 are you going to watch me the entire time i drink my coffee
1121647 what did you two boys talk about all that time and if i hear the word stuff one more time ill scream
1121648 i think he meant that we were talking about the opposite sex not sex sex
1121649 youve frightened him so much id be thankful hes still got the faculty of speech
1121650 well instead of dessert sex seems a good way to sweeten our after dinner coffee
1121651 but go ahead just no one ask for any physical demonstrations
1121652 the pali term vedana means a raw physical sensation the objective observation of which can provide insight into the impermanent nature of all things thats what a kiss should be like thats how a kiss should feel like it should knock out your world
1121653 how is it you can still surprise me after all this time
1121654 has my coffee cup cooled enough for you to predict some hearty doom and gloom
1121655 because its an election year the government is trying to make sure the statistics look really good
1121656 youre dealing probably with the most disengaged group or in north canterbury with young men who have got really good job opportunities and can earn really good money and they dont see the reason for staying at school
1121657 the thing that i cant understand is the double standard its against the law to have marijuana and yet schools are expected to do something other than what the law dictates
1121658 there has to be a line in the sand for things like drugs because of the safety of students
1121659 schools need to ensure that their policies are flexible and reflect the needs of the situation
1121660 it is important that student support needs are assessed on a case by case basis to ensure actions are appropriate to the circumstances and take into account the background of the student not just the incident at issue
1121661 if you go and say that those kids cannot leave school and then you dont fund alternative programmes principals like me effectively have to invent programmes and staff them and do that out of an existing budget and thats virtually impossible to do
1121662 every principal you talk to will have stories to tell you of kids who should not be at school who when they come to school cause merry hell and because they dont meet the absurdly high criteria for early leaving exemptions they cant get one
1121663 they almost invariably are behavioural issues in some cases you get a kid who just cant cope in school and therefore they get bored to tears and the behaviour starts to disrupt
1121664 theres no doubt about it that the ministry as agents of the government want to have the rates as low as possible its a good news story for them if they have lower rates
1121665 its a farce really its made a nonsense of things
1121666 in days gone by if somebody was involved in smoking marijuana at school the schools zero tolerance to that would have ended up with that kid being kicked out of school
1121667 what do you do when a student decides to assault another student and this is the third time
1121668 schools generally try lots of things we try the educative response first of all
1121669 as a foul mouth gets the same penalty as madness
1121670 it was your idea to go skinny dipping let me remind you
1121671 i dont fucking believe it no i honestly dont believe it what is going on its a damn conspiracy
1121672 why is it recently we cant have any time alone someone is always popping up and how the heck did they find us have they put a tracking device up my ass or something
1121673 but this time shes got her fianc with her too shit grab my stuff ali ive got to cover up before they make it all the way down
1121674 and be nice it could just be a coincidence and that they didnt know we were here
1121675 what did you expect honey b with all your shouting im not at all surprised
1121676 it feels exactly like that oh for some time alone
1121677 you know how slippery the sea can get when its wet
1121678 i was practising my kick for when your backside gets an itch
1121679 we always come here i didnt know youd be here
1121680 thats when we first met but we decided we were better friends than lovers
1121681 if that was so then why am i the only one not relegated to a number
1121682 she was teasing me and i her it is something we often do in company
1121683 as i said its called a private joke not for you to get
1121684 how nice to be spoken about as though youre not here
1121685 shall we leave them to it i put some beers down somewhere
1121686 i buried them in the sand over here to keep them cool well let the girls finish off the wine
1121687 theyre big girls big girls are old enough to make their own decisions
1121688 no she didnt just a little wine now and then
1121689 and did she talk about kissing other men in front of you
1121690 but if she had i wouldnt have made a big deal of it no girl is the same and no one is perfect neither are we
1121691 yeah and you can join us if you promise to behave yourselves
1121692 me misbehave what do you mean you have me mixed up with someone else
1121693 thats impossible missy youre in a class of your own
1121694 thats about as easy as me breaking out in tears
1121695 so there is a secret macho man in you after all
1121696 no he doesnt do it out of any caveman ideology he just doesnt want to disturb anyone even when he had that accident with the car i didnt see him cry once
1121697 is that when you somersaulted with the car in the air about twice your mum and dad was in the car too
1121698 his mum injured her back and took her years to recover she nearly died his dad walked away with a few bumps alis right hand was badly damaged
1121699 it looks perfectly fine now just a few sexy man scars
1121700 thats because he built up the strength in his arm again with yoga and tai chi and god knows what else you shouldve have seen it at first it was terrible black and bloated not even sure if it would be cut off at one point and his mum flown off to another country to get life saving surgery and never once did he cry never once did he complain he was getting jabbed with needles every day and i dont even remember a slight groan half the nurses fell in love with him and all missed him when he left he was the best patient theyd ever had
1121701 i remember how you would visit every day and tell me stories and stroke my hair
1121702 that was fun i was straddled on your lap trying to get a bit under your chin and just at that moment a nurse walks in the look on her face
1121703 i remember it made all the papers a few years back did they ever catch the car mechanic
1121704 that fucked up the cars electronics and caused the car to cut out i fucking made sure they did after the police realised who was to blame after ali was flown back to england to recuperate i made sure he was convicted
1121705 and you know what this crazy guy here did the minute he returns to cyprus he goes to visit the bastard in prison if we had the death penalty i would have asked for that and mister ali here goes to see how the guy is coping
1121706 what would have been the use of making myself and everyone else around me miserable we just got up and started again
1121707 he got that from his mum a very strong woman she was exactly the same from just moving one toe slightly she came back to cyprus walking on her own two feet
1121708 cant we just listen to the snore of the sea
1121709 when i was a kid i used to imagine the sea was an old man and the sound it made at night was its snore as it slept when i would come to cyprus for my summer holidays i liked to fall asleep to its sound
1121710 well i have two times i could tell you one will make me sound better than the other my most recent teary episode will have you accusing me of male pigdom again
1121711 take a large swig of the beer to numb your senses it could get sickly
1121712 no its okay man i want to hear this too
1121713 well there was one time when i was back in england after the accident and mum had the op and she was at stoke mandeville hospital recuperating from her spinal injuries they were having a sort of olympic games and one of the physiotherapists asked if my mum wanted to join despite her age and lying face down on a trolley she accepted and took part in the races watching her compete and fighting to make it to the finishing line despite all the odds and making it brought a standing ovation from the crowd and a tear to my eye i was very proud
1121714 the other more recent time is similar in a way
1121715 the euro 2008 semi final football match between germany and turkey
1121716 yeah so its a bag of wind theyre kicking about but all my mum was doing was pushing herself round a gymnasium with a trolley the heroism on that pitch the sheer heart and belief it took to fight to the very end the tragi drama is what moves us it showed that people can win even when they lose it was the stuff of dreams of drama not for nothing did msn uk choose two members of turkeys national football team for their dream team line up
1121717 you blubbered at a football match the man who didnt even cry when he could have lost his right hand
1121718 i didnt blubber i dont blubber i shed some tears
1121719 well i do remember when i first came to cyprus to go into the army i learnt the hard way that some girls fathers still carry shotguns over here
1121720 i had climbed up to a girls balcony after making friends with the guard dogs but i was discovered climbing back down and the father wasnt as friendly
1121721 well theres the most romantic thing someone has done for me though i dont know if she got the idea from somewhere else
1121722 every sms message that we had sent each other over the years we were together she had written down into a book and kept as a memento of our conversations
1121723 why dont we let the sea sleep in peace for a bit
1121724 what happens to a race in the face of discrimination
1121725 if i am president i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single overarching goal in 10 years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela to do this we will invest 150 billion over the next 10 years and leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy that harnesses american energy and creates five million new american jobs
1121726 well find safer ways to use nuclear power and store nuclear waste and well invest in the technology that will allow us to use more coal americas most abundant energy source with the goal of creating five first of a kind coal fired demonstration plants with carbon capture and sequestration
1121727 poo yall up is often referred to at our house as
1121728 you must listen to yourself to your own heart and have the courage to go your own way
1121729 weve all just got to go out and work hard
1121730 you get to learn each other personally and not just necessarily on the football field
1121731 the same thing happened this year nearly everybody being here in the offseason program and that bond just grows stronger nick harper we didnt get the whole offseason with him last year but this year we did he worked hard with us and i think all that helps
1121732 im not just a coach im a fan of football
1121733 i love to watch football and watching good players perform is a thrill for me i look forward to watching him play
1121734 were trying to instill in them youve got to go hard every play
1121735 now he knows what he has and where hes going to be
1121736 he knows its time to get in the gym 100 percent working hard
1121737 louis feels really really good hes very happy this is where he wanted to be we went through the business aspects to see what his value and level of interest around the nba might be but he wanted to stay with the sixers and they were very fair with him
1121738 it pushes heavy stuff around all day long just like joe
1121739 coming in as a rookie i wanted to have a hall of fame career
1121740 thats the goal you want to be the best of the best if you dont youre not working hard enough
1121741 we put him on their best defensive player every game and he gave up one sack as a rookie that doesnt happen a lot we expect a lot from him and hes up to it every week
1121742 it was like gosh he makes it look so easy and even if he is off balance hes able to get himself back into position hes just one of those pros who just has it and not everybody has it like he does hes one of those guys who is going to be special for a long time in this league its fun to watch him play
1121743 there wasnt a whole bunch of things last year where it was man i was terrible
1121744 i think i did some things that were ok i think my technique can get better and that has been the thing weve been working on
1121745 i was in middle school when i saw them play in the pro bowl that was a pretty cool thing for me
1121746 hes been considered one of the best players in football for a while now hes been doing it for so long and hes just so professional at everything i wanted to just watch him work
1121747 being an offensive lineman nobody notices you or knows your face or paints a forklift after you
1121748 its the kind of thing thats unique to a cleveland type town where the people really respect the guys in the trenches the blue collar guys on the line
1121749 hes been dealing with this shoulder problem for a long time
1121750 going in to repair the problem is his best chance now to open up next year feeling 100 percent
1121751 the good news is his back feels great and his left shoulder is not a problem
1121752 it seems like those two issues have been addressed going through an offseason last year and rehabbing three different surgeries at once was not easy this time hell be able to focus on just one thing
1121753 anytime you have a player of his caliber youd always love him to be in your lineup
1121754 but looking at him getting this behind him and ready to contribute on a daily basis next year is exciting
1121755 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1121756 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1121757 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1121758 i got here this morning to play and there wasnt a soul out here
1121759 it was a lot different from the last time i walked off this golf course
1121760 it was one of the most memorable weeks ive ever had certainly on that golf course
1121761 and it will be nice to go back to a golf course that i know that ive played well on and refresh and rekindle your mind with those good thoughts that certainly is a golf course ive got a lot of good memories around
1121762 i havent seen it since i played it in 04
1121763 its just an incredibly tough golf course from what i remember it requires all the shots youve got to move the ball left to right right to left you need to hit it long you need to hit it straight you need to putt well these are just some of the most difficult greens ive ever seen so it takes absolutely everything
1121764 if were going to get to the point we want get to theres no doubt our starting pitching has to do a better job
1121765 you saw it you write whatever you want report whatever you want
1121766 it wasnt like i was looking for a day off im just doing what the coaches are telling me to do
1121767 if i was hurt id be in the training room somewhere or be out working with the trainers but i feel fine i feel good
1121768 i could have gone these days had they not given me a day off i would have been out had there like everybody else
1121769 wade has done this over the years i think it really has shown not just on the practice field but even on game day that everybodys a little bit livelier
1121770 if they both want a fair competition this is a great way of resolving it i think
1121771 both sides it seems to me need to show some statesmanship some leadership
1121772 both are leading teams in the sport and i think the times come where they both need to give way if ernesto bertarelli can be persuaded to ask cnev to step down and larry and russell coutts ask ggyc to step down effectively both give up their positions then theres a good chance they can agree
1121773 its gotten out of hand we think the time has come where both sides need to figure out what is best for the americas cup
1121774 if its delayed until 2013 a lot of people will lose the will to live
1121775 tired excuses i think it would be a good idea if oracle did withdraw their appeal to get behind the guys at origin i just think its a great opportunity to get the thing back sailing under the multichallenger format rather than have a dog match between two teams who are looking for the same thing
1121776 sure we think that we should be able to find some solution
1121777 the problem is weve got to resolve the legal thing properly thats a long term effect for the cup
1121778 its one thing to solve the current situation but its not a simple quick fix it doesnt solve the interpretation of the deed
1121779 my husband was out playing frisbee with my granddaughter and they turned around and he was gone they figured he might go down to the river sometimes so it was about ten minutes and he was gonna go look for him and he came walking down the hill and moose had been shot
1121780 i dont know if that leg will ever be the same
1121781 oh hey theres bob look hes not using reusable bags
1121782 they got fresh water and we feed them twice a day
1121783 this aint right what theyre charging me with its not right it got a raw deal on all this
1121784 i feel sorry for the dogs and take them in thats a lot of it im always getting calls people wanting to know if i need dogs or want dogs i shouldve just turned them down but i didnt
1121785 yea i learned a lesson on that im not going to get to that level no
1121786 when you looked at the faces of those dogs did it break your heart that you knew that one of them died and the others were sick
1121787 if they want to be a communism state they got other states you know that you got rights in you can do what you want to do
1121788 if you find yourself drawn to the clinton candidacy you likely believe that politics is politics that partisanship isnt transmutable that republicans are for the most part irredeemable
1121789 after studying the schedule of real madrid and the dutch team i realised playing for both teams would mean too tough a physical load for me and therefore i made this choice
1121790 im taking no chances and after the enjoyable euro finals i can look back upon my decision with a good feeling
1121791 i had a comprehensive conversation with ruud and i can do nothing else but respect his decision
1121792 i regret it that i cant use his quality and experience when i compose my squad but i wish him all the best at real madrid
1121793 weve been doing this for years and this is definitely our biggest turnout so far
1121794 its great to see how something like this can unite so many people
1121795 i am not so sure hes capable of backing off
1121796 i think hes kind of got a mind set which i think is the best way to race for a championship to go after it every week we wouldnt want to have him do anything other than try to win every race
1121797 im not a happy person when im not running well
1121798 you try to look forward at things and hopefully you can say that 13 is reasonable
1121799 it was pretty cool growing up and watching him and those times when he was able to run well and get those marks and think of the unbelievable seasons that he was having watching him when i was a kid
1121800 if theres a shot for it that would be pretty cool
1121801 when the chase starts theres going to be a different race going on
1121802 theres not going to be the race of going out for wins and doing pit strategy things and stuff like that which will take your chance out of a good top 10 or a good top five you just have to be consistent and stay up there in order to get those finishes
1121803 i dont make much of it right now its something that we had to produce and put out there so we put it out there
1121804 that depth chart in your hands right now wont be the same this afternoon never mind tomorrow so its going to change every single day
1121805 the tug of war among the religious parties and the shiite tribes has emerged as one of the most significant but also least understood aspects of iraqs political scene
1121806 a true patriot is a lover of his country who rebukes and does not excuse its sins
1121807 death and carnage are not the whole story of war there is also heroism and frustration success and setback camaraderie and on occasion atrocity but death and carnage are part of the story and to launder them out of our account of the war would be a disservice
1121808 a true patriot is a lover of his country who rebukes and does not excuse its sins
1121809 i hope everybody would realize that i dont think that we can just take the week off and that gosh we got it made now everybody
1121810 that was a start its going to get tougher and tougher down the road
1121811 the quarterbacks were trying to throw on rhythm the receivers were trying to get to their spots with efficiency running hard i thought the efforts were good
1121812 i thought colt brennan was the least of the quarterbacks who got the tempo up
1121813 he would come up a little bit too slow for me i thought todd did a wonderful job pressing the tempo i thought jason was steady i want him to go even faster
1121814 it was like having a home game there was a lot of burgundy
1121815 we wanted to see if he could handle a whole game see how he would react i thought he did really well there were no shanks
1121816 i aint got on the scale i dont really get on the scale thats not my thing
1121817 just a little conditioning a little running around get my legs right
1121818 i dont think its about weight i can play heavy its just getting in shape im trying to get right get ready for sept 7 thats my main goal
1121819 thats coachs decision when he wants me back out there but i always feel like i can play
1121820 hes going to come out there and you watch hes going to make a splash when he gets going again caseys a freak the guy goes out there he can weigh whatever he weighs i dont want to throw out a weight and hes still quick as can be he still can move
1121821 its just a whole mess you want to go you want to retire they want to move on and the next thing you know he wants to come back but for what hes done for that organization he should have that right
1121822 be my guest but when the big wigs invited you as guest of honour i dont think they had that in mind
1121823 ive never understood the need to dress up and i never will
1121824 like you deserve to be here mister proud that your achievements are being honoured
1121825 you know like standing in line for something it is such a british trait not to boast but you take it too far sometimes
1121826 trying not to boast is boasting in a way yknow missy if i say i havent done anything its because i genuinely believe i havent done anything that deserves commendation not when there are so many people out there doing so much more
1121827 we managed to lose his daughter in the crowd but were going to get caught this time
1121828 you know my daughter tells me youre still single dont you ever feel you want to just marry and settle down
1121829 billions of people in the world at this moment are doing that right now sir i dont think our civilisation will collapse if i put that on hold for a little while longer
1121830 so i take it that means my girl hasnt been able to convince you to marry her yet
1121831 i also hear from my daughter that you scored the winning goal in that
1121832 you never did like wearing suits did you even when working for me weve never stopped missing you at the office
1121833 i would be glad to have you back as a partner if you wish
1121834 and ive never stopped feeling honoured every time you make the offer sir
1121835 but i think that my life is on for a change of course
1121836 what again wasnt travelling around the whole of the south of cyprus last year and documenting
1121837 well i dont aim to invent a computer with an imagination my plans are small things to do with my own desires
1121838 computer with an imagination its funny you should say that i was having a discussion about that hoax chess playing machine called the turk just now chess is one thing but computers will never match us in music or writing or dancing
1121839 well not unless someone figures out how to upload a right brained imagination
1121840 if we get to the point computers can best humans in the arts those splendid millennia old expressions of the heart and soul of human existence then why bother existing
1121841 if one is bested the struggle to be the best doesnt end but i dont think thats the actual fear we have of computers making art the fear is something else
1121842 have you ever read jorge borges short story from over half a century ago the library of babel its about a huge library filled with every story and every variation of every story
1121843 computers creating art upsets us mostly because of what it means about our humanity that we are predictable down to the last thought if a computer is able to reproduce all scenarios and predict all outcomes it would be unsettling to realise that such a machine might have the ability to tell your story for you before you even know you have a story
1121844 but we shouldnt be afraid of predictability because it is one of our most human traits as is our way of being unpredictable
1121845 so if computers do make art one day it wont unmake our existence because the making is just the pursuit not the meaning of it to do that a computer would have to become human enough to create human art it would have to find feel absorb reality to the point it is overcome to the point it sobs for release a computer perhaps could replicate every possibility but could never transfer the energy art requires to exist in the first place a computer can generate a book but will there be any soul in it
1121846 real content speaks to real people computer content may have the power to make the thing itself but to give that thing meaning will take more than just engineered imagination
1121847 just make sure you dont make us weep up there okay
1121848 honey b i doubt i could make you cry even if i rubbed onion in your eyes
1121849 ali ive said it before so ill say it again you not only amaze me with how much you know but sometimes you amaze me by how
1121850 the nfl officially reinstated veteran quarterback brett favre on monday clearing the way for his return to the green bay packers nfl commissioner roger goodells announcement ended constant media speculation on the playing status after he had retired earlier this year
1121851 im roasting marshmallows on the fire and what im burning is your attire
1121852 it is not incumbent upon cisco to own a company like vmware to broaden its presence in the data center
1121853 he was like you gotta change your name and we were just like are you kidding
1121854 i consulted a lawyer in the uk and he was like no this will be fine and itll be fine in canada
1121855 then we did a show in l a and i got called to the door with like somebodys here to see you or whatever and handsome dick had hired a private investigator from the other side of the country to come to the show and serve me with a subpoena i was like holy shit thats when i started realising as funny as this is its serious shit
1121856 it got to the point where i was like it doesnt matter that this case is ridiculous it doesnt matter that in some sense i should fight this because hes getting away with murder i just realised that if i spend all my time thinking about this and dealing with this annoying little guy thats just such a waste of my time so i was like why dont i just change my name and move on immediately upon realising that it was kind of this release like yeah it doesnt matter buddy do whatever you want out of principle it wouldve been good to be able to say no no no you cant go around bullying people with lawsuits but at the end of the day i dont want to have spent all my time arguing with some guy
1121857 saya belum tahu secara pasti kami harus menunggu dan melihat apakah saya akan di sini untuk musim berikutnya

1121859 these letters open a window onto many important aspects of 19th century british science culture and society and provide important insights into the man himself
1121860 dealing with so many letters will be a big logistical challenge
1121861 but i hope this project sparks an interest in both tyndall and the importance of his time period
1121862 didnt you just say no one really knows anyone mister
1121863 yes i did and what you dont know you arent going to get in ten questions the fun is finding out gradually
1121864 whoever it is theyve gone round to the front door
1121865 oh my darling you mean just in case its a big bad wolf at the door you mean what will you do in your towel flash it to death the building is secure my knight in a shining white towel i shall be safe to go and see who it is
1121866 wouldnt you know it i shouldve put a bloody sign up on the door
1121867 like what gestapo interrogating ali do not disturb who is it
1121868 ali went it comes to certain issues you can be so dumb it just isnt funny
1121869 i have to shes seen me damn and bloody hell
1121870 ill only be a minute but i cant promise thats how long shell stay
1121871 well the shy girl i remember has gone i see how are you
1121872 not sure last time i spoke to him he seemed sure enough about it
1121873 lets leave ali to hide his modesty do you want a glass of wine what did you want to see me about
1121874 oh i just heard ali was here and wanted to say hi
1121875 oh ive just got this kink in my neck from sitting down all day ive been devilling for b
1121876 come lie down here im going to give you a massage
1121877 never mind bs dramatics she loves to tease but no massage isnt just rubbing its the art of rubbing and as with any art there are ways and hows and every man and woman should learn how because every partner deserves the treatment
1121878 and now it looks as though youve done it put your hands where your mouth is mister
1121879 and i thought my work was over for the evening do you have any oil b
1121880 damn and here i was thinking i had stocked up my office with every convenience thats one thing i dont have
1121881 its a fix for when theres no oil at hand this can be my wedding gift to you or practice this on your husband to be on any night of the week and you cant go wrong is the front door open b
1121882 yeah should i ask why i know i know open mind
1121883 just get me the bowl of warm water please honey b youll see in a moment
1121884 hand friction done without oil should only be used to loosen up deep muscles oil makes the massage tender especially for a beginner
1121885 hand friction now why do i like the sound of that are you sure oil is going to be more fun mister
1121886 the flowers contain essential oils and the cyprus variety also has medicinal value im going to crush these in my hands and mix with the warm water to make some oil for your massage
1121887 you should be damned honoured ali hates picking flowers usually or taking any growing thing from its place
1121888 not so for a girl expecting a large bunch of roses
1121889 b youre making a big deal over nothing honey its not as if i ripped the plant out of the ground
1121890 oh buddy im just kidding go on im all ears you be all hands
1121891 did you know the jasmine is a middle eastern symbol of love used throughout time by lovers to express passion
1121892 you know in cyprus we have the tradition of weaving flower buds onto cotton threads as bracelets or necklaces young girls hung them on their wrists or necks to bloom as a sign of fertility my mum still makes them every summer
1121893 i didnt know that the fertility bit i mean my mum makes them too and hangs them around the house
1121894 i read it somewhere and if you are going to use this jasmine trick make sure you pick the flower at night the jasmines aroma is most intense at night as a flower of passion should be i guess
1121895 of course the jasmine scent just hit the back of my throat is all
1121896 yes okay im going to give you the basics to practice on your fianc step one use oil but not too much and warm your hands cold hands are a no no okay
1121897 okay second make some proper space no place were you can bounce a lot dont say a word b floor is good or blanket
1121898 right step three is ambience but nothing that distracts from the massage low candlelight slow soft music which we have already compliments of b
1121899 thank you b okay four is the massage you can do this two main ways focus on a spot like my neck for example or do a whole body massage there are three main movements compression stroking and kneading im just going to show you the basics with a back massage okay
1121900 place your hands side by side on the back palms flat and slide upwards leading with your fingers
1121901 oooh has he ever done this to you b its amazing
1121902 no she isnt it really is i cant describe it you have a gift for this
1121903 you do your touch feels very confident now im sure thats something david beckham cant do
1121904 you just reminded me of something someone else once said to me
1121905 that my touch was confident too reminded her of her grandfather
1121906 i guess apart from me she said he was the only man she ever loved
1121907 calm down girl and get your mind out of the gutter i mean he can massage you with the bottle
1121908 i showed b once to prove that anyone can massage once you have the knack down i dont believe my touch is anything special look you can even do it with this wine bottle
1121909 it can also be a self massage tool to roll under your bare feet or put in the crook of your back or between your shoulder blades and lean back against a wall and roll it around the pressure loosens up muscle tissue and encourages blood flow to the area
1121910 a glass is enough for me i want to drive home i need the car early in the morning you two can drink though ill take you home
1121911 no drinking and driving of course dont you do anything dangerous any more ali
1121912 being irresponsible when it cost the lives of others no and im in a fiery womans office massaging a crazy girl with a turkish fianc if that isnt living dangerously then what is
1121913 no the lesson is over you have enough to show your boyfriend
1121914 mommy one day i want to go to heaven to be with jesus
1121915 how can i go to heaven to be with jesus
1121916 i want to give them more reasons not to like me
1121917 hey you guys wanna go rip it up on my new 300 skate board thatll make me look more like a fagg
1121918 well my music doesnt have a message i dont necessarily have a social commentary im not trying to tell anybody to do anything you do what you want to do
1121919 i have an army who believe in what im saying that this is the truth
1121920 i would die for everyone every soldier in that army
1121921 damn if he why didnt i use that in my music ive been wanting to
1121922 well the label made me make this song or i wanted to make a song like this and they wouldnt let me
1121923 can you put out records that you want to put out
1121924 dont smoke pot dont smoke cigarettes be good be straight live a good life
1121925 craig if you wanna buck up to me you need to learn to pick your fights better because all i need to do is give you one good swipe to your bum knee and youll start thinking twice about what you did bucko
1121926 its hard to deal with the fact that there are some people whom you just cant help yet
1121927 take the world as it is not as it ought to be
1121928 i hope everybody would realize that i dont think that we can just take the week off and that gosh we got it made now everybody
1121929 that was a start its going to get tougher and tougher down the road
1121930 the quarterbacks were trying to throw on rhythm the receivers were trying to get to their spots with efficiency running hard i thought the efforts were good
1121931 i thought colt brennan was the least of the quarterbacks who got the tempo up
1121932 he would come up a little bit too slow for me i thought todd did a wonderful job pressing the tempo i thought jason was steady i want him to go even faster
1121933 it was like having a home game there was a lot of burgundy
1121934 we wanted to see if he could handle a whole game see how he would react i thought he did really well there were no shanks
1121935 because we couldnt say anything definite a lot of speculation was made as though we were seeing other people after being with someone for seven years would i do that and let me say the reason for our split isnt down to the stories in the press either were not people that would split up on what others say the press wrote bilges pressuring me into marriage separated us but that isnt true either maybe the real problem in this relationship was me i have to give my all to my work because im an artist
1121936 weve had a long loving decent relationship and i dont want its memory tarnished i want us to be remembered well plus dont upset this beautiful person when you see her with someone else dont rush to assume she is out with a new man dont upset her or youll have me to answer to
1121937 it meant that this topic after this event would no longer be a forbidden topic
1121938 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
1121939 turned a mealy mouthed bureaucratic obscure term describing the state management of labor camps that crazy little word gulag into a metaphor almost on the scale of the holocaust
1121940 and the simplest and most accessible key to our self neglected liberation lies right here personal non participation in lies
1121941 putin inherited a country that had been looted and knocked off its feet and he set about reviving it
1121942 i pay homage to the land of kolyma where many hundreds of thousands even millions of our murdered countrymen are buried the land where innocent martyrs rest has become sacred and we will honor it as sacred
1121943 once you begin watching spiders you havent time for much else
1121944 flies bugs grasshoppers choice beetles moths butterflies tasty cockroaches gnats midges daddy longlegs centipedes mosquitoes crickets anything thats careless enough to get caught in my web
1121945 and very very loving under that crusty that forbidding exterior
1121946 she can also be severe and authoritarian she knew her way around the barnyard
1121947 and shes a trapper what she does is trap flying things and eat them
1121948 the spider in the book is not prettified in any way
1121949 there are little drawings with vectors indicated of the sequence in which the spider charlotte in this case makes her web which he describes so very precisely
1121950 the coxa the trochanter the femur patella tibia metatarsus and tarsus
1121951 white got rid of the face that garth had put on charlotte and drew in two little eyes
1121952 chin up chin up put a little smile upon your face
1121953 he held out at great financial cost to himself for years and years because people wanted to fudge on that
1121954 they were worried about charlotte dying in a childrens film
1121955 children just ride the wave theyre able to go in those leaps and bounds that adults dont always do
1121956 i found myself wondering today whether my grandfather was in some way writing an appreciation of his wife
1121957 because charlotte is loyal and true and a good writer many of the words he uses to describe charlotte certainly have been true of his wife certainly they were close friends and close allies and would have done anything to have saved each others lives if they could have done it
1121958 every bug that comes along will get stuck in it and spoil the effect
1121959 it will show up better if i make the whole thing with double lines
1121960 now for the r up we go attach descend pay out line whoa attach good up you go repeat attach descend pay out line whoa girl stead now attach climb attach over to the right pay out line attach now right and down and swing that loop and around and around now in to the left attach climb repeat o k easy keep those lines together now then out and down for the leg of the r pay out line whoa attach ascend repeat good girl
1121961 i just believe in the unique status of marriage as between a man and woman and i know that we have a respectful disagreement on that issue
1121962 i would continue to support a civil union that provides all the benefits to a legally sanctioned marriage
1121963 both have this nuanced on the one hand and on the other hand need to explain position and i think that makes it difficult for either to take a stand
1121964 i would continue to support a civil union that provides all the benefits to a legally sanctioned marriage
1121965 i just believe in the unique status of marriage as between a man and woman and i know that we have a respectful disagreement on that issue
1121966 bottom line is i think that both candidates feel squeezed so the best approach is to talk about the economy
1121967 the senator so far has not been a candidate who motivates the grassroots
1121968 but these issues motivate the grassroots and will get the people in churches and people who care about these issues not only out to vote but hopefully bringing their friends along
1121969 the chicken whos next to last on the pecking order pecks the hardest
1121970 those bugs have the right to stay here theyre part of the food chain if we kill them then there will be no birds on the farm
1121971 eventually there will be only human beings on the planet and it will be a silent spring
1121972 i dont see this as moving backward im moving forward
1121973 in the past it was just a dream a hope but this year we are so much closer weve proved that weve been heading in the right direction this whole time
1121974 i believe that once you start something you should stick with it if you stumble stand up again as long as you keep the faith theres nothing that can defeat you
1121975 still lives in a rented apartment with a mattress on the floor and only two chairs and a table for furniture
1121976 mariahs just bought her and nick an amazing hideaway in the west indies for them to escape to shes also eying up another get away in monte carlo as she loves chilling out there
1121977 you have been bitten by a zombie join this application and bite back
1121978 hey i want to upload some good ol high school pictures of me and my friends
1121979 online users have a right to explicitly know when their provider is tracking their activity and collecting potentially sensitive and personal information
1121980 the committee intends to look closely at how these companies collect data on consumers internet usage and looks forward to reviewing the companies responses the committee will continue to examine the legal and privacy issues raised by these practices
1121981 i love chicago and theres no big city i spend more time in
1121982 im thrilled that our beer will be available again in this market
1121983 the wholesalers weve been able to partner with havent been involved in craft beer very long but all of them have hearts of gold i couldnt be happier to find such good people to work with
1121984 we cant turn the tap on just like that its going to be a process it will take a little bit of time
1121985 there will be games that will be enhanced by the wii motionplus as well as games that can only be played with it
1121986 users will need four if they have four controllers but were going to try to offer it for as little as possible we havent announced the price yet but the cost of making the wii motionplus is not that much so i think we can make it very affordable
1121987 most of the ideas for accessories that we had initially come up with are out now we might think up some more and we might make them if we do but we dont have any plans to release a whole lot more
1121988 the hardware team started work on the next thing as soon as they were done with their previous project but what they think up doesnt necessarily become a product
1121989 we only turn something into a product after its been thoroughly vetted inside the company were not at a point where we can give specifics but of course were working on it
1121990 what theyve done is taking a step in the right direction
1121991 will evaluate every situation individually and take actions as appropriate
1121992 i really need to put them in my top friends
1121993 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day demand met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and bottles of a hard to find organic brew black forest berry honest tea and worry about the price of arugula
1121994 the best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time
1121995 my interest is in the future because i am going to spend the rest of my life there
1121996 the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
1121997 ill habits gather by unseen degrees as brooks make rivers rivers run to seas
1121998 it is our basic right to be a happy person happy family and eventually a happy world that should be our goal
1121999 we can no longer afford to throw away even one unimportant day by not noticing the wonder of it all we have to be willing to discover and then appreciate the authentic moments of happiness available to all of us every day
1122000 always remember you are indian do things to make your people proud
1122001 addicts tend to live secret lives it is a great relief to get rid of all our secrets and to share the burden of our past
1122002 public confidence in the integrity of the surrogate courts in brooklyn and the bronx have been undermined by allegations and reports of political favoritism in the assignment of fiduciary responsibility for cases that come before the court
1122003 therefore if elected i will institute a policy as surrogate that i will bar anyone who is a member of a democratic club or anyone who holds or has held over the last two years any party position including district leader or member of the nys democratic committee from receiving any fiduciary assignments through the office of public administrator or counsel to the public administrator i have taken the liberty of sending a notice to the district leaders to let them know of my position
1122004 i did not plan to help hillary clinton with her campaign debt

1122006 no fucking shit its 6 ive been up all night

1122012 we have this but no cinnamon it just seems so odd
1122013 i was just wondering if we had the same due date
1122014 and the messenger muhammad will say o my lord verily my people deserted this quraan neither listened to it nor acted on its laws and orders
1122015 nobody sits with the quraan and leaves mutual he will either win or he will loose
1122016 and we send down from the quraan that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe in islamic monotheism and act on it and it increases the zaalimoon polytheists and wrong doers nothing but loss
1122017 the quraan is an intercessor whose intercession will be accepted and a disputant and credible adversary so whoever places it the quraan as its leader it will lead him to paradise and whoever places it behind his back it will lead him to the fire of hell
1122018 verily this quraan is either a reward for you or a burden upon you thus follow the quraan and not let the quraan follow you whoever follows the quraan it will make him to light upon the gardens of paradise and whosoever the quraan follows it will push or thrust him from behind until it casts him into the fire of hell
1122019 nobody enjoys it the quraan and benefits from it except the one who believes in it
1122020 nobody will enjoy the quraan its recitation and its understanding except the one who testifies that it is the words of allaah that he really spoke and revealed to his messenger sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam
1122021 you would need a cupboard as big as a house
1122022 if texas doesnt stop the execution texas is going to be responsible for putting the united states in breach of its international obligations
1122023 this is an individual who along with five others brutally and viciously gang raped stomped kicked slashed strangled and murdered two young teenage girls
1122024 we dont care where youre from if you commit a despicable crime like this in texas youll face the ultimate penalty under our laws
1122025 its just a last ditch effort to keep the scumbag breathing
1122026 he never should have been breathing in the first place i dont care i really dont care what anyone thinks about this except texas i love texas texas is in my blood
1122027 unfortunately i doubt that the international community is likely to brush this off as simply the actions of texas in the international community and under all u s treaty obligations the united states is responsible for texas actions

1122052 the united states word should not be so carelessly broken nor its standing in the international community so needlessly compromised
1122053 there is no dispute that if texas executes mr medellin in these circumstances texas would cause the united states irreparably to breach treaty commitments made on behalf of the united states as a whole and thereby compromise u s interests that both this court and the president have described as compelling
1122054 its very important for the citizens of texas to remember that jose medellin brutally and viciously gang raped stomped kicked slashed strangled and murdered two teenage girls in houston
1122055 the world court has no jurisdiction here in texas were concerned about following texas law and thats what were doing
1122056 if the world sees us ignoring the rights of foreign nationals arrested here there is very little reason for them to recognize the rights of u s citizens
1122057 this is the type of allegation you would expect to hear under a liberal government
1122058 nadat ik de programmas van real madrid en het nederlands elftal nog eens goed had bestudeerd kwam het besef dat ik gezien de vereiste fysieke inspanning om op dit niveau maximaal te presteren een keuze moest maken
1122059 de combinatie van enerzijds de competitie beker en champions leaguewedstrijden van real madrid en het programma van het nederlands elftal anderzijds is voor mij een te zware belasting er rest mij dan ook geen andere keuze
1122060 uiteraard ga je bij dit soort beslissingen niet over n nacht ijs ik heb met oranje een heel fijn ek achter de rug en kijk daar met een goed gevoel op terug
1122061 ik heb uitvoerig met ruud gesproken en ik wil en kan niet anders dan zijn besluit respecteren natuurlijk vind ik het spijtig dat ik bij het samenstellen van de oranjeselectie geen beroep kan doen op zijn kwaliteiten en internationale ervaring
1122062 when august arrives fans in big ten country start thinking about football big ten fans will love getting an inside look at how their teams are getting ready for the upcoming year

1122277 football is a great way to connect with people so we can then tell them about other things we have going on
1122278 i talked to the guys last night and told them from here on out its just football 24 7
1122279 one day in a very bad mood mom told me to get rid of the cars in the driveway right away
1122280 if someone says im dealing with a death were going to be reasonable and give them a 30 day extension
1122281 but 1 475 thats a lot of months mourning not to be insensitive
1122282 if youre telling me we had a mentally anguished individual and that inspectors made no attempts to get at that that can be considered
1122283 there will have to be some serious evidence but if we were deaf to that point i would be willing to reconsider some of those fees

1122288 jones was said to be a student of the indian and filipino races and a friend to all indigenous peoples despite the conditions surrounding his premature death
1122289 a dispute over transportation jones was apparently promised a number of boats but despite his efforts the balsas came in late and in insufficient numbers which wore his patients thin an angry jones yelled and screamed at the ilongots for not going through with their agreement one day william exploded with rage and he did the unthinkable he grabbed the arm of takadan the respected elder and threatened to detain him until the promised balsas arrived soon after he was visited by 3 native men palidat magueng and gacad who approached him in a friendly matter about the balsas without warning palidat struck jones over his left eye with a bolo magueng pierced his right arm with a spear and gacad speared him in the abdomen romano jones assistant fended off one of palidats bolo blows and jones pulled out his revolver and fired some shots scaring off the assassins jones was thankful and as a token of his appreciation he gave romano his wristwatch and gave instructions for the preservation of his notes and specimens jones took medicine for his wounds and he even bandaged the hand of romano despite the effort he died four hours later
1122290 born of mixed parentage more white than indian as jones was heard to say while a student at hampton university
1122291 since the foul weather set in october 10 1908 this house has been a general gathering place for the greater part of tamsi
1122292 in terms of biography while william joness stellar success in educational achievement was touted as an affirmation of the u s s federal indian educational policy his failure to distinguish between his highly judgmental moral views of his ilongot hosts and that of purely scientific observation as an ethnologist reveal character flaws in the scientist that eventually cost him his life
1122293 did americans use the anthropological data gathered by dr jones to complete the conquest of the ilongot people
1122294 but if any of you lacks wisdom he should ask god who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly and he will be given it but he should ask in faith not doubting for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed about by the wind for that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the lord since he is a man of two minds unstable in all his ways

1122299 the person who actually presses the button to make the recording supplies the necessary element of volition not the person who manufactures maintains or if distinct from the operator owns the machine
1122300 cablevision more closely resembles a store proprietor who charges customers to use a photocopier on his premises and it seems incorrect to say without more that such a proprietor makes any copies when his machines are actually operated by his customers
1122301 the barren woman is my poor friar who is not appointed to bring forth children in the church but at the last judgment he will bring forth many because then the judge will set down to his glory all those whom he is now converting to christ by his secret prayers the fruitful mother is left to languish ibid means that the vain and loquacious preacher who now prides himself on those whom he imagines he has begotten by his own powers will see then that he had nothing to do with their salvation
1122302 we apologize for the knee jerk reaction and have issued a retraction order the affected stores are being directed to put the magazines back on sale
1122303 the parody of our newspaper ad in the august mad was very clever most of us at circuit city share a rich sense of humor and irony but there are occasional temporary lapses

1122305 any of our other 600 stores directly across the street from 600 other best buys
1122306 which incidentally was featured in last weeks flyer for four hundred bucks more pity the suckers who bought it then
1122307 as a gesture of our apology and deep respect for the folks at mad magazine we are creating a cross departmental task force to study the importance of humor in the corporate workplace and expect the resulting powerpoint presentation to top out at least 300 pages chock full of charts graphs and company action plans
1122308 we at mad were shocked and confused by this entire incident mainly because we had no idea that circuit city even sells magazines nonetheless we accept their apology but hold out hope that their gesture of a 20 gift card is only an opening offer

1122326 have called into question whether dft testing at the time of implantation is still required yet physicians have been reluctant to abandon it despite mounting evidence that it may no longer be necessary
1122327 proof of concept has now been established that routine dft testing is unlikely to provide sufficient information that impacts icd programming in the overwhelming majority of patients and it carries some slight risk
1122328 but when we look carefully at the data we dont really see that it provides any particular benefit
1122329 as we get better at device implantation we have to think about whether putting the patient under further risk is really worth it we know that there is a chance of sudden death after dft testing although its low in the range of 0 1 or less
1122330 future studies are needed to really tease this out and to see whether or not dft testing is beneficial or possibly harmful
1122331 by moderately extending the detection duration using fast rate cutoffs atp in faster rate zones and existing supraventricular tachycardia discrimination algorithms the prepare study programming can safely be used to reduce the combined morbidity of spontaneous shocked episodes arrhythmic syncope and untreated sustained symptomatic vt vf events in primary prevention patients
1122332 arguably its one of the best executing food companies in our coverage and when you look at the benefits of snacking and the trading up and you look at commodity costs and concerns this is a company thats been able to offset through cost programs through productivity through pricing a lot of that risk and its continuing to hit its numbers

1122336 acte has been providing case study examples and guidelines to implement demand management for travel spend optimization over the last decade

1122338 the animal has been using up a lot of energy developing its genitalia and using a lot less to defend itself
1122339 consumers are already shell shocked by higher prices but their wallets are going to be hit harder than ever before on their next vacation or business trip
1122340 with rising airfares ive had to take a completely different approach to my leisure travel
1122341 theres a lot more time invested in researching better fares looking at alternate airports and determining any potential savings from driving to an airport that may not necessarily be closest to home
1122342 has initiated or participated in over 30 domestic fare and surcharge increases
1122343 while travelers are no doubt feeling pinched especially in light of rising food and gasoline prices it is difficult to blame airlines for raising prices in order to cover costs that are by and large beyond their control
1122344 we have had cheap flights and now it is time to pay the bill
1122345 theyre starting to look at destinations like buenos aires where you can have a relatively european experience and the dollar goes further

1122360 we are putting in place an unprecedented action plan to tackle the issues raised
1122361 audience research suggests the comprehensive action we have taken is rebuilding the trust of viewers and listeners
1122362 at nbc you have this giant corporate vertically integrated company the digital division had seven people and three weeks later there were 67
1122363 what happened was 67 people all wanted to feel they are controlling this you throw a bit of sponsorship and product placement into the mix and you have a recipe for all kinds of problems
1122364 the psychological neoteny effect of formal education is an accidental by product the main role of education is to increase general abstract intelligence and prepare for economic activity
1122365 but formal education requires a child like stance of receptivity to new learning and cognitive flexibility
1122366 it probably to an extent counteracts the attainment of psychological maturity which would otherwise occur at about this age
1122367 by contrast many modern adults fail to attain this maturity and such failure is common and indeed characteristic of highly educated and on the whole effective and socially valuable people

1122379 my favourite story is him taking the sailors out of the pub and making sure they got back to their ship on time
1122380 from what i have read he physically pushed the sailors out of the pubs there are stories of him nudging them along the road and anyone who tried to escape was herded into the crew again until they got back to the thorrod
1122381 its better than a lassie film in many ways its an extraordinary story the average dog in my experience has a loyalty for his master and the family he lives with but bamse was a dog that appeared to have a loyalty for a wider family
1122382 he had a sphere of concern for those people that he loved and he looked after them very well
1122383 i was in a fortunate position being a gp in this town that many of my patients remembered the dog and were very keen to talk to me about it
1122384 i started scribbling their stories furiously but then research took me to norway to canada south africa and other people who had something to say and i was compelled to write this down and it became apparent that there was a story just bursting to be told and a book had to be written
1122385 men aged over 65 commit suicide at a rate three times that of other adults and account for 20 percent of overall suicides

1122421 israel decided to take the humanitarian decision to transfer to jericho 87 residents of the shujaiya neighbourhood in gaza because of the violence carried out by hamas
1122422 we talked with them on the bus and we told them that jericho and the west bank are different from the gaza strip and that the israeli army controls this region they have to respect the law
1122423 are mainly young people aged between 14 and 20 years who will remain in jericho indefinitely their families will not be allowed to join them
1122424 received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
1122425 we never wanted anyone to leave in this regrettable way
1122426 this is a path that does harm to them because by the mere act of fleeing a person places himself in the realm of suspicion
1122427 we condemn the criminal acts undertaken by the hamas leadership against the palestinian people in shujaiya in gaza
1122428 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite

1122437 but then i thought they know what they are doing
1122438 there was some disruption and the street was blocked for some time

1122440 the phillies were a team said to excite ramirez they have a great lineup and an even better ballpark for him to put up big second half numbers and enhance his free agent value the phillies had interest but were apparently offering even less than l a they may have had concerns about how ramirez would fit into the same outfield with pat burrell

1122455 to whom can i expose the urgency of my own passion there is nobody here among these grey arches and moaning pigeons and cheerful games and tradition and emulation all so skilfully organised to prevent feeling alone
1122456 to whom can i expose the urgency of my own passion
1122457 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
1122458 pop music today tends to be too focused on the production being hip and with it but what really counts at the end of the day is the quality of the songwriting if you want to have a lasting quality to do what you do and you want to get up onstage ten years later and not have people say thats terribly dated get off the stage you have to focus on the songwriting bwo is very much about the joy of good pop songwriting
1122459 ive absolutely no idea someone asked me the other day if they thought we could crack the market thats the sort of expression i expect to hear from a cynical a amp r man at a major label i dont expect that to come out the mouth of a fan or a journalist im not cynical about making music and the fans arent cynical about our music these days its interesting because you can have a really good niche following in lots of countries if you use the internet wisely and you dont have to worry about being top ten this week or top ten next week
1122460 i think what they like is that were not manufactured weve had too many idol winners and too many boybands and too many girl bands i hate manufactured music i like music thats organic and real with bwo its obvious were real because a major record company would never put together a group featuring a 47 year old man a 43 year old woman and a 26 year old guy who looks like hes brought mum and dad on stage with him
1122461 youre confessing on the dance floor you betray your heart when looking my way
1122462 of course it was i did a track for alcazar called crying at the discotheque and madonna mentioned once in an interview that she loved it so much she wanted to make her own crying at the discotheque thats how she came up with hung up i thought if madonnas stealing from me i might as well be inspired by her and name check one of her songs lay your love on me has nothing to do with hung up as a song but obviously when you listen to the production there are similarities it has that same filter disco feel
1122463 they sent us these really crappy songs written by second rate british songwriters and we said why would we do this it would be suicide to perform this crappy song
1122464 i love eurovision i call it the gay soccer tournament what you need to do is get rid of the rule that the uk entry has to be written by uk songwriters if you allow foreign songwriters to submit entries youll have much much better songs competing andy abraham placed last this year because he had an awful awful song the reason he got to be the uks entry is because the other songs were even worse
1122465 if you put in more of an effort you can win it if you put in a good song with a good performer you have a chance you cant put in a second rate artist like andy abraham singing a really crappy song and expect people to vote for it come on that song was so so awful
1122466 to defend something is always to discredit it yes the person who defends that has never believed in it if he does believe then the enthusiasm of faith is not a defence no it is the assault and the victory a believer is a victor
1122467 thou shalt not extinguish thine anger but shall master it that thy conscience may not be blunted by adjustment to wrong causes
1122468 its better than my expectations the timing removes another overhang the longer you have a lack of leadership that weighs on morale and your ability to retain talent and recruit new talent sooner was better than later and the person they got was a great candidate it has to be viewed as a positive announcement

1122470 i think some people are just going to talk about how foolish the ordinance is and i think some people will want to have like a symbolic showing of how foolish it is
1122471 why do we think they are best matched on learning according to their date of manufacture
1122472 were trying to teach them things about themselves through working with the dogs

1122488 no somos favoritos as que cualquier cosa que podamos lograr ante el deportivo ser buena pero con un poco de suerte podemos pasar a la siguiente ronda
1122489 no tanto como para que no podamos tener oportunidades ante ellos
1122490 est claro que pod amos haber tenido un rival m s f cil pero no estoy decepcionado con el sorteo adem s conozco bien el f tbol espa ol
1122491 nuestras mayores ventajas son que la liga espa ola no comienza hasta el 31 de agosto y que jugamos el primer partido fuera porque en la vuelta delante de tantos aficionados no podemos jugar mal adem s ellos no saben mucho sobre nosotros as que podemos sorprenderles

1122558 he told her he was going to la to work and see his kids but the reality is he is desperately trying to get back with his wife he realizes hes made a terrible mistake he is trying to keep sienna at arms length and hasnt told her it is over yet so she is going frantic
1122559 the reason the whole sienna fling happened was because he fell off the wagon he stopped ringing his counselor and stopped going to meetings him not being sober is the key to the whole mess as soon as balthy arrived back in la he started pleading with his wife to take him back he told me hed gone to their house and stood outside crying he was on the phone to rosetta on and off for two hours crying and constantly calling in his mind he has definitely dropped sienna

1122580 it always is a big challenge to make sure the post olympic legacy will be used
1122581 i do think there are some opportunities that havent been used and i dont know if and when they will be
1122582 i would like to see it as an olympic park where people would use it
1122583 we in athens dont have a large park or one like chicagos millennium park
1122584 hope and pray the necessary actions will be taken to make the most out of these venues
1122585 other venues have remained in the ownership of the state and have not been properly maintained or utilized

1122599 those ads really were focused on two things they were focused on the fact that sen obama wants to raise taxes and im opposed of it and he opposes an energy policy which would work including offshore drilling so the message there is therere stark differences between myself and sen obama
1122600 this is surprising since an earlier tega measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
1122601 we are committed to following a rigorous scientific process while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results

1122609 for months ive called for a reduction of tensions through increased diplomacy with iran to lower oil prices and ensure compliance with the nuclear non proliferation treaty
1122610 i welcome the recent policy shifts by this administration including the sending of undersecretary of state william burns to geneva and the announcement of establishing a us interest section in tehran
1122611 i am pleased to see that my opponents have recently joined me in opposing the bush administrations approach to iran i have repeatedly called for the need of this administration to resolve these issues through diplomatic means it is no coincidence that after this administration announced new diplomatic measures oil prices went down by nearly 30 per barrel this drop in oil prices underscores the benefits of increasing diplomatic contacts with iran the bush administration must exhaust all diplomatic options with iran before imposing further sanctions
1122612 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1122613 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button
1122614 you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1122615 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
1122616 when i envision the future of robots i always think of the jetsons
1122617 george jetson never sat down at a computer to task rosie to clean the house
1122618 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us
1122619 but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention
1122620 when i stood there and looked at that packbot i realized that if that robot hadnt been there it would have been some kid
1122621 the screening and mobile units were developed as part of amtraks working hand in hand with domestic and international counter terrorism agencies and experts to continually fortify amtraks safety and security practices

1122628 you cannot let an incident elevate in that environment flight attendants are asked to contain and calm situations as quickly as they can but at 30 000 feet we dont have the opportunity to just ask someone to leave
1122629 i think they were just discriminating against us because we were young decent looking girls i mean nobody else on the plane looked like us except us
1122630 excuse me my seatmates are enjoying their drinks but you seem to have missed me
1122631 i am very angry that there are people going through here that ive been friends with for years
1122632 when i see them out on the street i really dont know how im going to react to them
1122633 i do not know how to draw what you are asking for so i will keep showing you robots that fall within my comfort zone
1122634 i think the rockets along with the lakers and the celtics have the best talent in the league
1122635 they were working on a segment about female midlife crisis
1122636 personal stories of women who have done drastic things to change their lives
1122637 you arent really advising women to go through a midlife crisis are you like we all have a choice
1122638 expressive visual or physical conduct of a sexual or gender motivated nature
1122639 has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individuals work educational purpose or status
1122640 where free speech is of critical importance because it is the lifeblood of academic freedom
1122641 the precedents of the court leave no room for the view that because of the acknowledged need for order first amendment protections should apply with less force on college campuses than in the community at large
1122642 only if no reasonable limiting construction is available that would render the policy constitutional
1122643 speech cannot be prohibited in the absence of a tenable threat of disruption
1122644 t he policys use of hostile offensive and gender motivated is on its face sufficiently broad and subjective that they could conceivably be applied to cover any speech of a gender motivated nature the content of which offends someone this could include core political and religious speech such as gender politics and sexual morality
1122645 thats sort of half reading foucault and baudrillard and half making stuff
1122646 yo um it would be mad fly if you could like touch my dick
1122647 so when are you going to kiss fuck lick my c
1122648 omg youre so cool and funny youre not like other girls
1122649 why are men so intimidated by me is it because i play an instrument
1122650 if every garage mechanic and driver knew the details and was involved in the planning of the attack it never would have happened
1122651 you must decide the weight and significance if any such statements deserve
1122652 we knew we shouldnt expect to see something like that
1122653 the really cool thing is that all the details are still there
1122654 the existence of wet based glaciers proglacial lakes tundra vegetation and insect remains all indicate that the climate of the western olympus range was warmer and wetter that that of today
1122655 as it cools it crosses thresholds this is one when antarctica became permanently frozen and locked up
1122656 because if human beings are unfortunate enough to push climate over one of these thresholds it could be a total catastrophe
1122657 theres a lot of incentives now loans and things that really benefit a first time home buyer its a buyers market
1122658 and they probably need to take a look at their price and their condition if there are things to improve the property may need to do those things
1122659 we also did google earth so we could see the area on actual pictures
1122660 we knew we might get less for the house we were selling but knew wed get a good deal on a house right now
1122661 no princ pio o movimento das ondas acontecia aos meus olhos como uma parvo ce
1122662 the purpose is to draw attention to the fact that the speaker of the house adjourned for a five week vacation without addressing the most important issue facing america today
1122663 i understand fully well that its only part of the solution
1122664 the democrats who are saying you cant drill your way out of this correct if all youre doing is drilling what i would say is you cant get out of the energy crisis without drilling
1122665 no amount of showboating on the house floor will change that or convince people hes going to bring something different to the table
1122666 to imply that im in the pocket of any organization is certainly insulting and wrong my guess is sarvi has raised money from all sorts of groups am i to assume that everybody who has contributed to him has somehow bought him no
1122667 i have voted for bills i have pushed legislation to drill not only in the outer continental shelf but in anwr
1122668 youve got declining home prices very tight credit conditions a soft jobs market and a weak stock market the consumer has got a lot to deal with
1122669 i love myself i think actually a little bit too much i have a gorgeous girlfriend because image is everything in real estate
1122670 he has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but he is in good spirits
1122671 he is going to have surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to correct the damage he says hell be okay and is looking forward to a full recovery
1122672 whether or not they can defend it remains to be seen and im skeptical about that but the bottom line is dell will probably get this trademark
1122673 as soon as a trademark is registered another company can make a move to cancel
1122674 there is a period of time where a competitor can enter a sort of litigation to cancel its like an opposition but procedurally different
1122675 if youre selling apples you cant trademark the phrase apple because competitors have a right to use it
1122676 but if your company is named apple and you sell computers youll have a very strong trademark
1122677 you cant steal a generic term from the lexicon and make it your own
1122678 you dont have an unlimited amount of time to start using a trademark
1122679 after notice of allowance you have three years to use it if you dont use it the trademark is abandoned
1122680 if its a generic thing no one will recognize the trademark
1122681 the reason for intellectual property law is to assert it against other people as a sword there is not much value in sitting back on a trademark and not enforcing them
1122682 but in this case id prefer to be council for the defense
1122683 we had a lot of people from government agencies saying theyd love to know more about the security engineers at apple because its such an opaque company
1122684 i found that when i reported a bug apples security team could not even really talk to me because the conversation was not approved
1122685 they were also not able to give me realistic dates on when patches would come out for similar reasons
1122686 we had a lot of people from government agencies saying theyd love to know more about the security engineers at apple because its such an opaque company
1122687 i found that when i reported a bug apples security team could not even really talk to me because the conversation was not approved

1122691 barack and i as partners as friends and as lovers we accessorize each other in many ways

1122739 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets
1122740 now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million dollars in contributions because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers mccain wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1122741 boy thats really sad i didnt know that barack obama had stooped to dishonesty corporations are not allowed to give contributions to candidates and employees of oil companies give to barack obama as well as to john mccain so its simply dishonest as well as below the belt
1122742 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1122743 its unfortunate that senator obama is using false advertising to explain why he can be trusted to do something about energy prices senator obama says he doesnt take campaign contributions from oil companies but the reality is that exxonmobil shell and others are among his donors i wonder if theyll fix the ad
1122744 im barack obama and i dont take money from oil companies or lobbyists and i wont let them block change anymore
1122745 obama says he doesnt take money from oil companies we say thats a little too slick

1122762 although downside risks to growth remain they appear to have diminished somewhat and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased
1122763 the current dollar decline reflects an adjustment in traders expectations towards u s interest rates after the fed policy statement added a phrase describing the downside risks to growth while making a clear upgrade in its inflation alert
1122764 despite the feds explicit recognition of higher inflation in the statement we consider this language largely a rhetorical shift aimed at managing interest rate and currency market expectations rather than setting up for an actual rate hike
1122765 the fed decision was just as expected so the market reaction was to sell the dollar especially against the euro
1122766 but even with the pressure on the dollar the yen didnt get much lift because of the expected interest rate differentials which drove the yen to a new low
1122767 these are the strongest words we have heard from the ecb until now and increase the risk that one small rate hike in july wont be sufficient to bring inflation back below the 2 level although trichet repeated that the ecb did not envisage a series of rate increases

1122792 we felt we got lucky eberle was a kid that when he left our draft meetings we sort of kept our fingers crossed that wed be able to get him we were lucky to get him we got players that we had a lot of interest in which is always good
1122793 we have a lot of skilled players on the team but not a lot of pure goal scorers
1122794 he sort of fits that bill we think down the road hes going to be a very good player for us
1122795 riley has a lot of potential to do a lot of things
1122796 i think at the end of this year well give some serious thought and seeing whether he wants to turn pro or not
1122797 he played in every situation hes been training really hard since the end of the season he knew his strength had to get better hes going to get every opportunity to make the team in september
1122798 we needed to get him some playing time and we went into stockton and made the all star team
1122799 we brought him to springfield for the end of the year and he played really well at our recent prospect camp he looked great his biggest strength is he does all the little things well
1122800 over the course of 80 games he was probably our best player and sort of came out of nowhere from that standpoint hes going to get a good opportunity to maybe win a job up here with the big team
1122801 he had a great year and had gotten better each year
1122802 at our recent prospect camp he was one of our top forwards when we drafted him he was 170 pounds and now hes 215 pounds hes going to play a big part at north dakota this year hell be one of their top line players were very high on him
1122803 it was like nothing could go right for the kid but he came back at the end of the year and played very well weve kept a close eye on him this summer and hes training very hard theres no after effects from his injury he knows as well as we do that this is a big year for him hes got a lot of making up to do this year he understands more so than anybody else what he has to do this year were expecting a good year out of him
1122804 he has that pro mentality he skates so well and does everything almost effortlessly we think it was time for him to come out of school and hell probably need a little time at springfield to adjust to the pro game but i dont think its going to be long before hes in the nhl
1122805 hes another one were going to keep a close eye on this year
1122806 hes got to get a little bit bigger but at our recent camp he was up around 190 pounds for a kid to step into michigan state and play on their first power play and first penalty kill is a tribute to the type of player this kids going to be
1122807 hes an old school type of defenseman in that hes a stay at home player
1122808 he doesnt carry the puck a whole lot but he moves it quickly defensively hes more than adequate hes very strong for his age
1122809 we expect him to play at least 60 games down there when he did play last year he played very well for us at 6 5 and 200 pounds that covers a lot of room hes got a great attitude and he knows what he has to do we fully expect hes going to do it
1122810 hes signed and hell be the no 1 goalie in stockton this year hes very athletic we signed him because of his athleticism hes just so quick and has all the basic ingredients to be a good goalie its just a point of getting the fundamentals down and him having confidence in his own game

1122834 i discovered these items a couple of moths ago when i noticed a boy with a monkey backpack and his mum was holding the tale it made me laugh so much tokidoki character backpacks would be so cool my little boy adores all the characters especially leche i could definitely see these on the shop shelves how cute
1122835 okay im totally serious when i say this but i think a really rocking tokidoki accessory would be one of those little kids backpack leashes
1122836 a huge umbrella with the outside painted pure black but the inside covered in designs from tokidoki like every inch covered in art work the handle should also be covered in designs also the umbrella should have changable tops and handles so that you could buy just the umbrella tops or handles and change them when u need a change to suit ur mood this could be sold around the world because it rains everywhere and u should have optional attachments like u could hang little plastic figurines off the ends of the umbrella wires or have a radio with a headphone plug in option in the shaft and the handle could be shaped to resemble a hand so it looks like ur holding hands with someone gt also u could have a little mirror that pops out or a secret compartment or something even as crazy as an ipod dock there could be a little plastic screen the slides to the side to protect it from the rain and that way u could watch ur ipod and charge it and a pez dispenser or a little snack stash going on lol anyways thats my idea
1122837 i havent read all of these but the 2 things i would love the most 1 a tokidoki smart car fuel efficient and really cool the best part about smart cars are the colored panels can be removed so they could do different series in different colors and you could collect them all because you can just change out the panels then do like a simple interior and have it come with cool car accessories containers for the trunk and cd holders and cup holder etc 2 tokidoki camera maybe with nikon because i love their quality and then have a fun party feature where you can have tokidoki borders added to your photos for printing like on those photo sticker booths that were so popular and maybe have those sticker sheets come with the camera because that would be really cute and fun

1122852 that ensures we will have more than sufficient funding on hand to continue launching falcon 1 and develop falcon 9 and dragon

1122868 renewable chemicals corp a subsidiary of industrial biotechnology will use the alchemx production platforms to convert sugarcane based ethanol to ethylene the bio ethylene can then be converted into various downstream chemicals including ethylene oxide low density and high density polyethylene styrene and polystyrene existing manufacturing infrastructure can be utilized that now produce these same chemicals from petroleum based ethylene

1122870 im inspired by sundances nimrod nation i loved the way it showed its subject in a respectful and objective way and let the audience decide how to feel about it
1122871 weve really set out to do a wide variety of genres but all shows with really great characters
1122872 those are the types of stories were attracted to and then we wrap them in the packaging thats right for them whether its a hosted format a docusoap or an elimination competition
1122873 i think at the end of the day what theyve told me is theyre very appreciative of it because it really made them come to grips with the level of where theyre getting ready to step to and the gravity of the situation
1122874 gabe and melissa without a doubt are vocally head and shoulders above shawn mayer just as straight ahead singers theyre head and shoulders above her and i also think their stories are really really compelling
1122875 i personally believe its between gabe and melissa at this point i would be happy to produce either one of them if shawn sneaks up and takes it away from them i think theres massive potential with her as well but if youre asking me as a betting man i think its gabe and melissa and i think its a horse race i think its too close to call
1122876 to have somebody up there who is a mother of five and battling her weight issue and actually winning and succeeding at that and then with just this gift of vocal ability that she has you just dont see that everyday
1122877 when the things over if she doesnt win it and she wants to work with me ill be sitting on go
1122878 came in and he looked like he just gotten off of work
1122879 i think throughout the show youve watched him go from this really shy introverted guy on stage to his last couple performances really engaging the audience his confidence level is going up
1122880 you can feel a different presence around him now on and off the stage
1122881 i think hes got a great shot at winning the show
1122882 if he doesnt win the show i think there will be people lining up in nashville to sign this guy to a record deal
1122883 came in and just had a scowl on her face
1122884 i think shes gone through a lot of personal changes i dont think on an artistic level shes gone from terrible to great i think shes pretty much remained consistent on the level of talent shes given us
1122885 but on the personal side she feels like a completely different person shes smiling and she really feels like shes bringing something to the table
1122886 that was a very gutsy call on her part and probably the right call to make
1122887 its like i explained to her just because somebody like myself has a reputation of writing hit songs and producing hit records and you have a lot of success and momentum does not mean that you work well with everyone a lot of the creative process in music comes down to chemistry between people if she felt like our chemistry was off and it wasnt giving her what she needed thats really the way it goes down in the real world
1122888 i think thats what helped her in the end having someone with more patience that would be easier with her and the mentoring process
1122889 i would not have bet on that at the beginning of the show i was shocked that she
1122890 whoever wins this show its not going to be an easy ride theyve still got to go make great records theyve got to visit those radio stations theyve got to do the meet and greets theyve got to spend those 20 hour days on the road
1122891 i think our final 3 i think they do have the fortitude to do what it takes to become a bonafide nashville star
1122892 you need to have something lined up you need to be showcasing in nashville within 20 days of the show being over because people in nashville are interested
1122893 they hadnt even thought of that i said dont let the heat of what you have going on here escape you take advantage of it i think any one of these three finalists whether they win the show or not could have a record deal before the end of 2008 if they play their cards right
1122894 i know at the end of the day the country audience is going to pick someone whos great someone that is the real deal i think no matter who wins out of the final 3 i can make a great record
1122895 country music fans across america its a cultural type thing its not just a song or a radio station its a culture
1122896 i think people that havent grown up around that culture dont necessarily understand what artists have a shot at really connecting with our audience i think one misstep in this process was not having real nashville country music cultural people involved in the talent picking process more heavily i think that was a misstep
1122897 artists that should have never been on there and did not represent the best of what nashville has to offer and would never have a chance with connecting with our audience
1122898 the country fans that have voted throughout this show have voted it down to the final 3 and in my opinion all of the final 3 would have a shot in the real world
1122899 thats never been my goal ever i make country music i write country songs i produce records and i tour thats my life
1122900 tv for me is a way for me to hopefully have a positive impact on the music i love and broaden our base and broaden the spectrum of country music
1122901 i think across the board i just have more experience than he does
1122902 when i say something to an artist from an artist to another artist i believe it carries more weight and its more realistic in what theyre really going to be dealing with

1122990 place inspirational quote by incredibly successful iconoclastic innovator here which i will briefly consider as a call to action in my own pathetic life before returning to the important work of devising follow up scenarios for the cakefarts phenomenon
1122991 some people will agree and some people wont agree some will think the cost too great however my general feeling is that we need to proceed with the project because other countries out there in the marketplace are and we dont want to be left behind
1122992 its important for us to have a world recognised animal lifetime identification and tracing system in place
1122993 there are always little issues that will pop up we dont live in a perfect world but we have a really good team of people working for us and we will be able to work out any hitches
1122994 in 2009 people will be able to use the tagging technology to record animal movements but it wont be mandatory until 2011

1122997 i had looked at all the bulls up for sale and as far as i was concerned 06 354 was the best bull there
1122998 that confirmed to me that i had just bought the best bull in the country and paying 31 000 for him was to be expected
1122999 theres an old saying that you cant make a ladys purse out of a sows ear so if you want to produce quality stock you have to pay for it
1123000 we always carried a few cows anyway so we decided it wasnt too much more expensive or work to operate a cattle stud
1123001 about six years ago we decided to lift the genetics of our herd by buying a better quality service bull and the lift in our herd is there for all to see
1123002 he is tremendously wide has a lovely depth a nice set of figures to him and he is a bull that is starting to come on
1123003 weve got heaps of feed left and we should have enough on hand to see us through until the end of october
1123004 this season we had 1030 bales of baleage and 200 bales of hay we also have two self feeding stacks of silage that havent been touched yet the entire supplement has been made on the farm
1123005 its been pretty much mud free until the last couple of weeks i hope the weather continues to be good to us
1123006 were off to a really good start to the new season ahead
1123007 we have plenty of grass the cows are in good condition talk over the payout is good for the coming season and we have plenty of feed for spring which is excellent its shaping up to be a good season
1123008 my only worry is what the cost of fertiliser is going to be and also other farm related expenses are on the way up
1123009 the summer crops saved our bacon last season without them we would have been in trouble they were a god send
1123010 people ask if we spray garlic in the air the smell is so strong
1123011 garlic is good for you and should be part of a healthy lifestyle
1123012 the fries portion of garlic fries might negate any healthy benefits
1123013 the garlic is helping me enjoy healthy vegetables that would have been less tasty on their own

1123019 unfortunately previous legislatures have not taken the action to reform the budget and i think thats one of the reasons were in the situation we are today
1123020 i certainly stand behind the governors stance that we need to have long term budget solutions and we can do that without raising taxes

1123025 now the board feels it is time for new leadership to take the business to the next level
1123026 unaudited numbers indicate that key results will be revenue of between 152 million and 156 million up by 41 per cent to 46 per cent and ebitda of between 35 million and 37 million up by 49 per cent to 57 per cent
1123027 more than 22 400 paying agents as at 30 june 08 up by 5 400 paying agents from 30 june 07
1123028 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
1123029 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
1123030 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
1123031 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great
1123032 if prices stay at these levels that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production among sectors and countries
1123033 you could have a very significant shock to traditional consumption patterns and also some important growth effects
1123034 the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today
1123035 has effectively offset all the trade liberalization efforts of the last three decades

1123038 basically if that vulnerability hadnt been solved as quickly as it was you could have a lot of people going after it and exploiting that vulnerability there could have been a lot of damage

1123042 people bring up security vulnerabilities all the time at first your reaction is a little skeptical
1123043 there exist threats to the continued correct running of the internet
1123044 we have found one of them there may be more
1123045 it was them talking about security engineering and how they take security seriously it would have put apple in a positive light

1123047 for the time being the ps2 doesnt seem to be left in the lurch and seems destined to actually live up to the much vaunted 10 year life cycle that sony keeps talking about
1123048 some developers like atlus and sega are still supporting the system with new exclusive games like persona 4 and yakuza 2 respectively with no shortage of guitar heroes or maddens the systems library isnt nearly as bleak as one would assume for a console entering the full decade stretch
1123049 with consumer and business confidence falling and sky high oil prices the situation will get a lot worse
1123050 ive just started researching the subject and dont really know what im talking about
1123051 if standardization of the nutrition practice is left in the hands of a single professional organization the potential bias caused by financial arrangements raises important questions it is a dangerous mistake to establish in law a monopoly on nutritional counseling
1123052 im very troubled by laws that prevent anyone including professors of nutrition from giving nutrition advice unless they are registered dietitians

1123060 we now look forward to executing on our strategy and continuing to build our great company yahoo has made significant strides in executing on its strategy in the last year performing particularly well in light of the challenging circumstances of the past six months
1123061 the company needs to make some fundamental changes if its going to improve its performance and stock price yahoo is too bloated right now they need to reduce head count focus on core businesses and divest some of their holdings that arent making any money
1123062 but its only about the second inning of the company comeback although its been the second inning for a long time there have been a lot of pitches and foul balls
1123063 ive heard our strategy described as spreading peanut butter across the myriad opportunities that continue to evolve in the online world the result a thin layer of investment spread across everything we do and thus we focus on nothing in particular i hate peanut butter we all should
1123064 that came out almost two years ago but its as fresh today as it was back then
1123065 theyve been doing stuff but obviously most of those criticisms are still valid today its going to take a lot of work to get back on track and new leadership and preferably from the outside
1123066 we overplayed our hand with microsoft yes it would have been a great deal for the shareholders and for the company
1123067 we should have taken the deal at 31 per share or about 47 billion in cash obviously they the board disagree with what i think but this doesnt surprise me they think a poison pill is a good idea but i dont think its completely dead i believe microsoft will come back around next year and try again
1123068 i believe it is simply due to microsofts weakness in its online services division you look at their last quarters numbers for that group and its clear that they are falling further behind their desktop business also showed deceleration yahoo helps with both problems
1123069 i had never used microsoft search before a couple of weeks ago i sat down to try it and then realized i had no idea what to type in i tried microsoft com but the only search bar was to help me search msft internal directories i then remembered seeing some advertisement for live search so i tried livesearch com it was some spam site finally i tried live com and the results were no good i will never use it again when i want to google or find yahoo i know what to punch in simple as that

1123279 we are going to solve the energy crisis that is effecting businesses like national label company and we need an all of the above approach we need to aggressively develop alternative energies like wind solar tide bio fuels and geothermal we also need to expand our use of existing resources here at home that means we need more nuclear power it means we need more clean coal technology and that means we need to offshore drill for oil and natural gas we need to drill here and we need to drill now and anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1123280 unfortunately senator obama continues to oppose offshore drilling he continues to oppose the use of nuclear power these misguided polices would result in higher energy costs to american families and business and increase our dependence on foreign oil we are not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1123281 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1123282 in addition well find safer ways to use nuclear power and store nuclear waste

1123311 it suit is certainly something you dont expect to see in college i dont know all the facts but i definitely dont blame o d hes got to do what he feels is the best thing for his team to me i would think the two sides could have sat down and worked things out it just seems this suing is taking it to too big of an extreme
1123312 when i read about it i was floored its a bit frightening i dont know all the details so its difficult to make any judgment but i also find it hard to second guess anything coach vincent does hes a great coach and a great promoter of the college game i just hate to see things like this go in that lawsuit direction
1123313 im not sure about everything thats going on so its hard to have an opinion it just seems like its a very complicated thing its all pretty strange thats for sure
1123314 i dont know a lot about what its all about but i do know that o d has always been an equal opportunity coach he holds qualifiers for walk ons and has always been fair with everyone
1123315 you hear the story so many times about players who say the coach doesnt like them and treats them unfairly but sometimes you just have to face the music and get on with it
1123316 the bad part of all this is now it just hurts the golf program and all the other players to me there was no consideration taken for the other guys on the team
1123317 to me it is disappointing that a disagreement could escalate into something like this i certainly would have thought something could have gotten worked out
1123318 i would never think of suing thats taking things to an extreme i would tell my son to either think about transferring to a different school or staying and finishing his education i mean that should be the most important thing anyway you have to just go on about your life
1123319 suing seems a little bit too much i was pretty shocked when i first saw something about it players can not like a coach or a coach might not like a player but i think suing is taking it a bit too far
1123320 i think if he giulani wanted to transfer o d would have helped him with that in any way he could somehow i just dont think o d kicked him to the curb
1123321 i wasnt happy with the way things were going with jon at tcu but i never thought of suing now if they didnt let him go give him his release to transfer i would have really been very upset i was upset
1123322 im sure it was a different situation there at duke something happened i just feel bad for andrew and the whole situation i know him and have watched him play hes a good kid and a pretty good player its just too bad it all had to come to this for everyone involved
1123323 but we can all give sacrificially how can you not invest when you see such fruit

1123372 we thought the best thing we could do is to direct people to give in honor of our wedding
1123373 the only disappointing thing is that all of the people who donated to us were gay friends or couples

1123409 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
1123410 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on
1123411 for this reason the sanction imposed will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held on tuesday
1123412 i rang him and then i saw him walking down and then because there was a bit of a crowd around me i just told him to go because i didnt really need him there at that point

1123428 the best chance weve learned is with a different city and given that were talking 20 to 30 years before we could do it again i think a lot will come down to how brisbane develops in terms of further infrastructure hotels and whatever by then
1123429 i couldnt and wouldnt say to the queensland government or the brisbane city council to go out and build a new swimming pool but infrastructure is important villages in the past have been around university sites for instance it would be smart to at least have somewhere in mind but certainly i wouldnt be counselling them to go building anything because what you build now would be outdated by then
1123430 my view is that this is something brisbane should throw its hat in the ring for
1123431 it is a 10 15 years thing and something we would have to work through
1123432 there are significant issues with brisbanes infrastructure apart from sporting infrastructure hotel roads public transport and water infrastructure needs would have to be addressed
1123433 im very positive about this and quite pleased that john coates has the confidence that brisbane could stage a future olympics

1123435 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite

1123437 if he is unable to get to advanced base camp tomorrow from where a helicopter can evacuate him then he might be sling lifted but this is a very technical operation and needs a lot of preparation
1123438 has some problems with his arms and legs due to freezing an attempt will be made tomorrow to rescue him

1123440 coming out the second day you kind of know what to expect
1123441 youre a little sore the next day but everybody is at this point
1123442 i have fresh legs so its kind of nice to come out and be fresh and try and get after it
1123443 im not necessarily trying to go out there and go full go ill go as much as i need to go and let those guys know and just work my way back into the program work my way back into the defense
1123444 im nowhere i need to be as far as preparation conditioning
1123445 i feel good i fell well enough to get out here and get practicing
1123446 i sat down he said as a wide grin crossed his face
1123447 i sat down the whole offseason i made a promise to myself last year as soon as i got those surgeries taken care of that i wouldnt move a muscle until i was full go
1123448 i just want to as best as i can to get on the field stay healthy throughout the season and just do what i can to help the team win
1123449 i just want to complement the guys and go out there on special teams and if they call on me on offense to be prepared and go out there to do my job
1123450 i just started working on it said slater its something that helps me with concentration i feel its really benefitting me
1123451 once you get here its ground zero youve got to earn it and what you did in college is over
1123452 youve got to come out here make a name for yourself and work just as hard as any of the other guys if not harder

1123462 i tried to photograph an officer who grabbed a girl by her ponytail and dragged her through the middle of the street she was just wearing a thin tank top and the ground she was pulled over was covered in glittering broken glass as soon as i took out my camera i was tackled by another cop in full riot gear and my equipment was broken this behavior by the police and the atmosphere it created felt very similar to what i would later witness photographing in the deadly conflict zones of haiti burma iraq and palestine these were places where people felt intense fear and anger toward oppressors and occupiers
1123463 it is very commercially oriented its getting boring and now the us is getting like that
1123464 i felt that this was my hometown right away its so mixed i love it
1123465 some is good and it might be a natural way of developing human society its everywhere but if it happens too quickly and if it ignores the suffering of the needy it creates a negative impact like the spread of globalization or americanization

1123508 israel decided to take the humanitarian decision to transfer to jericho 87 residents of the shujaiya neighbourhood in gaza because of the violence carried out by hamas
1123509 we talked with them on the bus and we told them that jericho and the west bank are different from the gaza strip and that the israeli army controls this region they have to respect the law
1123510 are mainly young people aged between 14 and 20 years who will remain in jericho indefinitely their families will not be allowed to join them
1123511 received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
1123512 we never wanted anyone to leave in this regrettable way
1123513 this is a path that does harm to them because by the mere act of fleeing a person places himself in the realm of suspicion
1123514 we condemn the criminal acts undertaken by the hamas leadership against the palestinian people in shujaiya in gaza
1123515 these criminal acts have forced a number of people to flee to israel including women and children and so president abbas has called on a number of parties to rescue those who are in danger from the hamas militia

1123550 mccains narrowing lead traces not to any sudden up swelling in support for obama whose support has hovered around 38 percent for the past year and remains at that level today rather it traces to a decline in support of mccain especially among men registered independents and latinos simultaneously the proportion of voters who are uncommitted rose to 16 percent from only nine this may and ralph nader drew a small but important three percent mostly from mccain

1123580 a central premise of this guidebook is that gang problems are local and solutions must be based on improving understanding of the nature of those problems and the immediate underlying conditions that give rise to them
1123581 widely regarded in the field for his research on gang activity dr decker offers sensible information for local agencies to use in developing responses to their specific gang problem
1123582 the reality is that most responses to problems such as gang crime do not succeed at least in their first design
1123583 it is therefore important to document the process of designing and implementing a response so that the responding jurisdiction and others can be more successful in the future
1123584 all four components of sara are critical the model requires careful analysis before creating interventions
1123585 the gang problem is highly dynamic its important to avoid developing a fixed image of a problem that does not change as the problem changes
1123586 growing evidence shows that sustained application of the sara model greatly improves the law enforcement response to gangs and leads to safer communities
1123587 the good news is that many police departments are improving their effectiveness at developing and implementing problem solving strategies
1123588 we are seeing more organizations using data based strategic responses to issues like gang crime rather than simply putting the same fire out over and over

1123598 last year i never used to eat right now i eat healthy and work out a lot last season i played at 205 pounds and right now im 225 so i put on about 20 pounds hopefully it will help me through the long haul this season i thought i was a little small at 205 and i worked out a little bit toward the end of the year and i felt that if i put on some weight and muscle i could maybe last a little longer and be stronger towards the end of the season so thats pretty much my goal
1123599 i think our wideouts are probably the most talented group we have on the team obviously mike jones and chris mcgaha are our proven guys who made a lot of plays for us i think kerry taylor is going to have a really good year this year he has worked hard and hes good kyle williams is another guy who has had a great summer and is going to really help us this year also our freshman gerell robinson is the guy who is the most ready to play he spent a lot of time with us in the off season and i think he will make a difference for us this year
1123600 i think it will really help us out like i said we need to have all those guys in the field like those wideouts because theyre our best group we cant have them sitting on the bench and i think if we can just get the ball in my hands and get it to those guys fast and let them make plays that will be a key in our passing game and help from people blitzing us so much
1123601 its hard to make a big play when youre going through short routes and you have to get it out im more worried about doing what is best for our team and helping the team out so if they have to get it out of my hand then that is what i am going to do
1123602 to be honest i dont really know i do know we are ranked no 16 in the coaches poll and no 2 in the pac 10 but expectations are expectations i expect to have our team win as many games as we can all the expectations will take care of themselves at the end of the year i think we just have to be worried about taking one game at a time
1123603 part of me loves it because it will be a great opportunity for us as a university and as a football team to show what we can do against some of the best teams in the country we are going to be in front of the national media which is going to get us out there even more than last year if we can do well then again its pretty rough because we have georgia cal usc and oregon all in row and two of those four are on the road so that can be a pretty difficult stretch if you dont take care of things because we could be hurting by that time of year
1123604 its unbelievable thomas is really a huge asset to our team because we can put points on the board from all over the field he really helped us out last year because we had trouble scoring sometimes so it is great having a good kicker and it is great having faith in a kicker
1123605 i think they will help hopefully well find out when we start practice tomorrow as soon as we start playing against our defense well see if it is going to help us out but i think if we can run those new things we put in effectively it will slow down some teams from really blitzing us like they did last year
1123606 i think it will be better because we have all of our facilities here technology for film our weight room and our training facilities for when guys get hurt we dont have all that stuff up there so i think it makes it a lot easier being here and its more convenient guys get more rest and sleep better without all the traveling it will at least help make guys more enthusiastic during camp when it starts to get hard and well be better because of that
1123607 i think we just know what to expect from the coaching staff we know how they are how they run practices and do everything on and off the field they also know how we are we all have a better feel for how things go and obviously its much different than from when coach koetter was here and were all adjusted to that weve adjusted to the new teams on offense and defense and i think the second year will be better than the first year
1123608 it means a lot to me actually because its rare that people start a lot of consecutive games for a couple reasons people always want somebody else and on top of that injuries can happen so im thankful and im grateful that i have had the opportunity to play a lot of games and i have been healthy to do that i also know that experience usually helps a lot throughout the course of the season especially at my position
1123609 the less you blitz the better off you are youre a little more sound across the board if our front four can get pressure and we can sit seven deep then thats going to be great for our pass defense its when teams keep six or seven in thats where we can get creative and find new ways to get pressure were going to put a couple of blitzes in were definitely going to blitz and if were having trouble getting pressure then were going to create a little more hopefully our front four especially with our ends will be able to minimize that as much as possible
1123610 spring helped quite a bit robert james did a lot of the blitzing for us last year and we need somebody to step up and fill that whole be able to get pressure and create movement in the pocket if we cant find that in the fall then were just going to have to find another way to get pressure
1123611 a couple of the young guys with oliver aaron they really have that burst that robert had they just got to be a little more consistent throughout fall camp and they will be able to help us out a lot come fall
1123612 so far over summer he is making all the times jon is fast and he should help us but he has a lot of things he needs to work on like being disciplined and taking it all in hes also still young too but he should help us a lot
1123613 usually you know before the play if youre going to be doubled team or not just by playing a shade or a 3 its tough but at times you have to make a play and youll find a way to do it hopefully i can make some this year
1123614 most of it is experience with the speed of the game when you got a 12 play drive compared to a 3 play drive its a lot different and it got me ready for my senior year i just cant wait and those long plays wont even hurt me with the experience

1123652 this is always an exciting time for everybody in college football everybody is undefeated you get a chance to talk about whats going to happen in the future its a fun time for me its as fun as there is theres nothing like college football the anticipation what tv game is on whos going to win the national championship whos going to go to the rose bowl and all those different things thats what makes it such a great sport this is a great time were excited about our football team weve got a lot of returners back in a lot of different areas and weve got a lot of areas where weve got to have people step up and where were going to be very young i dont know that its unlike any year that youre going to have youre going to have people coming back and experience and youre going to have inexperience to me its a matter of how you come together what happens during two a days what happens in the fall injuries who steps up and all those different things we had a very good summer from what i understand as far as the offseason workouts thats how it is anymore its an all around every month everyday job anymore there is no time off our guys spent a lot of time here with our strength coach and did a lot of things on their own hopefully it pays off for them
1123653 well continue to close that gap weve had good players here as ive said many times coach dirk koetter did an outstanding job recruiting here were continuing to do that were going to be very young at some positions our recruiting class that we got a year ago were going to have a lot of those guys playing particularly in the offensive line this class coming in its good on paper theyre all good on paper but well find out tomorrow exactly where theyre at we feel very good about some of those young guys we really think that they can help us this year but that remains to be seen where were at right now we wont know until we start you dont know how good you are until you start playing a lot of times it takes three or four games to even find out where youre at sometimes it takes longer than that
1123654 having an experienced quarterback is huge theres no question about it quarterback is a very key position is it the total answer obviously its not the total answer but its nice to have a guy like rudy carpenter coming back whos played as many games as hes played theres nothing like playing you can have a guy thats very talented and there are a lot of them in our league and a lot of new ones in our league that are going to be playing but theres nothing like having that experience on the football field with rudy coming back i feel very good about that aspect of it not only has he played a lot hes been very successful hes a guy were depending on hes been a real leader for us since hes been here hes been a real leader this summer for us as far as organizing the things that needed to get done were very fortunate
1123655 i certainly hope so i expect him being in our offense for a year and understanding what we want were adding some things too that will really help him in my opinion were a little different team offensively just because of our personnel than we were a year ago just the experience of the rush getting the football off on time when people are in your face getting hit in the mouth which he did a number of times all that really makes a big difference
1123656 i dont know if its an advantage or a disadvantage we made a decision a year ago that we were going to get a new facility here it has nothing to do with tontozona at all its about our indoor facility we really feel that well have one of the best indoor facilities in the country it wasnt just about that it was about being to work in there in the summer time being able to work in there in the winter being able to work in there in the heat not just during training camp but during the season when we need to that is such a plus when you look inside of it and go inside of it weve got so much room more than any of the places ive been as far as practice facilities are concerned its going to be a huge advantage for us so in saying that there was no reason for us to go up there because of weather theres an advantage to staying at home as far as facilities film work our own weight room and all those different things tontozona has been great for this program over the years and it was great for us last year it doesnt have to anything to do with wanting to go up there or not its just our new facility
1123657 no i dont believe we have i try to put those memories behind me if we have thats tough you look at our schedule we play northern arizona on aug 30 michigan appalachian state coach jerome souers has done a great job up there and theyve got a great opportunity to come down here ive been on both ends of that stanford to me is huge thats our first league game at home you can go on and on its a tough stretch theres no question about it the thing about schedules is and ive grown to live with this the last four or five months the schedule is the schedule and you go play it you play them when theyre there and just go play them
1123658 i knew theyd be on top and i knew wed play them both you knew what it was going to be like those are two great programs and we just happened to play both of them we happen to play both of them again next year so thats just how it is
1123659 weve got to establish our offensive front theres no question about that were going to be young in talking about that richard tuituu who was at right tackle for us last year will not play this year he decided not to play football so adam tello will be our starter im excited about our offensive front but it is an area thats young weve got shawn lauvao and paul fanaika coming back theyre the two experienced guys and everybody else is going to be new theyre athletic and it will be exciting to see how they come about thats a real big question so well see what happens but thats probably the biggest one weve got right now
1123660 were going to be involved in some different things as far as what were doing offensively ive been in a lot of offenses in my coaching career and spread it out before people were spreading it out so were going to do some of that get it off quick and try to give him a little bit better opportunities when youre in three and five step drops you get it off a little quicker hell get rid of it the offense will be conducive to him getting rid of it
1123661 a lot of it depends on what our depth is there will be some that will play in my mind there will probably be four or five of them but who they are im not sure we need some help in the defensive front to develop some depth so thats a possibility same thing in the secondary at corner and or safety at wide receiver gerell robinson probably has a chance to compete and play its a good class well see where theyre at but i wouldnt be surprised to see four or five of those true freshmen play
1123662 weve got a lot of starters back so were about the same as we were a year ago i think were a little bit faster weve got some young guys that will play and continue to improve our speed we will continue to improve our speed all the time thats what we believe in defensively to play fast and play very aggressive our defensive philosophy is based on guys that can run so our defense every year will continue to get faster we will continue to keep it simple like we have we really believe that if you dont have to think you play faster thats what we were able to do last year now well add some different things maybe bring a little bit more pressure because were a little bit more experienced but speed is the key on defense for us
1123663 our skill areas offensively at running back and wide receiver is a strength for us any time you have keegan herring coming back and kyle williams mike jones at receiver so we do have some skill and then you throw rudy carpenter in there thats an area that i like our experience at safety with troy nolan linebacker will all those guys that played quite a bit last year mike nixon travis goethel gerald munns so we do have some experience and i dont know that there is anybody thats got a pair of defensive ends like luis vasquez and dexter davis that we have right now weve got to find a third one but theyre pretty good
1123664 well find out its hard to say it kind of depends on how we grow as a football team our goal is going to be the same every year and thats to compete for the championship and to go to the rose bowl were young and inexperienced in a lot of areas so well see how we grow and how we develop depth and then go ahead and go from there i like our team theyve had a good summer theyll compete and play hard and then well see what happens
1123665 we know each other the players know the coaches and we know the players they know how we react to things we know how they react to things its nice being around them for a year it makes a big difference last year we werent sure what to expect and im sure they werent sure what to expect of us thats the biggest difference
1123666 adam had a good spring it was a toss up who was going to start at right tackle for us anyway adam is young but hes very athletic a very good pass protector i feel good about him weve got dennis erickson named semifinalist for 19th annual george munger coach of the year award

1123712 ive also had to mediate difficult situations at empact spc which is something i learned through the social work program my internship with the miss foundation a non profit organization created by asu assistant professor joanne cacciatore dedicated to providing support to grieving individuals and families helped me learn to deal compassionately with raw emotion such as grief while staying focused on meeting the needs of the person and the family
1123713 what i have learned is that i can do it
1123714 it may be hard but you get there eventually even with my family were not there yet but weve come a long way
1123715 even if i were in the same position now as i was 10 years ago it wouldnt be as overwhelming because i have seen the support and where it comes from and i have grown personally and i see the light there was a time i didnt know if there was a way out
1123716 but the emphasis cant be on me because it isnt fair to those you are serving

1123782 needless to say tim felt the same way and in the opening episode time burns his star wars stuff on a funeral pyre the scene recreates exactly the moment when luke burns the body of his father at the end of return of the jedi i think it reflected the feelings of many fans for the first time ever there was a division in a group of people that had always felt very united fortunately i had an outlet for my displeasure in one scene tim screams at a little boy for wanting to buy a jar jar binks doll it summed up the frustration of the older fans whose expectations were so high and the innocence of the small children for whom it was a colorful and exciting film
1123783 the prequels and special editions are probably the most heated debate topics among star wars fans
1123784 when i watched star wars in 1977 it blew my mind and i loved it unconditionally i never once sat there in the dark thinking this is good but what it really needs is a jawa falling off a dinosaur in the background were all fans here and ultimately were all united by the same love and id hate to alienate anyone so i wont go into huge detail about my problems with the prequels

1123787 olmerts unique value was that he approached peace as a pragmatist none of this starry eyed peres stuff it was we israelis want to have normal lives we want to have nice houses and take our families to football games and make money to do this we have to lay this conflict behind us there was no mush
1123788 i continue to believe with all my heart that achieving peace stopping terrorism strengthening security and creating different relations with our neighbors are the most vital goals for the future of the state of israel
1123789 we are closer than ever to concrete understandings that are likely to the basis for agreements in the two strands of dialogue the palestinian and the syrian the moment we achieve peace we will stand baffled and wonder how we did not achieve this earlier

1123873 what we are doing is going beyond what the legislation outlines during a disease outbreak but this is an extraordinary case
1123874 it gives us enough to be able to start to move forward
1123875 its certainly not enough to necessarily get us out of trouble but we dont expect that
1123876 so it gives us now an opportunity to work through this and hopefully keep our enterprise going
1123877 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time

1123884 for the victims they have to take care of its own consequences if they got it through illegal unlawful means
1123885 currently we dont have much information but we are against the unlawful practice of scalping in the ticket sales
1123886 we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate or find substitute tickets or whatever
1123887 we struggled initially to get any tickets in the first round and were very distraught because we have quite a large party here
1123888 we were struggling to get two tickets for our family to the beach volleyball but weve managed through the help of the aoc and cosport to get everyone a seat right now

1123893 sadly there are some fraudulent dealers known as scalpers who are out to cheat fans
1123894 only tickets purchased from or obtained through official or authorised sources will enable entry to venues detailed information on ticket sources is available on the official beijing 2008 ticketing website www tickets beijing2008 cn
1123895 anyone who has bought tickets from unofficial or unauthorised sources runs the risk of having those tickets cancelled being refused entry and or being asked to leave the venue without receiving a refund or qualifying for an exchange of ticket

1123900 with the fact that the activity data has come in weaker than expected the economy is slowing quite considerably we should get the reserve bank providing more words in their statement to the fact that growth is slowing
1123901 we should get the reserve bank providing more words in their statement to the fact that growth is slowing

1123906 when i was a teenager i remember reading letters to the editor in my local paper where the grown ups were arguing about whether to allow students to use calculators the unspoken worry was that since calculators had appeared so suddenly the might disappear just as suddenly what none of the grown ups in that conversation understood was that there would never be a day when we needed to divide two seven digit numbers on paper what seemed to them like a provisional new capability was actually a deep and permanent shift one we students recognized immediately

1123926 limits his ability to identify enemy locations by sound hear commands from his team leaders hear radio traffic over a squad radio or speak with local nationals in combat which could have negative ramifications to the mission
1123927 hearing loss is present in all forms in the army
1123928 its impossible to validate whether he will lose his hearing more or less in the future i feel that infantry is his best place
1123929 thats kevin wanting to lead his men and do the right thing
1123930 wants to stay infantry this is his life i vote he stays infantry
1123931 i came to terms with myself and realized that i was not as confident in my ability to continue my job
1123932 it was better for me to realize this than to ignore it
1123933 i dont know how to approach commanders and tell them of what my feelings are
1123934 because ive been around long enough to know that ill be looked at as a quitter
1123935 we see cases of soldiers deploying when they did not meet the hearing standards
1123936 the commander has to make the call based on the mission but the doctors should make the case very clearly that deploying cpl x against his or her medical judgment is a decision that could be held against the commander
1123937 this is a disability you dont want to get worse
1123938 you dont want this person to be put in a position where he might hurt himself or others
1123939 they say my symptoms are mimicking signs of depression who the hell knows what that means
1123940 they gave me three sheets of paper with breathing techniques another describing how to imagine being in a happy place and to remind myself to relax when i started getting anxious
1123941 for them to tell me to think happy thoughts is what will resolve my issues immediately i have no faith in their judgment
1123942 staff sgt dunne attested that he could fulfill his duties
1123943 dunne relayed that he did not want to let down his soldiers so he did not report his condition
1123944 you cant ask the person to make the determination because emotionally theyre too connected to wanting to overcome their disability
1123945 assorted items on curb at intersection of x and y picture
1123946 so aba con compartir una cancha con l era uno de los jugadores que m s miraba en uruguay
1123947 el t cnico me dio la oportunidad y no siento la presi n de jugar en el lugar de ortega porque el f tbol es lo que m s me gusta y no podr a jugar as
1123948 imi dau jos maieul si chilotii raman trufasa in picioare dezbracata uitandu ma sfidator
1123949 in the school of the future lessons are divided into 25 minute modules cyclically repeated throughout the day subject a is taught for 25 minutes constituting the first exposure ninety minutes later the 25 minute content of subject a is repeated and then a third time
1123950 in the future school every third or fourth day would be reserved for reviewing the facts delivered in the previous 72 to 96 hours during these review holidays previous information would be presented in compressed fashion students would have the chance to inspect the notes they took during the initial exposures comparing them with what the teacher was saying in the review
1123951 it is quite possible that such models would eradicate the need for homework
1123952 today students are expected to know certain things by certain grades curiously absent from this model is how durable that learning remains after the student completes the grade given that system consolidation can take years might the ideas of grade level expectations need amending perhaps learning in the long view should be thought of the same way one thinks of immune booster shots with critical pieces of information being repeated on a yearly or semi yearly basis
1123953 mr iksidis chose a workforce that he knew or suspected would be pliable and bullied them if they complained
1123954 this was a case involving a number of disabled people all the employees involved in this sort of work were likely to be vulnerable to a greater or lesser extent
1123955 supermarket trolley return is after all scarcely at the top of the employment pecking order it is reasonable to suppose that those doing this work were desperate for the employment
1123956 they were given deliberately confusing contracts of employment and bullied if they stood up for their rights
1123957 i also accept that the employees were given contracts of employment of considerable complexity governing matters totally irrelevant such as ownership of inventions and the like not inadvertently but as part of a general tactic by the employer to intimidate
1123958 i further accept that responses to queries made by employees as to their rates of pay were met by aggressive legally oriented and threatening correspondence
1123959 substantial amounts of money which would have been enormous to employees earning low wages
1123960 it is apparent that this is an industry with what might be described as widespread problems
1123961 we rely on encouraging voluntary compliance with workplace laws but we will be tough where we need to be
1123962 all businesses small and large have an obligation to meet minimum employment standards and their employees have an expectation that this will occur
1123963 oops i left the porch light on overnight and flattened me battery
1123964 raise math scores in 4th grade by 10 points as evidenced by the district assessments and end of year state test scores
1123965 this was public relations at its finest school personnel talking directly with community leaders who are influential and will spread the good news that was shared with them this personal contact is immeasurable
1123966 in my experience one of the most common reasons that programs products and change initiatives dont work is that the wrong question has been asked
1123967 with a made up concept and a few words the unknown becomes simple and satisfying
1123968 a centralized organization is easy to understand think of any major company or governmental agency you have a clear leader whos in charge and theres a specific place where decisions are made the boardroom the corporate headquarters city hall nevins calls this organizational type coercive because the leaders call the shots
1123969 in a decentralized organization theres no clear leader no hierarchy and no headquarters
1123970 nevins calls this an open system because everyone is entitled to make his or her own decisions this doesnt mean that a decentralized system is the same as anarchy there are rules and norms but these arent enforced by any one person rather the power is distributed among all the people and across geographic regions
1123971 open source relies on the publish then filter pattern in traditional organizations trying anything is expensive even if just in staff time to discuss the idea so someone must make some attempt to filter the successes from the failures in advance in open systems the cost of trying something is so low that handicapping the likelihood of success is often an unnecessary distraction
1123972 open system by reducing the cost of failure enable their participants to fail like crazy building on the successes as they go
1123973 the idea is that for any problem or goal there is a vast area of possibilities to explore but few valuable spots within that environment to discover when a company or indeed any organization finds a strategy that works the drive to adopt it and stick with it is strong even if there is a better strategy out there finding is can be prohibitively expensive
1123974 any market of people with sufficient resources will get very pick on you
1123975 back in 04 the olympic teams performance in athens left a great deal to be desired
1123976 i had no idea at that moment that i would be asked if i would consider taking over the program but i did have a prerequisite full autonomy
1123977 i was aware of how things were structured in the past and i felt we needed to change the culture
1123978 with this program weve asked them to be committed to playing for their country and not just to play
1123979 these guys have done that over the last two years weve seen this program develop to where whether it be lebron james kobe bryant or jason kidd they feel like theyre part of a team part of a movement and theyre very proud to represent the united states
1123980 i think in some respects over the years weve been pretty arrogant saying its our game its not our game its the worlds game and the respect weve shown to international basketball over the last two years will pay dividends
1123981 when were with our teams we complain i wish i had chris paul in the backcourt or i wish i had dwight howard
1123982 i want this guy i want that guy because we all want to win
1123983 well everyone is in the room everyone is here theres no excuses now we have to get the job done
1123984 obviously the most talented team without a question in the world
1123985 ive learned a lot about these individuals getting to talk with them and look them in the eye
1123986 as far as garnett is concerned we never got any positive feedback
1123987 it was more about ive been there ive done that its time for someone else to do it
1123988 i think we have a unique opportunity right now in representing our country and not just by going for the gold medal in beijing
1123989 we can set a standard for how the game should be played right now in our own country with teamwork with camaraderie with enthusiasm with an attention to detail that makes basketball such a great team game
1123990 this team is showing all of that hopefully well show it at an even higher level and that will serve as an example for the kids growing up where basketball wont be all about a sound bite or a highlight dunk
1123991 when was the last time you as a customer called the support line for a product you own to complain about its lack of innovation or sent a meal back to the kitchen at a restaurant because it wasnt innovative enough in the course of ordinary life the word innovation doesnt surface much and this is good innovation as a word a concept or an agenda is entirely overrated its a vague subjective term that distracts from what youre really trying to do enjoy your life or in the case of a business profit by making good things
1123992 the truth is making really good things is difficult it requires a commitment to craft an attention to detail and a love for work that has always been rare and while wed never call these three attributes innovations its the success of creating an organization that rewards these things that leads to the products we often herald after theyre done as innovations
1123993 ahora veo que fernando est mucho m s relajado sabe lo dif cil que lo tiene este a o pero est aguantando bien

1123996 era una congelaci n de motores y nuestro motor ha quedado congelado
1123997 i was going to say i wish someone would ring the bell and say were across the line but i actually dont because im really enjoying the ride at the moment and the challenge
1123998 but there is absolutely no prize whatsoever for being in the eight after 21 rounds
1123999 we may or may not be good enough to make it weve got to prove that over the next five weeks
1124000 if were good enough we will if we dont well be glum
1124001 its a results orientated business and we got what we were after tonight
1124002 i thought we lost our way in the game a few times but we did enough to win
1124003 i thought they had a number of things go their way youve got to give them some credit the way they played
1124004 we knew that the team that lost it would make it harder for them to make the finals but its doesnt make it insurmountable for our team
1124005 but there are some areas we need to sort out as far as our team is concerned clearly there is not an easy fix
1124006 i dont think i would be sitting here today if i wasnt 100 percent confident that everything is going to be perfectly fine
1124007 he moores likes to challenge us he likes to challenge us on a daily basis there are a lot of strong characters and opinionated people in the dressing room and i think yesterday i sat down with peter and we had a really good discussion on how we want to take this team forward
1124008 my position as a player to becoming captain is now totally different and we need to unite and get onto the same hymn sheet and we need to get this team going forward
1124009 he likes to challenge players but the crux of yesterdays meeting was to determine and decipher where peter and myself can take this england team
1124010 i hope it wont restrict the way i play and i think it will be silly for me to start thinking it definitely will affect the way i play
1124011 i play the way i play and its a way that ive been successful with so far in my career and its something i want to try and keep at a really high level
1124012 we dont have plans to call congress into session it wont make a difference if democratic leaders are unwilling to bring up a bill for an up down vote
1124013 oh i dont want to do track because im bored
1124014 you have this wonderful bike engine lets use that and then lets walk fast
1124015 youre good at that because youre bad at any of the individual disciplines
1124016 im willing to give it a go because im crap anyway
1124017 i had all these guys and they all struggled for money before the team
1124018 ive tried this for three months now im gonna try this
1124019 what youre reading in magazines is what you think people are doing this this is what we are doing

1124025 o aparelho deve ser colocado na boca 20 minutos antes das refei es desse modo ele faz com que o corpo inicie a digest o antes mesmo que o paciente comece a comer isso ocorre porque a saliva o e a degluti o intensas provocadas pela sua presen a fazem com que o c rebro se engane e entenda que a digest o j come ou

1124030 the board of directors of the obuasi health insurance scheme have realized that the neighbourhood hospital is milking the scheme and we will not sit down unconcerned hence our decision to suspend the facility
1124031 indeed statistics presented in december last year show that out of the total attendance of 1 721 which includes adults and children 935 patients were given 28 tablets of diclofenac suppository each representing 54 per cent of the entire attendance
1124032 as i speak to you now the bekwai district has submitted claim forms from neighbourhood hospital for audit following suspicion of fraudulent practices in the forms
1124033 we members of the above mentioned group of obuasi humbly wish to appeal to the highly respected board members and the entire stakeholders of the obuasi mutual health insurance scheme to reconsider the legitimate decision made by the board to suspend neighbourhood hospital from the national health insurance scheme nhis
1124034 though it may be argued that there are other health facilities in the township to provide health service to us and the other affected persons who have registered with the scheme we likewise strongly believe that the majority of the people like us who consider dr
1124035 in a case of this nature we have no other options than to pay for our medical treatments though we are registered to the scheme

1124037 its impossible to accurately identify the species of animal from the photo there is no scale from which to judge its size
1124038 it is impossible to accurately identify the species of animal from the photo there is no scale from which to judge its size additionally when a body has had prolonged exposure to water and predators it can be altered or appear different from its normal form if we had the actual body we could tell you what it is however from viewing the lower canine tooth and other physical characteristics evident in the picture we could guess it may be a dog or raccoon i can state categorically that it is not associated with the work performed at plum island animal disease center piadc piadc serves as the nations first line of defense against foreign animal diseases of livestock by identifying such diseases through diagnostic testing and by developing vaccines to protect livestock from those diseases

1124043 ich erwarte dass da eine einigung zustande kommt wenn nur geredet wird braucht man auch keinen gipfel
1124044 meine empfehlung an die unternehmen lautet schafft diese verg nstigungen f r aufsichtsr te ab
1124045 wer darauf verzichtet pers nliche verg nstigungen zu gew hren vermeidet missverst ndnisse und alle spekulationen ber interessenskonflikte
1124046 alle geldwerten vorteile f r aufsichtsratsmitglieder m ssen abgeschafft werden
1124047 die vertreter der betrieblichen mitbestimmung sollten keine pers nlichen vorteile die ber die finanzielle verg tung hinausgehen daraus ziehen d rfen
1124048 doch beide seiten m ssen auch bereit sein ber diese br cke zu gehen
1124049 der antragsgegner hat durch seine ffentliche aufforderung in der woche vor der landtagswahl in hessen die spd spitzenkandidatin andrea ypsilanti und so auch mit der landesstimme f r die wahl der landesliste die eigene partei nicht zu w hlen erheblich gegen das gebot der innerparteilichen solidarit t als grundsatz der partei im sinne von 35 abs 1 und 3 des organisations statuts versto en hierdurch ist schwerer schaden f r die partei entstanden wegen dieses versto es schlie t die landesschiedskommission i den antragsgegner aus der spd aus nicht gegenstand der pr fung und entscheidung der landesschiedskommission und somit unerheblich sind folglich unterschiedliche politische grundausrichtungen der partei links rechts sowie strittige inhaltliche positionen etwa in der energiepolitik oder hinsichtlich der politik der agenda 2010 um diese geht es hier nicht versuche oder vorhalte mit dem mittel des parteiordnungsverfahrens gegen den antragsgegner den kurs der partei zu beeinflussen oder kritiker der parteilinie mundtot zu machen gehen daher ins leere die schiedskommission weist sie zur ck die landesschiedskommission sch tzt das risiko dass es zuk nftig zu vergleichbaren angriffen auf die w hlbarkeit der spd kommt als hoch ein sie st tzt sich auf die eigenen u erungen des antragsgegners
1124050 clement hat es der parteif hrung damit wahrlich nicht einfacher gemacht
1124051 unterschiedliche politische grundausrichtungen der partei links rechts sowie strittige inhaltliche positionen etwa in der energiepolitik oder hinsichtlich der politik der agenda 2010
1124052 angesichts der faktenlage kann er einen freispruch erster klasse nun wirklich nicht erwarten
1124053 this time we are totally against the notion of selecting or picking the running mate from the north we believe that we equally have competent people from the southern and middle belts that can win more votes for the npp
1124054 we think that we are all ghanaians capable of putting our expertise and energy together for the progress of the nation we dont think that the vice position is reserved for the people in the northern region it is unfair for the npp that believes in fairness to allow tribalism to determine who wins the elections for us
1124055 if i gave my money away ill have less of it
1124056 roles of current ceos their impact on economic developments of ghana
1124057 in modern day management control systems and good governance corporate strategies are not left to the ceos to play with they are structured and implemented by the board of directors
1124058 trickers description of various roles played by board of directors tricker r i 1990 from london institute of directors the directors manual pp a6 1 a6 18 tricker listed the following roles that a board member should be
1124059 monitor being an objective overseer a management performance and executive decisions hiring and firing top management
1124060 fielding square pegs in councils boards and authorities who pays the price
1124061 the problem really appears to be the selection of membership to these councils and corporate boards it has never ceased to raise eyebrows and legitimate question
1124062 henbane is a very toxic plant and should never be eaten
1124063 henbane is associated with lots of mythical tales its said to turn you black and its used in witches potions
1124064 you can use the leaves in salads like spinach make tea and eat the roots
1124065 its a bit embarrassing but there have been no reports of any casualties please do pass on my apologies
1124066 as always check with an expert when foraging or collecting wild plants
1124067 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1124068 a lot of people come just to get out of the heat
1124069 we are asking citizens and our visitors to pay attention to the weather and use their own judgment as to whether to ride out the storm on the island knowing there will be power outages during the night or tomorrow
1124070 its not going to be a huge issue for anybody in this area
1124071 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1124072 were on the water right now just putting on extra lines in case it comes up
1124073 as we demonstrated less than two weeks ago with hurricane dolly the state of texas is prepared to respond to tropical storm edouard
1124074 i urge texans along the coast to monitor this storm closely and take necessary precautions to protect their families homes and businesses
1124075 we are very excited to be bringing sports fans of southeast texas a first class professional sports experience that the whole family will enjoy we are thrilled to have a new anchor tenant for the facility and we hope the community will join us in welcoming the new team

1124080 bei koalitionsverhandlunggen zwischen spd und gr nen werden wir nicht mit am tisch sitzen aber man muss mit uns ber eckpunkte reden
1124081 dass unsere partei mit 5 1 prozent der stimmen ihr wahlprogramm nicht eins zu eins umsetzen kann

1124099 dede ja vennaga oleme omavahel arutanud et tingimisi otsus pole ju normaalne
1124100 esiteks oli see meie hinge s litamine teiseks tekitab laiksoo eakaaslastes karistamatuse tunde eesti riigis peab ometi olema mingi v imalus et ka kannatanutel on s na igus ei saa ju nii olla et ks inimene kohtunik toim otsustab k ige le nagu jumal

1124291 the report is on a catalyst that forms upon the oxidative polarization of an inert indium tin oxide electrode in phosphate buffered water containing co2 a variety of analytical techniques indicates the presence of phosphate in an approximate 1 2 ratio with cobalt in this material the ph dependence of the catalytic activity also implicates hpo42 as the proton acceptor in the o2 producing reaction this catalyst not only forms in situ from earth abundant materials but also operates in neutral water under ambient conditions
1124292 we describe an air electrode based on a porous material coated with poly 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene pedot which acts as an o2 reduction catalyst continuous operation for 1500 hours was demonstrated without material degradation or deterioration in performance o2 conversion rates were comparable with those of pt catalyzed electrodes of the same geometry and the electrode was not sensitive to co operation was demonstrated as an air electrode and as a dissolved o2 electrode in aqueous solution
1124293 in natural photosynthesis energy from sunlight is used to rearrange the bonds of water to o2 and h2 equivalents

1124315 no puede haber una sentencia colectiva sino individuales y con ello nos adelantamos a una presunta o posible decisi n del tsj de decir que con una sola decisi n y decir con ello que la sentencia estar a apegada a la constituci n
1124316 no hay ninguna duda que en lo pol tico en lo jur dico en lo constitucional que ganamos la audiencia tan es as que tuvieron poner una cadena televisiva para tapar lo que estaba ocurriendo ah
1124317 la ganamos porque nuestra propuesta fue siempre la constituci n en sus art culos 42 y 65
1124318 nosotros no nos inscribiremos hasta que tengamos un pronunciamiento del tsj la semana pasada fuimos al cne y le planteamos la violaci n de derechos humanos en la que estar an incurriendo si no nos permite la inscripci n a los cargos planteados

1124322 si no les deposito les pongo mi cabeza a la orden y como usted se or pineda no cumpli aqu estamos apostadas y no nos vamos hasta que no nos deposite
1124323 el presidente decret un bono de 6 millones de bol vares y no nos los han cancelado necesitamos respeto porque somos trabajadoras trabajamos desde las 8 de la ma ana hasta las 5 de la tarde pateando los cerros y necesitamos todas nuestras reivindicaciones salariales hoy mismo o no nos movemos nos encadenamos a las puertas
1124324 presidente pele el ojo porque nosotros necesitamos respuestas hoy mismo queremos al due o del circo que es nuestro presidente nosotros somos revolucionarios igual pero que nos paguen no es justo tenemos cinco a os que no nos pagan
1124325 en las tres habilitantes que ha tenido el presidente ha promulgado ya 164 leyes via habilitante estas ultimas 26 se enuncian apenas hoy salen los contenidos el texto de las mismas las analizaremos y discutiremos fijaremos posicion sobre cada una pero evidentemente este enunciamiento de estas leyes no es m s que un fraude a la democracia cometido por el ejecutivo nacional amparado en la ley habilitante
1124326 estaba pensando en una planta de nombre similar no en esta hierba el error es un poco embarazoso pero no ha habido noticias de ning n afectado por favor transmitan mis disculpas

1124333 if the high fuel and energy prices last for a prolonged period of time itll change the way we do business
1124334 three years ago it cost us about 32 000 to heat our facility our costs for the 2008 09 year are estimated at over 100 000 that does not include fuel increases for buses which are more than double from three years ago
1124335 it is only a matter of time before the cost of energy and health benefits cause us to eliminate educational opportunities for students
1124336 fuel and energy costs are not the only cost increases everything is going up paper textbooks wages and salaries benefits insurance data processing and staff development it is hard to isolate fuel and energy from the perfect storm of rising costs
1124337 besides the financial stress on our district we are seeing the stress on families so that they are impacted by their own ability to afford participation etc
1124338 weve begun to explore alternative calendars but are now concerned with the fact that students may be in homes that lack adequate heat
1124339 ya estamos en la huelga de hambre porque el gobierno nos ha reducido nuestros presupuestos hay el riesgo de que las obras viales se paralicen
1124340 when we were talking about ways to mark 50 years since bobby moores debut there was only one true gesture that would do him justice
1124341 he will be a part of this club for generations to come

1124343 last night everything came together and i am now moving to real madrid
1124344 as everybody knows i have always wanted to move to spain because i have a strong bond with that country now im going to play for real madrid its a dream come true
1124345 tomorrow afternoon i will be presented at real madrid this will be the start of a new chapter in my life i will do everything to help the team and the club to win trophies
1124346 rafael was the captain of the team and provided some special football moments with his excellent performances
1124347 we wish him a lot of success with his new challenge
1124348 rafael has developed into one of europes top players while at hsv and with his individual class he played a decisive role in the positive development of hsv
1124349 looking back at the last couple of years im extremely happy that ive had the chance to experience playing for hsv
1124350 no club and no set of fans will treat you with more hospitality than they do
1124351 thanks very much for that his wife sylvie and i will never forget you
1124352 stephen is the third quarterback stephens not going to talk to the media stephen doesnt need anymore attention
1124353 hes had plenty of attention for a guy whos never played a down
1124354 i thank everyone at the university of south carolina that was involved with my reinstatement for giving me another chance to be a student athlete here all i can say is that i will try to be the best student athlete i can during my career here and make this decision a positive one for our university the media attention needs to go to tommy beecher and the other players on our team i will not start talking to the media until i begin playing in the real games here at carolina
1124355 this is kind of fine upstanding player that could have saved coach shula from getting fired rtr mr garcia has been at usc since 07 and still a freshman how in the daggum hell did shula let this one get away rtr bitches
1124356 remember when you were small and had invisible friends i had invisible enemies
1124357 people are getting their understanding of the world from random lunatics riffing in their underwear rather than professional journalists with standards and passports
1124358 remember when you were small and had invisible friends i had invisible enemies
1124359 people are getting their understanding of the world from random lunatics riffing in their underwear rather than professional journalists with standards and passports
1124360 there is this madness around me around my family without a doubt out on the field is where im most comfortable where im happiest because i know what im doing and i know i can do it
1124361 im a really bad loser it stays with me for a while i always take it quite personally when we dont win as a team or i dont win in everything else i do
1124362 people always ask me do you play golf because a majority of sportsmen do i used to play quite a few years ago but to be honest id rather spend four hours with the kids than four hours on a golf course as much as it can be relaxing its a frustrating sport my way of relaxing is listening to music and spending time with the kids
1124363 youll never play for england because youre too small and not strong enough
1124364 demanded that the company immediately cease all marketing and sales of meth coffee in the state of illinois citing the devastating impact that methamphetamine has had in communities in illinois
1124365 significant resources have been devoted to combating the methamphetamine epidemic in our state and we are deeply concerned that your marketing of meth coffee will perpetuate the use of this devastating drug
1124366 remember when you were small and had invisible friends i had invisible enemies
1124367 people are getting their understanding of the world from random lunatics riffing in their underwear rather than professional journalists with standards and passports
1124368 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1124369 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1124370 this is something that is very true in my clinical experience
1124371 the uninsured cant get in to see the doctor they miss medications their blood pressure is out of control and really you see devastating consequences
1124372 these people are going to end up with complications of their illnesses prematurely they will be disabled early they will probably die younger it is a major public health disaster
1124373 longer term there will be expensive admissions to hospitals usually through the emergency department due to diabetes out of control and congestive heart failure because of hypertension
1124374 we found some pretty striking differences when we compared uninsured individuals with one of these seven conditions with insured individuals with one of the conditions
1124375 these are conditions that we take care of in the clinic we know that we can prevent disabling complications or catastrophe if we are able to manage these conditions
1124376 it is interesting that chronic conditions are more common among people with insurance than without but that isnt surprising either people with a chronic condition are likely to place a higher value on their coverage and work harder to get and keep it
1124377 but having insurance is not likely to prove to be a panacea for these folks
1124378 people with chronic conditions who are insured are not doing so well either we do not do a very good job of delivering chronic care in this country for anyone
1124379 beneath the hooves of the giraffes and zebras populating the idyllic sceneries around lake naivasha lies the
1124380 were at a real turning point in kenya its a choice between a clean energy policy with low carbon emissions and the path of fossil energy which may be more simple and require less investments but is infinitely more polluting
1124381 my wildcatters have been drilling lately in the detroit formation making efficient cars is equivalent to finding an all american saudi arabia under detroit
1124382 our updated supply demand data suggest that the u s ethanol market is now in oversupply and will likely remain in that condition until demand catches up with available supplies in late 2009
1124383 this suggests ethanol production margins will face increasing downward pressure and the producers earnings will be negligible additionally cash flow concerns will continue
1124384 ethanol is an attractive low cost gasoline additive for petroleum refiners and blenders
1124385 but with most of the major metropolitan centers already blending ethanol and the midwest approaching saturation future consumption growth will have to come from smaller coastal markets which will take time
1124386 its all about the same beats that we inherited from africa its that same common denominator that brought the samba to brazil and brought jazz to america
1124387 its just like narcotics who is responsible the drug baron or the junkies
1124388 climate policies which would make the developed world responsible for chinas export emissions have both benefits and costs and must be carefully designed to achieve political consensus and equity whoever is responsible for these emissions chinas rapidly expanding infrastructure and inefficient coal powered electricity system need urgent attention
1124389 in some measure it makes sense if people buy goods and become liable for the emissions generated when the goods are produced they will certainly be more choosy about what they buy
1124390 there are rich pickings for those prepared to expand their horizons and take on the challenges with traditional markets shrinking trade with south east asia isnt just an option its a necessity
1124391 at the time my greatest aspiration was to go home and work in local news in chicago
1124392 certainly i didnt think of anything like cnbc or cnn cable news was really just getting started
1124393 theyd say this has nothing to do with me or i dont know enough about this
1124394 they did not seem to be very involved politically at all
1124395 if kids dont have the information lets get it to them
1124396 i was part of the process during that part of my life civil rights anti war protests
1124397 this is their country and this is their future we just want them to participate
1124398 that was important to me that we open up a dialogue so that people leave talking about what affects them
1124399 unless youre really poor or have a decent job or are a child you wont be covered they absolutely dont understand the consequences
1124400 theyve had them before and theyd either expire or dont get renewed by the judge
1124401 this is a long ongoing property dispute between the two and it has been in the courts for a long time
1124402 the york police have had to respond to this location many times
1124403 we are looking for some resolution out of this that both parties can peacefully be together
1124404 until the end of his days he fought for russia not only to move away from its totalitarian past but also to have a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country we owe him a lot
1124405 he was one of the first people who spoke up about the inhumanity of stalins regime with a full voice and about the people who lived through this but were not broken
1124406 for a country to have a great writer is like having another government thats why no regime has ever loved great writers only minor ones
1124407 i came with a very sad dark idea of the country
1124408 the molecular interaction in oxygen revealed by this study is due to the unique fact that oxygens outmost orbital is half filled with two unpaired electrons
1124409 as the molecules are squeezed into smaller volumes at high pressure electrons in the orbital inevitably move about trying to pair with electrons in the neighboring molecules
1124410 the behavior of oxygen at high pressure demonstrates one of the most profound effects of pressure on matter which transforms the colorless air we breath into colorful dense solids
1124411 the drastic change in the appearance of this familiar gas is due to the bonding changes in oxygen induced by high pressure
1124412 this is the first demonstration of how new tools can be used to probe the subtle interactions between atoms and molecules that lead to the formation of entirely new crystal structures
1124413 these new structures may give rise to entirely new electronic magnetic and other physical properties that could lead to new technologies
1124414 it is exciting to find that oxygen forms molecular clusters under high pressure through similar mechanism and this opens a possibility for new forms of materials at high pressure with potential for technical applications
1124415 when you have divided party government you have more vigorous oversight
1124416 to assess the oversight of one year can take several years
1124417 it would be wrong to ascribe these accomplishments to the congressional hearings but without question those hearings in 1994 had a galvanizing effect
1124418 one thing that is clear is that there is a heckuva lot more oversight than there was before 2006
1124419 why the swearing in ceremony at the state house at night you have to acknowledge that you have a problem
1124420 in the last three or four months the momentum has really built up for more spending
1124421 congress has moved a whole range of bills that take the problem up another notch
1124422 well below the record deficit of all time which was 6 percent of gdp back in 1983
1124423 the important point to remember is that near term deficits are both temporary and manageable if and only if we keep spending in check the tax burden low and the economy growing
1124424 excessive spending beyond the presidents budget plan will make the problem worse
1124425 mr bush came to office with the biggest surpluses in history and he will leave office with the biggest deficits in history thats the bottom line
1124426 getting the economy back on track was a higher priority than immediate deficit reduction
1124427 this is a war not only against the us but against our way of freedom
1124428 we have been fighting for over 16 years against islamic extremism it is also my war
1124429 weve received numerous reports from combatant commanders on the effectiveness of the 09 limas versus the private contract linguists and demand is extremely high
1124430 we have to make some breakthroughs on how we assign trust assess and utilize those who have direct contact with foreign entities
1124431 that unfolding story carries a lot of implications with it and its a huge cultural shift for the entire nation
1124432 they hear things that are said around them they are able to see things that others cant see
1124433 he was pretty much giving an order to have the commander killed
1124434 right there a life was saved you can see just by knowing a bit of slang being a native speaker it can make a difference
1124435 our integration of arrays of nanowires that perform separate functions and are made of heterogeneous substances and doing this in a way that can be reproduced on a large scale in a controlled way is a first
1124436 our main objective is a route toward integrated nanowire arrays that we can produce on any substrate even paper and to reproduce them uniformly on a large scale
1124437 to do that over the past two years our group has developed methods of printing nanowire arrays after first growing the nanowires on a donor substrate we transfer them to any desired substrate including paper or plastic
1124438 nanowires grow sticking out in random directions they look like a bad hair day
1124439 is like combing the hair to make it stand up straight
1124440 to fabricate the integrated circuitry we had to position the two kinds of materials at precise locations on the receiver substrate
1124441 the pattern for the device was on a photoresist layer coated on the substrate first we printed the cadmium selenide nanowires onto the substrate then removed the photoresist with acetone leaving the cadmium selenide nanowires exactly where we wanted them we repeated the process for the germanium silicon nanowires
1124442 in the future we can foresee using a variety of different optical sensors to create nanoscale devices sensitive to multiple colors in high resolution
1124443 and thats just the beginning we contemplate printing nanowire sensor circuitry photosensors chemical sensors biosensors not on silicon but on paper or plastic tape this could be used easily and with instant results where spills have occurred or to test air quality or to test for disease organisms almost any use for a sensor that you can imagine
1124444 large scale heterogeneous integration of nanowire arrays for image sensor circuitry
1124445 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1124446 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1124447 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed

1124452 frost amp sullivan expects small scale deployments to occur during the second half of 2009 by a few tier one mobile operators and based on the results of the 2009 launch other mobile operators will decide if they need to choose a similar path in the years to come
1124453 history has shown that for the success of any new technology standards based products available at affordable costs are a high requisite
1124454 if the femtocell forum along with the 3gpp ecosystem delays considerably in achieving these objectives then the industry will correlate the hype and expectation that a few other technologies have generated over the years for example 3g and dare i say mobile wimax to femtocells as well

1124462 blades have developed into a mature technology in the data centre
1124463 at the same time the improvements in features and functions combo solutions including servers and storage as well as improvements in the software stack drive the blade proposition further downstream making it increasingly viable for smbs

1124477 we have made some concessions including agreeing to postpone the elections and we have shown flexibility on this
1124478 we want to see the final version of the u n proposal we want to make sure that there is no reference to the referendum in it
1124479 have not shown any flexibility and they are not interested in reaching any deals

1124484 the key finding here is that this is ascorbic acid used as a drug and it appears to have some promise in treating some cancers
1124485 that hydrogen peroxide leads to death of some cancer cells and does not seem to kill normal cells why that is we dont know
1124486 the thing thats realistic here is that the concentrations that are effective or similar concentrations can be achieved in humans
1124487 i think were pretty close to being ready to do that

1124925 today it is generally agreed that a business is not serious if it does not have a website people look to websites to find out more about businesses see how the company presents itself and what are the services that company provides people also want to be assured that the business has other satisfied customers by viewing client lists and testimonials
1124926 being an investor in the age of the internet is a cinch if you are an investor either private or institutional and come across a company that could be an attractive investment one of the first and easiest things you can do aside from calling his broker is to navigate to the main page on your favorite search engine type in the name of the company in the search field and then log on to its website if it has one when you gets there you should find all the details he need the companys line of business who its ceo is how he or she got the job the companys revenue and profit for the latest quarter who sits on its board who are the analysts covering it and how to get in touch with them
1124927 i grew up there and left when i was 15 for saskatoon for junior hockey
1124928 my mom and dad and my wifes mom still live in hudson bay
1124929 i had a hockey school there for about 15 years and i got to go back and kill two birds with one stone
1124930 i had other opportunities before the sharks after i was let go but i elected to stay with my family and get some rest and relaxation
1124931 ive been home the last couple of seasons and i think they want to see me back on the road
1124932 i was glad to be given the opportunity its one of the elite teams in the league the team is big and strong with a lot of speed
1124933 well need them playing more as a team instead of relying on individuals to get us over the top
1124934 ill be with the defensemen and have a little say in the penalty kill
1124935 knowing doug and wife kathy theyve always been first class
1124936 doug and i were teammates and he went into the management side and i went to coaching in the minors he and some other players showed me the ropes and how to be a pro if i had a question i could always ask doug
1124937 todd and i coached against each other in the minors and when he won the calder cup they beat us
1124938 todd was always a bright hockey mind and its not surprising to see where he ended up
1124939 its having a relationship with people and getting them to do what they dont want to do in order to become what they want to become
1124940 i scouted for a year but ultimately i missed the competitiveness
1124941 as a coach youre as close to being a player as you can be
1124942 if you look at the history the teams that have won the cup have one to two studs on the blueline
1124943 blake and boyle have won and they will be able to help out the other five
1124944 integrated visibility and control over the movement of inventory and assets across todays complex global supply networks can be slow costly and very challenging in the past inventory and the assets used to ship them were tracked in two separate systems which made closed loop tracking of assets very difficult with the new release customers can manage this combined movement through a single process driving greater efficiency improved visibility and stronger control over supply chain operations
1124945 being able to manage inventory and assets in a single system provides inherent efficiencies there are significant costs tied up in reusable assets used in distribution operations it makes sense to track these along with the inventory they transport for a complete view of the supply chain in motion
1124946 i was a minor league hockey player who never played in the nhl
1124947 my dream was to get to the nhl and three years ago i got there i loved my career in the minors and made great friends but i always wanted to get to the highest level
1124948 i count my blessings that im working in hockey at the highest level
1124949 we had good teams three years in a row we suffered a first round loss to edmonton then we went a little further and lost a tough six game series to anaheim it was a great feeling the third year
1124950 it was a very inclusive staff in detroit with some really good hockey minds
1124951 i felt every day i went to work i would learn i cant wait to get started here i feel very fortunate to be included on this staff
1124952 especially for a guy who grew up in toronto probably the premier hockey market
1124953 i dont think you could find two more different places than toronto and huntsville toronto is the economic financial and cultural center of canada and i went to the deep south i met a lot of nice people there
1124954 i would say my best experience playing and personally was in europe
1124955 in germany i played in a town called stuttgart and it was the motor city of the country it was a beautiful city and my wife and i grew up so much culturally the ice hockey was very underrated there was a lot of pressure on import players to perform and i think i had my best year there as a pro
1124956 i grew up one of three boys and we all make our living from the game
1124957 my oldest brother operates the hockey school we started and my other brother worked for the wild and now the capitals our parents were very supportive we are a true hockey family in every sense
1124958 ill be flying back to toronto on august 29 for my day with the cup

1124969 how many words beginning with a w can you use in a sentence
1124970 the lack of adequate hostel provision and the shocking increase in waiting lists for social housing reflect the failure of the state to understand this complex problem it is alarming that the most vulnerable women are faced with the unenviable choice of squatting sleeping rough or relying on family or friends for accommodation a big part of this problem stems from labours failure to build enough housing in every category over the last decade
1124971 this report underestimates the true numbers because it only includes those accepted by councils as a priority many vulnerable women escaping domestic violence lie low and stay away from councils altogether so are not counted those who ask for help are not always accepted as a priority and dont make any lists this is a largely hidden problem which these numbers only touch upon
1124972 councils have to take more responsibility for these vulnerable people yes we need more houses but the government has to be more creative with the private sector if we are ever going to meet housing needs
1124973 it has been virtually impossible for councils to build new homes because they cant borrow money on the open market
1124974 last year was the first time since 1983 that we built more social houses than were lost through right to buy our recent housing bill and the creation of the homes and communities agency will help to deliver council homes more quickly and will make it easier for councils to build their own social housing to meet the needs

1125023 homosexuality is regarded as shameful by barbarians and by those who live under despotic governments just as philosophy is regarded as shameful by them because it is apparently not in the interest of such rulers to have great ideas engendered in their subjects or powerful friendships or passionate love all of which homosexuality is particularly apt to produce
1125024 public culture of these centuries was male oriented and the apposite intellectual and indeed effective partner to a male was another male in this all male society the beauty of the male youth was perhaps the key symbol and organising centre for adult male eroticism
1125025 genuine love has no connection whatsoever with the womens quarters i deny that it is love that you have felt for women and girls any more than flies feel love for milk or bees for honey but that other lax and housebound love that spends its time in the bosoms and beds of women ever pursuing a soft life innovated amid pleasure devoid of manliness and friendship and inspiration it should be proscribed
1125026 to be in love with those who are beautiful and chaste is the experience of a kind hearted and generous soul but to hire for money and to indulge in licentiousness is the act of a man who is wanton and ill bred
1125027 there was no word in classical biblical or patristic greek with the same meaning as the english word homosexual there appears to be no consciousness of a dichotomy such as the modern homosexual versus heterosexual there were names however for persons who practised homosexual activity these included for example paiderast s pallakos kinaidos arrenoman s and paidophthoros
1125028 do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes malakoi nor homosexual offenders arsenokoitai nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of god
1125029 thinks the base pederastic love seeks a person who is malthakon plato phaedrus 239c where malthakon is a poetic form of malakos and the speaker in the er tikus plutarch er tikus 751d speaks of the willing youth consenting to pederastic intercourse as one who acts with malakia
1125030 we also know that law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels the ungodly and sinful the unholy and irreligious for those who kill their fathers or mothers for murderers for adulterers and perverts arsenokoitai for slave traders and liars and perjurers and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which he entrusted to me
1125031 do not steal seeds whoever takes for himself is accursed to generations of generations to the scattering of life do not arsenokoit s do not betray information do not murder give one who has laboured his wage do not oppress a poor man
1125032 and let the murderer know that the punishment he has earned awaits him in double measure after he leaves this world so also the poisoner sorcerer robber swindler and arsenokoit s the thief and all of this band
1125033 i am not claiming to know what arsenokoit s meant i am claiming that no one knows what it meant i freely admit that it could have been taken as a reference to homosexual sex but given the scarcity of evidence and the several contexts just analyzed in which arsenokoit s appears to refer to some particular kind of economic exploitation no one should be allowed to get away with claiming that of course the term refers to men who have sex with other men it is certainly possible i think probable that arsenokoit s referred to a particular role of exploiting others by means of sex perhaps but not necessarily by homosexual sex the more important question i think is why some scholars are certain it refers to simple male male sex in the face of evidence to the contrary perhaps ideology has been more important than philology
1125034 innovations have been few and far between traffic has been tepid and retailers have seen flat sales overall
1125035 category expansion allows merchants to bid on more granular product areas in addition to broad categories
1125036 the effects of the fee change on pricing might depend on the merchant because we are adding more categories its hard to say whether there will be an up or down effect on pricing some categories will cost more some less we are giving merchants the ability to tailor their campaigns to the categories they make the most money on roi should go up

1125044 todos sabemos que muchas de las leyes estaban a la espera de la propuesta de reforma constitucional y tuvimos que sentarnos a reformular las leyes de manera tal que se mantuvieran dentro del texto constitucional vigente
1125045 una ley no puede ser promulgada en secreto tiene que ser conocida antes de su entrada en vigencia y debe ser debatida tanto por la opini n p blica y por el parlamento
1125046 la reiteraci n de casos como el de la congresista sucari es una fatalidad de la cual el congreso tiene que sacudirse

1125099 the key finding here is that this is ascorbic acid used as a drug and it appears to have some promise in treating some cancers
1125100 we carefully reviewed the available evidence to measure the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer and could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1125101 at this point we recommend that men concerned about prostate cancer talk with their health care providers to make a decision based on their individual risk factors and personal preference

1125322 epidemiologic observations of sex differences in the onset and course of schizophrenia prompted exploration of estrogens role in schizophrenia
1125323 estrogens neuroprotective and psychoprotective actions may be mediated by a variety of routes ranging from rapid actions including antioxidant effects and enhancement of cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose utilization to slower genomic mechanisms which may include permanent modification of neural circuits
1125324 the lack of effect for negative symptoms is consistent with literature reporting that negative symptoms are less responsive to treatment than other symptoms of schizophrenia it is possible that longer term treatment is required for negative symptoms to respond to treatment alternatively brain regions implicated in negative symptoms may be less responsive to gonadal hormone effects
1125325 estrogen treatment is a promising new area for future treatment of schizophrenia and potentially for other severe mental illnesses

1125329 iupui has a brand new emergency preparedness program and has a fully developed campus wide plan for emergency evacuation the emhe grant will finance the creation of other campus wide emergency plans and additional planning efforts that will increase iupuis capabilities to prepare for respond to and recover from any type of man made or naturally caused disaster
1125330 the challenge of this grant is that all projects are expected to encompass the full grant term of 18 months so all will be run concurrently
1125331 in emergency management there are many no 1 priorities and we are accustomed to multi tasking to achieve all objectives that will raise our level of preparedness
1125332 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1125333 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1125334 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people
1125335 for decades the medial temporal lobe structures have been linked to both memory and spatial cognition
1125336 so we set out to test how these two abilities related to one another and to the temporal lobe area of the brain
1125337 we concluded that the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are not essential for path integration since we showed that the tests could be successfully accomplished despite damage to these brain regions
1125338 were small and were best explained by common genetic factors with opposite effects on exercise behavior and symptoms of anxiety and depression
1125339 in genetically identical twin pairs the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the co twin who exercised less
1125340 it is unknown which genes might be involved in voluntary exercise behavior and in the risk for anxiety and depression
1125341 only voluntary leisure time exercise is influenced by genetic factors whereas the other type of exercise directed and monitored by someone else is environment driven the absence of causal effects of voluntary exercise on symptoms of anxiety and depression does not imply that manipulation of exercise cannot be used to change such symptoms
1125342 the antidepressant effects of exercise may only occur if the exercise is monitored and part of a therapeutic program
1125343 yet despite the traditional prominence of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice and training there are indications of a recent decline in the provision of psychotherapy by u s psychiatrists a trend attributed to reimbursement policies favoring brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapy and the introduction of newer psychotropic medications with fewer adverse effects
1125344 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
1125345 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
1125346 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
1125347 a key challenge facing the future generation of psychiatrists will likely involve maintaining their professional role as integrators of the biological and psychosocial perspectives while working within the constraints of the strong market forces of third party payers and managed care to implement advances in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders
1125348 because many prostate cancers grow slowly early detection may not benefit a patients health and in some cases may even cause harm
1125349 we encourage men younger than 75 to discuss with their clinicians the potential but uncertain benefits and the possible harms of getting the psa test before they decide to be screened
1125350 although the precise mechanisms are currently under investigation the association between short sleep duration and overweight may be attributed to the interaction of behavioral and biological changes as a result of sleep deprivation
1125351 given the fact that the prevalence of overweight among children and adolescents continues to increase and chronic sleep insufficiency becomes more prevalent in modern society family and school based sleep interventions that aim to enhance sleep hygiene and increase sleep duration may have important public health implications for the prevention and intervention of obesity and type 2 diabetes in children
1125352 furthermore our results demonstrate an important relationship between rem sleep and high bmi and obesity suggesting that the short sleep obesity association may be attributed to reduced rem sleep time and decreased activity during rem sleep

1125367 i never gave up in my life i am surely not going to give up now

1125378 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along

1125404 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1125405 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
1125406 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1125407 clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled in the case series ascorbate was given orally and intravenously but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally it was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti tumor effect

1125444 epidemiologic observations of sex differences in the onset and course of schizophrenia prompted exploration of estrogens role in schizophrenia
1125445 estrogens neuroprotective and psychoprotective actions may be mediated by a variety of routes ranging from rapid actions including antioxidant effects and enhancement of cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose utilization to slower genomic mechanisms which may include permanent modification of neural circuits
1125446 the lack of effect for negative symptoms is consistent with literature reporting that negative symptoms are less responsive to treatment than other symptoms of schizophrenia it is possible that longer term treatment is required for negative symptoms to respond to treatment alternatively brain regions implicated in negative symptoms may be less responsive to gonadal hormone effects

1125460 because of a dramatic increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity and diabetes mellitus during the past two decades physical activity has assumed an increasingly prominent role in disease prevention and health promotion efforts in the united states and is considered one of the 10 leading health indicators for the nation
1125461 it is important to know how patterns of physical activity inactivity and sedentary behaviors for this increasing segment of the population differ from those of the majority native population
1125462 physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors varied widely among children in various ethnic immigrant groups
1125463 for example 22 5 percent of immigrant hispanic children were physically inactive compared with 9 5 percent of u s born white children with u s born parents
1125464 they were however less likely to watch television three or more hours per day than native children although the nativity gap narrowed with increasing acculturation levels

1125471 this is one of the biggest questions that we get asked on election days
1125472 hes got a public record a well documented public record on positions that he took as a state lawmaker and as a result he feels an obligation to at least acknowledge those positions
1125473 not announce any positions on matters that might come before the court of appeals or lead voters to believe that i will decide any issues or cases in a predetermined manner
1125474 to fully and intelligently participate in the judicial election process
1125475 any of these candidates could eventually run for the supreme court and i hate to see them having to recuse
1125476 these days you never know exactly what issues might come before the court of appeals
1125477 theyre trying to flesh out the candidates positions on certain issues that perhaps are questions that might be more appropriate for a candidate for the executive or legislative branch
1125478 it is true that voters have difficulty getting useful information about judicial candidates
1125479 and it is true that all judges have predispositions that affect their decisions so the desire to hear judicial candidates expound upon their predispositions is understandable
1125480 judges duty to be fair and impartial requires them to be skeptical of their own predispositions not to point to those predispositions as qualifications for office
1125481 i understand why interest groups distribute their surveys to candidates
1125482 however i do not believe that it would be appropriate for me to respond to that questionnaire or similar questionnaires that ask for responses to hypothetical issues that may come before me as a judge
1125483 while the georgia court of appeals may not have jurisdiction over some of the issues raised
1125484 it is still possible that i might be asked to decide one of those issues if i sat by designation on the georgia supreme court when the issue arose or was faced with the issue as a member of that court if i later ran and was elected to it
1125485 i will take a look at it if they want to send it to me
1125486 its a balancing act because were going to be hearing cases with issues and i want to make sure i dont prejudge anything so im going to have to look at each one and take it as it comes
1125487 it gives you an indication of their judicial bent if theyre going to interpret strictly according to the rule of law or if theyre not
1125488 we try very hard not to ask questions that would be something that would be coming before them we try to make it questions that have already been decided in some form or fashion
1125489 if consummated dhl will become reliant for air transportation on one of its two major competitors
1125490 this raises the question if dhl will still be able to effectively compete against ups since ups will now have a large role in determining the cost and quality of dhls services
1125491 it is very clear to us this is not an antitrust matter
1125492 there is no partnership no joint venture no merger no acquisition
1125493 generally speaking the antitrust division can look at matters that affect competition

1125541 not only will this show off the power of xfce compared to windows but it will get the user accustomed to the idea that they can and should make changes to their computer to make it look and feel and act the way they want it to every time i see a default ubuntu desktop i see a failure to teach someone about linux
1125542 windows users are afraid of the command line and rightfully so its a scary place in windows if they think that they need the command line in linux then linux will scare them
1125543 i think they should be exposed to the terminal told what the command line equivalent is of any gui action a gui focused how to or help guide tells them to do and again encourage them to play around in it
1125544 making software free is what makes it work for them so it is important that they understand it
1125545 once the users understand the philosophy of open source they can understand the open source community and why support forums are often better than an 800 number
1125546 i think by far the easiest way to learn linux is to get together with others who know how to use linux
1125547 after the user is started its much easier to use help pages to get the rest of the way
1125548 seriously if one is technical and wants to learn linux i recommend buying one of many linux magazines they almost always have some distro cd with them in the stores then find an old machine around the house and install linux
1125549 i tend to favor the oreilly books consider starting with linux in a nutshell
1125550 start in the etc directory look at files ending in conf cfg rc look in the directory etc rc d init look at the startup scripts look in sbin and do man xxx on commands found there those are sysadmin commands youll learn about how to manage the system also look in usr sbin for some less pedantic admin commands
1125551 start ls ing in bin usr bin and usr local bin do man xxx on anything that piques your curiosity
1125552 if by now your curiosity isnt piqued stop youre not interested in linux
1125553 if this got you started i apologize in advance for taking up the next few years of your life
1125554 the first thing you need when learning linux is a solution
1125555 for me windows was bloated and the switch to linux served a purpose
1125556 id say the best way for a new user to get familiar with linux is to play with or install if a hard drives free one of the many excellent live cds available
1125557 you no longer need to understand your system to pick which distro would work the best since just about every distro works the same todays installers will not only set up a working system but actually migrate your settings from your former operating system so that you dont really even need to configure it
1125558 back in the day obtaining ice cream was a bit harder
1125559 you made a decision on what flavor you wanted gathered the ingredients for that flavor made the ice cream and picked how you wanted to serve it
1125560 when they bought the system of course it wasnt defined for a setup like a community clinic
1125561 so there was a lot of additional costs like programming
1125562 we deal with a lot of changes here with state federal and even county regulations so in order to keep up we needed something that could provide a faster turnaround to meet those changes
1125563 i explained to him what open source software was that the codes are free theyre easy to modify and things like that and he actually bought into it he was really surprised to hear about it and so he asked me is there an open source solution for healthcare administration so around 2003 i researched the idea
1125564 but we got grants for different projects like chronic disease management and we were often allowed to incorporate overhead costs into those budgets so we would use those extra monies to develop the clearhealth system
1125565 operation samahan is particularly important to clearhealth because its an fqhc
1125566 they are representative of organizations with fewer resources that are generally on the front lines of the chronic disease crisis in this country their frugality is a good driver of efficiencies and innovations that have impacted the clearhealth system the proprietary systems out there typically focus on features to sell the software and keep organizations from being able to move or interoperate to support their lock in models working with samahan naturally led us to a model that builds features based on tangible benefits in real settings rather than just eye candy in a sales brochure
1125567 as the beta testers whatever clearhealth developed with other clinics was incorporated into our system as well the whole development project cost about 200 000 in total and we didnt have to contribute a penny were getting all these enhancements for free and as part of the deal i helped them start up certain features
1125568 we were able to cope with all the standard changes in billing really easily
1125569 in the meantime we had all these complaints from other clinics who were saying oh my gosh we havent gotten paid in six months because our software vendors are very slow in keeping up with these changes we were so glad that we got out of that system
1125570 were already in the thick of developing the emr side into our system you cant find any system right now at this cost that can give you full emr capability as well as pms so what will happen with these clinics that have only pms on proprietary software is that theyll have to ditch whatever they have now and move to a new system so its more expensive
1125571 were actually in the process of establishing a separate entity of operation samahan that will offer technical services to other clinics
1125572 in fact were already supporting another clinic thats twice our size for their technical needs with my knowledge of megawest i can help them but theyre on the verge of changing their system and theyre looking very hard at their options are they going to a proprietary system that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars we can help them compare the system we have and with all these features to a proprietary system thats five times the cost just to acquire it
1125573 were getting a one week turnaround with our claims now with megawest we would see a two to three week turnaround community clinics dont have that big reserve and one week of delayed payments can cripple your company because thats your bottom line
1125574 at some point the staff were reluctant but then they saw the system
1125575 megawest is actually text based so its all command line driven so i had older staff members who werent very familiar with the mouse and they were saying well i dont know how to use this because its all a graphical interface its not so much open source or proprietary because they dont really know the difference they just see whats on the screen when i showed them clearhealth which is web based the younger staff got it it was zero training for them because theyre very familiar with the internet with the older staff it was just a matter of getting used to the mouse
1125576 i hear you and your band are trading in your guitars and buying turntables

1125579 a study conducted in late 2007 by id analytics which offers identity intelligence on demand found that from three to 36 percent of identities stolen by internal data thieves were misused
1125580 compared to that only 0 01 to 0 5 percent of identities stolen in external data breaches was misused
1125581 there is place for both open source and proprietary in any sme environment its really about the right tools for the job
1125582 for example in a desktop environment in which users just need a simple web interface basic word processing and a spreadsheet an open source package such as ubuntu running openoffice would be perfect these users dont need the bells and whistles of a microsoft office
1125583 absolutely the way to go open source allows for rapid change customisation and greater flexibility
1125584 sme versions of heavyweight proprietary solutions generally offer fewer features than their big brother counterparts which is why they are more affordable for the sme but what if the particular whistle that has been left out is one the sme needs and what if there are still features in the lite version that the sme can easily do without
1125585 with an open source option smes can have a solution that not only fits their precise needs it will be easy to scale as the business grows

1125601 there are a large number of left leaning religious and political organisations that are active these days offering an alternative to the religious right
1125602 a liberal theological perspective involves less traditional views of the divine spirituality and religious authority
1125603 the core of the religious left consists of people who are liberal in both their theology and their political outlook a pattern commonly associated with the term progressive
1125604 another important sub group consists of those who have a conservative theological perspective but liberal views on political issues
1125605 the annunciation of a religious left like the heralding of the religious rights demise has become a growth industry
1125606 it will not succeed for one simple reason the religious left is really a political agenda speaking to christians just as the religious right are religious people influencing politics
1125607 the religious left is nothing but repackaging of politics for non doctrinaire spiritualists it is not a genuine appeal to people of faith

1125777 im taking no chances and after the enjoyable euro finals i can look back upon my decision with a good feeling
1125778 i had a comprehensive conversation with ruud and i can do nothing else but respect his decision
1125779 i regret it that i cant use his quality and experience when i compose my squad but i wish him all the best at real madrid

1125791 when they said that he had taken crack and pcp and that he had voluntarily made that statement we knew that that was impossible from the evidence that had been put forth about how he had been tasered they put that out as a mechanism to cover up what really happened that he had been tasered to death
1125792 one of the coroners didnt even want to touch it he knew what the truth was but he didnt want to pronounce it as what it really was
1125793 cardiac arrest following nine 50 000 volt electroshock applications from a conductive electrical weapon

1125795 a lot of white people have come to me and said to keep on fighting dont let it go because it was wrong the way that things were handled on that day
1125796 it was a positive encouragement for people not to lay down and let you continue to do things to us anymore

1125845 saddened at the loss of life and injuries caused by the attack and extend our condolences to the victims and their families
1125846 especially in the vast countryside heavily populated by uighurs the has rolled out a political movement without end or reason that is unbearable to the uighur peasantry the entire uighur people live in a blanket state of fear
1125847 this time they actually managed to carry out their plan but it will not affect the
1125848 if every garage mechanic and driver knew the details and was involved in the planning of the attack it never would have happened
1125849 you must decide the weight and significance if any such statements deserve

1125851 y porque dicen frecuentemente muchos que lo experimentaron por si o lo oyeron de quienes lo experimentaron y de cuya fe no debe dudarse afirman haber o do que silvanos y faunos a quienes el vulgo denomina incubos han estado muchas veces con mujeres intentando y consumando coito con ellas

1125863 i dont think anyone has a greater right to be upset about this than me but let me tell you it is much more important that we focus on the goal we have to focus on putting this country back on track and electing sen barack obama as the next president of the united states
1125864 sen obama has looked at this issue he recognizes that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices and this is one occasion where we need to look at this strategically and he made the decision that we need to tap the strategic petroleum reserves
1125865 yes i did everything i could even the weirdest or the most lame to find someone but no i did not find anyone who met my expectations and with who i could get along

1125870 to doubt everything or to believe everything are two equally convenient solutions both dispense with the necessity of reflection
1125871 thats why i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
1125872 stated time and time again that roe was a bad decision

1125885 you know i was in this ambush the other day the captain said the enemy was coming along this road and what we should do was to hide in the grass on both sides of the road when the enemy came by wed stand up out of the grass like some fucking lions from africa or something and blast the shit out of them
1125886 yeah right only six of our guys died in friendly fire
1125887 inside the boardrooms at the major oil companies its christmas in july

1125889 they found the pups found the rendezvous site and trapped two animals possibly the alpha male and alpha female
1125890 they took hair samples and ear plugs and sent them to a lab to identify more concretely that they are 100 percent wolves not somebodys hybrid
1125891 this is the most exciting result its unexpected but exactly what we wanted
1125892 weve exceeded our wildest dreams to be helping photograph the first wolf pups in this area for a long time
1125893 they can be observed if they go to an area where they might be in trouble like hanging out next to a grazing area
1125894 trackers can observe monitor and find them again to put more collars on or take proactive means of avoiding conflict

1125896 you can argue that even a good part of lan infrastructure will be wireless eventually especially with mesh architectures but one thing that wi fi still doesnt achieve is gigabit speed throughput

1125905 dre and i have been developing these headphones for a while and in monster we found a partner that could work with us to crystallize his vision and develop them to the quality level he expects
1125906 beats by dr dre is yet another example of interscopes commitment to working together with its artists in developing new avenues to experience music

1125986 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1125987 there are some genuine ways in which we can provide some genuine relief to the high price in gas prices obama said today
1125988 i believe we should give every working family in america a 1 000 energy rebate and we should pay for it with part of the record profit that oil companies are making right now
1125989 no country for old men this man in this case
1125990 barr ella though neither one of them is likely to object if they escape this treatment
1125991 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1125992 the truth is none of these steps will come close to seriously reducing our energy dependence in the long term
1125993 we need a much bolder and much bigger set of solutions
1125994 obama believes that the doubling of oil prices in the past year is crisis for millions of americans
1125995 and the transfer of wealth to oil producing countries many of them hostile to our interests is a threat to our national security
1125996 in 2005 for example obama suggested that the president should use that authority to release oil only in the case of a
1125997 i do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said that we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency you have a situation lets say where there was a major oil facility in saudi arabia that was destroyed as a consequence of terrorist acts and you suddenly had huge amounts of oil taken out of the world market we wouldnt just be seeing 4 a gallon oil we could see a situation where entire sectors of the country had no oil to function at all and thats what the strategic oil reserve has to be for
1125998 the doubling of oil prices in the past year is crisis for millions of americans
1125999 and the transfer of wealth to oil producing countries many of them hostile to our interests is a threat to our national security
1126000 i cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who most need tax relief
1126001 i just thought it was too tilted to the wealthy and i still do
1126002 if his original proposal came to a vote on the senate floor he would not vote for it

1126004 im the only one that said that rumsfeld had to go
1126005 against a bill that would require the central intelligence agency to abide by the restrictions on interrogating prisoners outlined in the army field manual
1126006 what heartens me as i hear the speeches of the men and women gathered around me is that i know in my heart we are speaking and giving voice to the will of the overwhelming majority of the american people who want this congress to return to washington d c and give the american people more access to american oil
1126007 im absolutely confident that if this congress were brought back to washington d c and given an opportunity to vote on giving more access to the american people of american oil that there is a bipartisan majority in the congress that would pass that measure
1126008 democrats offered a real solution to high energy prices that would bring immediate relief within 10 days by forcing the president to free our oil from the nations stockpile
1126009 the republicans propose to give away public lands to big oil which will not immediately reduce the price at the pump and save americans only 2 cents 10 years from now this republican hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to reduce the price at the pump and promote energy independence
1126010 in my district youll see a lot of wind turbines
1126011 youll see a lot of activities in labs for research and development of biodiesel and other renewables and alternatives its poised to be one of the leading districts in the nation on renewables
1126012 but what youll also see is a lot of oil and gas activity especially in weld county where theres great agriculture going on and yet a lot of exploration
1126013 meanwhile most of their republican colleagues returned home burdened with trying to explain why they blocked efforts to combat high gas prices
1126014 republicans voted against expanding drilling in alaska against promoting renewable energy against establishing the first new vehicle efficiency standards in 32 years against repealing taxpayer subsidies for major oil companies that are making record profits against cracking down on price gouging and against curbing excessive speculation in energy markets
1126015 for six years republicans controlled every branch of government and did nothing while america became more dependent on foreign sources of oil
1126016 i loaded up the minivan with our four children just like the griswolds and we drove through the night
1126017 you sense the change that is happening in the debate
1126018 you sense the change that the presumptive nominee of the democratic party senator obama is beginning to see the light on this and we welcome him to see the light on this
1126019 i think if we can continue to push continue to push continue to push then ultimately the american people are going to be winners

1126071 interesting analysis although im not sure these numbers revenue per employeee really surprise nor are meaningful when you take into account the differences in the business models between lvlt which has a relatively small number of customers who each generate relatively large amounts of traffic revenue compared to t and vz who both derive signifcant revenue streams from many many customers who individually generate comparatively little traffic revenues and require lots of hand holding think of all the folks working down at your local verizon wireless or at amp t store working to support your 100 a month wireless bill and your kids 5 99 a month unlimited text package because lvlt has the vast majority of its business in wholesale markets voice transport cdn ip one would expect their revenue per employee to be higher than t and vz and suggesting that a measure like this represents a valid measure of managerial effectiveness is superficial

1126100 there isnt a single person alive today who can say theyve seen a real estate market exactly like this a lot of us have our battle scars from previous market downturns but no one has seen anything like this
1126101 i am a firm believer that historic times such as the ones we are currently experiencing provide for historic opportunities
1126102 i dont think that its any exaggeration to say that the real estate industry and its practitioners are for the most part resistant to change historically the mentality of the industry as a whole has been if its not broke dont fix it well for those of us who are still standing i think we can finally admit out loud that the industry is broke and now is the time to fix it
1126103 it is my total belief that with exception of one main hub of operations monolithic offices with a desk for every agent are a thing of the past most of the time these behemoths with their giant overhead and utility bills sit empty in todays market with the technologies and efficiencies that are so readily available the successful offices that are emerging are the high tech high traffic models that we are currently implementing throughout our organization
1126104 in 2004 we took an unused cloak closet in the tour lobby of the desert springs j w marriott resort and spa and turned it into the least expensive and most productive office in our system more than 700 000 people pass by our front door every year at this one location alone
1126105 our lifestyle locations take advantage of the surrounding amenities to augment the modest dimensions of the office we have a limited number of unassigned desks that our agents are able to use while they are in the office but our concept is why sign contracts in a boring conference room when you and your clients could be doing the same by the crystal blue pool or on the patio of a quaint caf on site these locations are enjoyable for our clients and our agents alike
1126106 by implementing the latest technologies we are able to run more efficiently than we could have every imagined
1126107 if youve never heard of i chat you are missing huge opportunities
1126108 this amazing tool allows our staff and any member of our management team including myself to be instantaneously face to face accessible to any of our agents from anywhere in the world instead of grappling with the sky rocketing price of fuel we have virtually eliminated travel expenses and by cutting down travel time we are enjoying increased productivity in addition weve also centralized our highly skilled corporate professionals and therefore we are no longer saddled with a redundancy in staffing
1126109 the folks at apple are geniuses and we have completely gravitated to the use of their product platform throughout our company from i phones to the latest in desktop computers each piece of equipment plays an important roll in helping further this new office model there is even a software that allows an apple computer to run antiquated mls programs as if they were being run on a pc
1126110 although in some cases it takes a lot of reassuring and hand holding once an agent gets comfortable with this new concept they truly begin to embrace a different work style many of our agents who were skeptical about this concept have commented to me that this environment has made them more efficient and effective and that they cant imagine going back to their previous way of doing business
1126111 i have both seasoned and newer agents coming to me every day with these blank expressions on their faces and questions in their eyes and they are looking to me for some type of advice or direction or motivation to keep pushing forward as the broker i look at it as my duty and responsibility to provide sound counsel and advice but since no one has a clear understanding of where this market will be tomorrow i know that i have to come up with something that could be acted upon today
1126112 in january 1993 in the midst of another challenging real estate market i was part of a group of agents who banded together to help our clients unlock their frozen equity and make successful transactions by executing real estate trades fifteen years later we dusted off the program and opened it up to the entire industry there are currently approximately 100 properties displayed on the website of owners who would consider a trade for their property also since it started in february the program has been instrumental in the helping orchestrate more than 40 trades the most noteworthy being a 7 750 000 custom home in rancho santa fe being successfully traded for a 2 500 000 english tudor style home in la costa
1126113 we have developed a proprietary communication system that is becoming one of the most powerful listing and retention tools anyone has ever seen
1126114 weve been in the development stages of the dyson dashboard for a couple of years now and we are getting ready to roll it out to our agents in the next few months the dashboard is a sophisticated paperless communication documentation listing maintenance scheduling reporting databasing and marketing system that will become an interactive part of our agents everyday lives we are working the bugs out of the system during beta trials but those who are currently testing it are giving the dashboard high marks
1126115 for the next few years i see brokerages continue in some traditional residential listings and sales but i think there are many tremendous opportunities in foreclosures property management investments and bulk sales i also see brokerages creating strategic relationships with various groups and organizations
1126116 in a lot of cases when a brokerage becomes a member of a network it means they might change their logo and their letterhead and answer the phone with a different greeting but outside of the basic cosmetic changes and attending the occasional brand convention the broker and their agents make no real effort to explore the opportunities available within their own network through our connection with the sothebys international realty network of brokers we are finding it advantageous to reach out to other agents and brokers to create an international agent and broker marketing network program we are currently in dialogue with the management and marketing teams within the sothebys international realty network about this program that is designed to have agents promote each others listings around the world and implement international cooperative property advertising and distribution that will allow for global exposure of our clients properties at a minimal expense
1126117 someone recently read me a quote that said that our finest moments are most likely to come about when we are experiencing great discomfort it is when we are uncomfortable or unhappy with our current situation that we are most open to change i dont think im alone in saying that in all my years in the real estate industry i cant ever remember being this uncomfortable and because of my discomfort im ready for a change and i think many more in the industry are ready too
1126118 even if we are not at the bottom and if you intend to hold for at least two years a property that you buy at great value today you will hit an absolute homerun
1126119 when you sell your home are you moving up in price down in price or out of the area

1126209 on june 7th as you know jessie was taken by death eaters and they took her to america so the ministry couldnt find them they met up with two people there who turned out to be vampires they saved her life by biting her but it changed her they where blood thirsty creatures like i was once who didnt care who they bit as long as they had their food and got to torture people they renamed jessie jemini or jem for short that night they went out hunting the older female vampire saw a girl jessies age across the street and decided she wanted her jessie then said shed get the girl so wandered across the road and lead the girl into the waiting teeth of the vampire the girl was katie snape

1126238 in most cases the cell phone was purchased to be reachable when mobile so why are cell phone users unable to reach each other most of the time its very frustrating
1126239 were not saying that people should always answer their phones that would be unreasonable as there are numerous reasons when the phone should be turned off
1126240 but it should not be the exception to the rule when someone actually answers their cell phone

1126251 kata kacau balau dalam berita utama italia adalah kata yang tidak benar
1126252 saat ini adalah masa yang sulit tetapi kami tidak akan mendramatisir kami akan kembali ke jalur seperti biasanya
1126253 para pemain jangan disalahkan mereka akan melakukan yang terbaik mereka seperti saat mereka menang tetapi kami perlu melakukan perbuatan yang diperlukan jadi situasi ini akan berubah
1126254 bila anda seorang manajer anda perlu membuat keputusan bukan hanya memikirkan mereka
1126255 anda harus berpikir bagaimana memenangi pertandingan itu setiap pemain bagi saya sama semua bila kita ingin memenangi suatu pertandingan
1126256 kami sudah berbicara karena setiap pemain merasa kecewa khususnya gerrard karena pertandingan tersebut adalah pertandingan
1126257 setelah beberapa lama ia menyadari bahwa itu adalah suatu gagasan dan saya berfikir tentang yang terbaik bagi tim
1126258 anda tahu bila anda mengganti seorang pemain dia harus menunjukkan bahwa ia ingin bermain tetapi saya pikir ia pada akhirnya mengerti
1126259 banyak yang membicarakan bahwa madrid belum meyakinkan pada musim ini dan setiap orang tampaknya mencemaskan perubahan pelatih di musim panas ini dan tim bermain kurang meyakinkan
1126260 dengan pulihnya para pemain bintang seperti ronaldo rooney giggs dan tevez maka kami seperti memiliki amunisi penuh dalam pertandingan itu
1126261 pada awal musim ronaldo kena hukuman wayne rooney cedera sementara tevez dan anderson terlibat dalam kompetisi copa america kini kami sedang memiliki pemain terbaik yang siap beraksi
1126262 kendati kami dalam posisi kuat tetapi kami masih kehilangan scholes namun john o shea dan darren fletcher tampil lagi mereka pemain tangguh yang mengetahui apa artinya mengenakan kostum tim itu
1126263 kemudian pemain baru seperti anderson dan tevez juga tampil dan bermain dengan bagus
1126264 bagus sekali bila dapat memenangi pertandingan tandang dalam laga eropa
1126265 kemenangan ini membuat kami mengantungi sembilan poin dan kami dalam posisi amat kuat
1126266 saya kira permainan menyerang kami amat amat bagus dan seharusnya kami mendapatkan gol lebih
1126267 ada momentum pada babak kedua ketika dynamo membaik dan menyebabkan masalah bagi kami tapi saya kira itu hanya merupakan iklan bagus dalam kompetisi sepak bola eropa

1126281 im delighted to have this opportunity and help to continue guiding the hurricanes back in 2003 the goal was to build a competitive team and then build depth which we achieved we took another major step forward in 2008 when we selected a squad made up entirely of players from within the region and now i believe the franchise is in a great position to achieve our ultimate goal

1126290 ferocious belief that people have the power to transform their own lives which gave americans an unparalleled commitment to education hard work and economic freedom
1126291 happy era ended around 1970 when americas educational progress slowed to a crawl since then progress has been modest americas lead over its economic rivals has been entirely forfeited with many nations surging ahead in school attainment
1126292 the relatively few skilled workers command higher prices while the many unskilled ones have little bargaining power

1126307 but we have to do double duty theres no other choice
1126308 i couldnt bear the thought of getting more things to dust in our home
1126309 we thought the best thing we could do is to direct people to give in honor of our wedding
1126310 the only disappointing thing is that all of the people who donated to us were gay friends or couples
1126311 and so far none of our blood relatives or straight friends have actually contributed any money
1126312 we dont need another toaster or another set of silverware
1126313 so we thought wed have people who want to celebrate with a gift do that with these two institutions
1126314 i agree with the bible that homosexuality is wrong and i want to change
1126315 my sinful desires are so strong that i often have problems believing the bible when i struggle so hard with my own heart
1126316 i find most churches are more interested in programs and numbers than helping real people like me with a real problem
1126317 they are more quick to participate in some sort of legislative action against homosexuality rather than spend some time with me my friends in the gay community are always there for me
1126318 the church is the hope of the world and the church needs to get serious about reaching out to these people who struggle with homosexuality
1126319 the church doesnt need some special sort of learning or training to deal with the sin of homosexuality like any sin we all need and must have the help of christ to save us from our sins
1126320 we all deal with for as long as we are alive
1126321 it would be my hope that soon exodus would no longer be needed and the church could function well in ministry to homosexuals
1126322 churches are central to the healing of anyone not just the homosexual
1126323 we at exodus are committed to the restoration of lives built on the solid foundation of the bible and lived out in the church
1126324 a new family a whole new life and a chance to live again the way i am supposed to live
1126325 each week i go to listen to the preaching and learn about the bible

1126330 on the headcount reductions they have been coming down a few hundreds every quarter and similarly we saw a decrease again that much of a decrease by a few hundred its averaged anywhere from 3 to 415 in that range over the last couple of quarters
1126331 well as i said in my remarks that the q3 reductions will be a little less because while the headcount reductions and operating expense reductions will continue at the same pace we will see a seasonal pickup in utility bills as because of the summer temperatures the air conditioning loads in our data centers or co locations sites go up
1126332 were a little apprehensive since the last one was a hoax
1126333 well doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy
1126334 if we choose regulation over collaboration we will be setting a precedent by thrusting politicians and bureaucrats into engineering decisions another concern is that as an institution the fcc is incapable of deciding any issue in the nanoseconds that make up internet time and asking government to make these decisions could mean that every few years the ground rules would change based on election results the internet might grind to a halt in such a climate it would certainly die of clogged arteries if network owners had to seek government permission before serving their customers by managing surges of information flow
1126335 so it will be interesting whether the fcc bans network management which prohibits file sharing in which case cable and wireless networks could become congested to the annoyance of millions of ordinary users or whether it allows broadband providers to practice network management so long as they clearly disclose it in which case file sharers may discover they cant use a broadband wireless or cable connection to share files ever or maybe the brilliant politicians at the commission will require disclosure in sufficient detail to enable hackers to defeat network management altogether permitting congestion to reign but ensuring that providers not the commission will be blamed

1126345 given the fluid nature of things in the economy and the financial markets the directive isnt likely to provide any closure for those looking for a telltale hint on when the next policy move will occur it should convey the idea that the fed is still in a wait and see mode
1126346 most of the market volatility is the uncertainty of how to price assets as a result institutions are unwilling to loan money even for a short period of time because they dont know how to measure the quality of the assets being used as collateral consequently credit markets that normally provide liquidity to run a business dried up

1126358 the policy can no longer be blind to the green carbon thats in these natural forests he said

1126440 they dont see it they dont clean it because they dont realize the hazard is there
1126441 i wouldnt call it negligence im sure any company if they had an awareness that a hazard existed they would take corrective action so its really an ignorance issue
1126442 they look hard and creatively to identify sometimes arcane interpretations of rules that were broken were suggesting to osha that they dont offer clear guidance they dont tell industry the things to do to prevent a disaster like this
1126443 it takes a crisis to look inward and begin the self evaluation which would have raised awareness not only related to their environmental practices but in the socially equitable areas as well

1126453 why are the major corporations sponsoring the olympics some of the most recognizable brands in the world refusing to speak out against the worlds most wrenching humanitarian crisis
1126454 sponsors are supporting chinas efforts to position itself in glowing terms on the world stage
1126455 but they are silent about chinas role in the darfur genocide and in their silence they are complicit

1126491 they never gave her any of the proper medications for her aids diagnosis they did give her a prescription for a urinary tract infection but even then they filled her prescription with the wrong strength and they never diagnosed the meningitis even though she had been complaining about headaches sweats and generalized pain for weeks that is what killed her in the end
1126492 it was so advanced that it involved her brain her liver her lungs her heart and a couple of other organs she died in terrible pain
1126493 i told them i needed my medicine but they didnt give me anything
1126494 she told me after a month in detention that she still hadnt seen a doctor
1126495 i told her i could send her more medicine but she said they would not give it to her they were mostly giving her tylenol
1126496 he told me that victoria wasnt eating and was urinating blood but that the officials still were not paying her any mind
1126497 he told me get outside help but try not to worry
1126498 her foot was chained to the bed and when she tried to turn over it would hurt her
1126499 that made it twice as hard it was so humiliating no human should have to live their last days like that

1126515 most people understand that every woman has the right to choose what she does with her own body and that moral considerations about abortion are a very personal matter for individuals to decide
1126516 the legal precedent in canada is that abortion and those women who choose to have the medical procedure will not be criminalized
1126517 so every york student has the right to make up their own mind and there is no need for an event organized by anti choice campaigners that is disguised as a debate
1126518 they erected huge signs in full colour of fabricated fetuses alongside people dying in the holocaust and also pictures of people being lynched
1126519 so we set up a table outside of that display as the student union to encourage students to tell us what their reactions were so we could understand the effect it was having on students we collected hundreds of statements from students who said they were upset they were appalled they were traumatized and they were worried about the fact that the student union hadnt taken responsibility to actually interfere in the matter
1126520 just like we would not sanction the use of student space to challenge whether black students should be able to attend university or whether homosexuality should be illegal we would not sanction this particular debate over whether or not women should be able to have a choice concerning their own bodies
1126521 use the law as a foot in the door to recriminalize abortion via future measures
1126522 defamed me and my family because we follow and related to sic prophet muhammad
1126523 n obody ever thought the commissions would have anything to do with expressions of opinion or the dissemination of news reports that wasnt on the table
1126524 why im withdrawing my human rights complaint against ezra levant
1126525 a blatant violation of democratic freedoms of speech and dissent
1126526 that universities are sites where discussions and debates about difficult geo political questions should be promoted not stifled
1126527 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small
1126528 and on the other side the risks are large and dramatic
1126529 we felt with sufficient certainty that your risk of being harmed exceeded your potential benefits starting at age 75
1126530 there is this idea that more is always better and if a test is available we should use it
1126531 a lot of time were doing more harm than good
1126532 its a disservice to patients a lot of men die from prostate cancer and theres just an overwhelming amount of evidence that screening saves lives
1126533 sent shock waves to every corner of the media landscape
1126534 the person who actually presses the button to make the recording supplies the necessary element of volition not the person who manufactures maintains or if distinct from the operator owns the machine
1126535 cablevision more closely resembles a store proprietor who charges customers to use a photocopier on his premises and it seems incorrect to say without more that such a proprietor makes any copies when his machines are actually operated by his customers
1126536 but i had also to survive because i was getting snow blind
1126537 we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they didnt trust it any more
1126538 my hands are fine while my feet are black from frostbite anyway i can walk and i want to descend to the base camp
1126539 i never gave up in my life i am surely not going to give up now

1126787 these topics range from the family to pollution poverty and the distribution of natural resources

1126796 there was some disruption and the street was blocked for some time
1126797 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite
1126798 his condition is not good he has some bruises and frostbite and exhaustion
1126799 if he is unable to get to advanced base camp tomorrow from where a helicopter can evacuate him then he might be sling lifted but this is a very technical operation and needs a lot of preparation

1126804 carried down both living and dead people from the mountain
1126805 they were far from me hours away but they were not turning around
1126806 but then i thought they know what they are doing
1126807 i would like to continue to rebuild my life and move forward leaving the past behind
1126808 its strange that esr has struck to their guns it may be for a variety of reasons
1126809 if you could show it was the negligence or improper procedures at esr that caused her to get the disease then theoretically you could sue esr
1126810 if you are not covered by acc you can still sue for damages
1126811 it would have been good if esr had accepted some form of responsibility early rather than denying the claim
1126812 many hundreds of thousands of dollars as she is a relatively young woman
1126813 given the latest developments in this case we will be approaching the appropriate government agencies to discuss payment
1126814 genuinely without any malice when she came out of a coma jeannette said she got it from the lab without a doubt of course she got it from the lab whats the probability of someone whos over 21 to get meningococcal disease from the community in three weeks when she lives by herself
1126815 she thinks she got it from the lab where else why were her colleagues vaccinated after she left if she didnt get it from the lab read between the lines
1126816 i think youve got to go for the fact that you actually handled the bacteria and caught it that way as opposed to you walking down willis st and maybe somebody by accident looked at you and you got the infection
1126817 a low risk is still a risk and given the devastation why does the report not clearly recommend the procedure of plating to be done in the biosafety cabinet if you think theres a potential risk from plating on the bench better be safe than sorry a low risk is the chance of losing your legs
1126818 no health and safety issues were identified suggesting that ms adu bobie may have acquired her illness at work with esr
1126819 we wouldnt put our staff into a situation where theres any chance of them contracting this disease if they follow standard operating procedures its a tragic coincidence that someone who has dedicated her life to finding solutions to this disease has actually been struck down by it
1126820 our belief is that it was contracted in the community
1126821 our investigations of the labs procedures and practices showed early on that it was extremely unlikely the infection was lab acquired and nothing we have heard or seen since has caused us to revise that opinion
1126822 essentially nothing was found to suggest that the scientist was more likely to have contracted the disease within esr than by contact in the wider community or elsewhere
1126823 the strain used in the laboratory and those identified from the samples taken from ms adu bobie are present in the general community
1126824 consequently there is no clear evidence to identify the source of the infection and as such no inferences can be made as to the cause of the exposure

1126852 there are also a number of unlisted infrastructure funds that are looking to co invest alongside someone who is already managing the asset

1126897 the five year contract creates an additional paid holiday iidal fitil a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
1126898 the new contract includes eight paid holidays which is the same number provided in the old contract
1126899 however the union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
1126900 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
1126901 is distinguished by the performance of communal prayer salat at daybreak on its first day it is a time of official receptions and private visits when friends greet one another presents are given new clothes are worn and the graves of relatives are visited
1126902 eid al fitr is one of eight paid holidays for all team members covered by the contract while labor day is not a paid holiday
1126903 based on the contract the other paid holidays include the team members birthday new years day martin luther king jr day memorial day independence day thanksgiving day and christmas day
1126904 implementing this holiday was a challenge since it falls on a different day every year and is declared on fairly short notice
1126905 but the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
1126906 the date for this holiday eid al fitr is not the same each year
1126907 all team members who have completed their probationary period are eligible for all eight paid holidays including eid al fitr

1126916 may i not stand wholly inside i keep the tent open by standing as i do
1126917 come wholly inside perhaps it will be better for both of us
1126918 union leaders say implementing the holiday was important for the nearly 700 muslims many of them somalis who work at the plant that employs a total of 1 200 people
1126919 if only muslims were clever politically they could take over the united states and replace its constitutional government with a caliphate if we were united and strong we would elect our own emir and give allegiance to him take my word if eight million muslims unite in america the country will come to us

1126924 labor day differs in every essential way from the other holidays of the year in any country
1126925 all other holidays are in a more or less degree connected with conflicts and battles of mans prowess over man of strife and discord for greed and power of glories achieved by one nation over another labor day is devoted to no man living or dead to no sect race or nation
1126926 labor day the first monday in september is a creation of the labor movement and is dedicated to the social and economic achievements of american workers it constitutes a yearly national tribute to the contributions workers have made to the strength prosperity and well being of our country

1126930 implementing this holiday was a challenge since it falls on a different day every year and is declared on fairly short notice
1126931 but the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians

1126937 weve had numerous sightings some of them were true sightings and others that we thought were true until we had some closer investigation reveal that is was a fox or a dog or what have you but certainly its not the first time weve had someone suggesting that theyve seen a cougar down in the valley thats for sure
1126938 we understand having talked with some other folks that they cougars have been in and out through this valley for sometime weve been fortunate to this date to have no encounters between humans and the cougars so lets hope thats the way it stays
1126939 i wont be wronged i wont be insulted and i wont be laid a hand on i dont do these things to other people and i require the same from them

1126955 these cats are just getting too friendly theyre not afraid of people
1126956 weve had situations where the cats are encountering people in their barns our cougar problems have gone up substantially used to be the deal was if you lived in cougar country your chances of seeing one cougar in your lifetime is about it
1126957 historically cougar incidents were very low and rare in the county
1126958 now it seems like its a weekly occurrence or close to that
1126959 a lot of the cougars that tend to get more into trouble with human activities are young animals dispersing into new territory
1126960 and i think part of the reason weve gotten more cougar reports from the public in recent years is that theres more public that have moved into these outlying areas
1126961 any hound hunting or cougar hunting in general should be based on the most current science and not politics
1126962 to further couch the pilot program in terms of public safety a tool set they already have we believe is disingenuous theres no body of evidence that says hound hunting is going to prevent or preclude problem cougars

1126967 our advertisement on television and the internet is very very good except for local television
1126968 in the long term the media and advertising outlook for asia is tremendous as wealth is created and people get educated and you see the emergence of a wealthy middle class
1126969 on a superficial level the bush administration leaves the us on better terms in
1126970 but at a deeper level theres been a hollowing out of our capabilities and a deteriorating of our strengths that will require full attention at home
1126971 will reduce our attraction in such a dynamic region as asia
1126972 is extremely well received among the say bush heard the point made by activists that his presence at the games legitimizes chinese government actions but he decided that without good relations with

1126984 that a fringe character such as anders is still active in the new party should be a red flag for those who want the conservatives to move to the centre the conservative party can become a national alternative to the liberals but harper will need the courage to tell old friends who have stood by him their time in the spotlight is over
1126985 this is but one riding example of the 308 where a party with populist roots has morphed into a governing force that uses strong arm tactics to ensure the fix is in for its preferred public face

1126995 i said howd you know that they said you are beaten anybody who comes up here and looks like you comes from yonkers
1126996 you have an assault by a good squad and then assault by the district attorney
1126997 im at a loss just like many of my friends are
1126998 shock is my initial take on this disbelief that anyone would accuse father harris or father wally as we would call him would ever accuse him of such a disgusting and vile act
1126999 at this moment its two more victims who are getting a bit of justice
1127000 why after so many years theyd come up with such accusations were all at a loss
1127001 we recognize that there is a possibility this might not be true
1127002 i just heard that they possibly spotted the rapist and they have the area sealed off
1127003 i open up the door and i see police running around
1127004 they need to catch him we hope they catch him
1127005 i hope they find this little creep because there are a lot of children teenage girls in this neighborhood
1127006 ill keep it in my house look at it every time i leave the house
1127007 if every garage mechanic and driver knew the details and was involved in the planning of the attack it never would have happened
1127008 you must decide the weight and significance if any such statements deserve
1127009 it is attention that has significance for the war on terror
1127010 we still have a lot of stimulus from the years that were very good the last couple of years our legs are still spinning in the air but were starting to look down and see the ground below us
1127011 we have to find ways to spend less and or increase our revenues and well do the same thing weve been doing try to make every agency do more with less
1127012 and if that isnt enough and if we cant find revenues then we would have to cut back
1127013 while you may save a few dollars in the short term you are destroying your economic base
1127014 tourists dont come here businesses dont stay here and expand people dont come here for education and health care all the things that generate the tax revenues we need
1127015 they spend money they spend it in restaurants they pay income taxes on it they buy cars they buy real estate they rent office space
1127016 there are all kinds of dimensions of this thing and it seems to play a little bit differently in each cycle and thats part of what were watching carefully

1127018 with msct and tdf serving as the foundation of bc3 the air force is better able to manage airspace over iraq by integrating multiple radars and displaying all air traffic

1127020 enough new oil will be found so that it can remain a primary source of energy for the foreseeable future
1127021 oil is running out and it is necessary to make a major effort to replace oil as a primary source of energy
1127022 the widespread consensus that oil needs to be replaced as an energy source may be prompted by concerns about the effect of oil on climate change as well as the belief that oil will run out
1127023 people around the world seem to assume that these higher prices are not only here to stay but will even go higher
1127024 publics around the world are not cheering for either side and want their governments to take an even handed approach
1127025 all of the key actors are seen as failing to do their part to break the impasse and most want the un security council to step in and offer peacekeeping forces and even security guarantees to help resolve the conflict
1127026 people should have the right to read whatever is on the internet
1127027 prevent people from having access to some things on the internet
1127028 people should have the right to read whatever is on the internet
1127029 for the media to be free to publish news and ideas without government control
1127030 have the right to read publications from all other countries including those that might be considered enemies
1127031 government should have the right to prevent the media from publishing things it thinks will be politically destabilizing
1127032 the will of the people should be the basis for the authority of government
1127033 the perception that governments are not responsive to the popular will appears to be contributing to the low levels of confidence in government found around the world
1127034 most see their governments as primarily serving big interests rather than the people as a whole
1127035 the will of the people should be the basis for the authority of government
1127036 should be governed according to the will of the people
1127037 government leaders should be selected through elections in which all citizens can vote
1127038 run by a few big interests looking out for themselves
1127039 government leaders should be selected through elections in which all citizens can vote
1127040 elections are the only time when the views of the people should have influence or that also between elections leaders should consider the views of the people as they make decisions
1127041 should not pay attention to public opinion polls because this will distract them from deciding what they think is right
1127042 should pay attention to public opinion polls because this will help them get a sense of the publics views
1127043 theres a concern about the introduction of landscape and visual evidence after that part of the hearing when our landscape expert witnesses arent available to give their evidence
1127044 if the application goes in our favour that will be huge i cant see why you cant look at these things wind farms on a national level to view them individually is irresponsible i think
1127045 the full potential of digital outdoor advertisements has not been realized due to the lack of both surveys and standardized comparisons the whole industry is still in an infant stage of development much like what earlier internet advertising was as the industry grows with more advertisers realizing our potential advertisement spending will dramatically increase first we have to provide the advertisers with more measurable support data and dmg is leading the way
1127046 this survey can help our clients to evaluate accurately the performance of digital advertising in the subway environment this systematic approach helps advertisers to plan subway tv advertising more scientifically
1127047 the new survey by nielsen has proven that we have made the correct investment for our client mcdonalds in the last 2 years of working with dmg
1127048 mcdonalds has always been trying to unlock the potential of new or emerging media formats to fulfill our strategy of improving customers experience anytime anywhere
1127049 dmg has fulfilled all criteria in this sense the latest rating report tabulated our effective media investment decisions in an accurate and adequate manner

1127053 the crux of the meeting was to determine and decipher where peter and myself can take this england team
1127054 i dont think i would be sitting here today if i wasnt 100 per cent confident that everything is going to be perfectly fine
1127055 mooresy likes to challenge us on a daily basis there are a lot of strong characters in the dressing room there are a lot of opinionated people in the dressing room i sat down with peter and we had a really good discussion on how we need to take this team forward
1127056 i think my position now is totally different as a captain than it was as a player we need to unite we need to get on the same hymn sheet and we need to get this team going forward
1127057 i like this city the environment the energy in the fans i think that ill play here for the remaining of my career
1127058 i told him that if the rule is to get a haircut then ill get one because i dont want any special privileges
1127059 but joe replied by saying that i should get an apartment and take care of my personal stuff first after which i should see a barber
1127060 good times never seemed so good so good so good so good
1127061 enough is enough im tired of them theyre tired of me after 2008 just send me a letter you dont even have to call my agent or whatever
1127062 if the red sox think they can find a trade to make the team better and both sides are going to be happy im going to agree
1127063 thats not going to happen boston is not stupid theyre not going to do it they can say whatever they want but when it comes to making a deal theyre not going to pull the trigger because they know what theyve got here
1127064 well does it make you feel any better to drive sixty miles an hour down this valley pike in the middle of the night
1127065 citizens certainly dont expect partisanship in an office like this the work of the state auditor is about government accountability and transparency not politics our audits are and should be independent and fair without even a hint of bias

1127074 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved

1127084 we should all engage in the green revolution in order to produce more food for our domestic consumption and the remainder we will export
1127085 mozambicans are eating bread baked from wheat from abroad which means that its price can increase at any time we eat rice but most of it comes from outside and the price outside is increasing we cannot control the price of products outside we can complain but we will get no results because as we are importers we will have to accept those prices
1127086 the high costs of food have made everyone aware of the fact that agriculture has been ignored by governments and donors for far too long
1127087 its good to see that this trend is reversing but these new investments must yield results we are encouraging everyone to work in partnership and to be as creative as possible in finding solutions
1127088 we eat what we dont produce and we produce what we dont eat

1127174 mccains campaign quickly pointed out that that is also a reversal for obama
1127175 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea 28 days ago is a slide in his poll numbers

1127189 if you knew bruce ivins you would understand it would be very difficult to put him in a role of a violent person he simply didnt have that in him
1127190 all of us want to see this the fact in this case brought to bear but we want to see the evidence we want to see the reasons to believe that bruce could be possibly guilty of these crimes and we want to be able to have that presented and not have this case closed
1127191 because he was about to be indicted on capital murder charges he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him

1127202 up there it was hell during the descent beyond 8 000 meters 26 000 feet due to the altitude and the exhaustion i even fell asleep in the snow and when i woke up i could not figure out where i was

1127267 when anyone has an infectious skin disease he must be brought to the priest
1127268 if the disease breaks out all over his skin and so far as the priest can see it covers all the skin of the infected person from head to foot

1127277 t he scope of our review of administrative decisions is narrow administrative agency decisions will be upheld unless arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law
1127278 w here congress has entrusted an administrative agency with the responsibility of selecting the means of achieving the statutory policy the relation of remedy to policy is peculiarly a matter for administrative competence
1127279 is limited to determining whether the remedy chosen was the result of an allowable judgment
1127280 failure to provide inventory records at the time of the august 25th inspection showing the whereabouts of every acquired animal

1127285 such investigations or inspections as he deems necessary to determine whether any dealer has violated or is violating any provision
1127286 n othing restricts this authority of inspection to licensed dealers all dealers are subject to investigations and inspections and a dealer is defined to include any person who in commerce buys or sells dogs or other animals for research and derives over 500 00 gross income from those sales during any calendar year
1127287 respondents contend that the violations were not willful but a violation is willful if it is done intentionally or with careless disregard of statutory requirements
1127288 acts with careless disregard of statutory requirements the violation is willful
1127289 to establish willfulness the agency only needed to show that petitioners ongoing failure to act was intentional as opposed to accidental proof of an evil motive is unnecessary

1127437 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
1127438 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
1127439 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
1127440 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
1127441 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
1127442 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
1127443 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
1127444 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
1127445 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
1127446 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
1127447 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
1127448 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
1127449 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
1127450 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
1127451 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
1127452 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
1127453 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
1127454 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
1127455 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
1127456 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
1127457 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
1127458 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
1127459 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
1127460 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
1127461 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
1127462 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
1127463 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
1127464 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
1127465 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
1127466 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
1127467 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
1127468 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
1127469 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
1127470 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
1127471 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
1127472 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
1127473 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
1127474 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
1127475 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
1127476 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
1127477 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
1127478 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
1127479 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
1127480 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
1127481 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
1127482 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
1127483 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
1127484 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off

1127490 the compression lines the density features do show and there is no way to fake that
1127491 it is possible to carve a track in limestone but there is no way to compress the material in the rock under the track that is absolutely impossible thats why the cat scans are so important

1127494 even though they the sec would never admit it patrick byrne helped instruct them in the danger when the time came they understood the threat
1127495 what i dont understand is why the sec is only addressing fannie mae freddie mac and the large investment banks why should those companies be the only ones protected
1127496 we know it has been going on and that its been harmful to share prices
1127497 one of the big concerns we have is that depositors often can not distinguish the difference between a stock price dropping and the safety of their deposits and soundness of their bank
1127498 rather than fixing any of the real problems with the agency and its mission cox and his fellow commissioners waved a newspaper and swatted the imaginary fly of naked short selling it made a big noise but theres no dead bug
1127499 byrne has said that the secs politically motivated pandering means that he has won the intellectual argument on naked short selling
1127500 but there hasnt been an intellectual argument there has been a campaign of intimidation and personal attacks against critics of his poor management of his company and his naked shorting jihad
1127501 what theyre saying is that if he only ran a better liquor store he wouldnt get robbed as much
1127502 then she mentioned about how shed read about all the horrible things i was doing and how it appeared like id gone completely off the deep end
1127503 as we sat down he said patrick i want you to know that you have become the most hated man ive ever known in all my life here in new york
1127504 when i think of what might happen to the financial system as a result of all of this it just makes me sick there is no joy in being right
1127505 when governments fear people there is liberty when the people fear the government there is tyranny

1127521 then took they jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of malchiah the son of hammelech that was in the court of the prison and they let down jeremiah with cords and in the dungeon there was no water but mire so jeremiah sunk in the mire
1127522 he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is for there is no more bread in the city
1127523 the wet sifting that we did for the destruction debris from our excavations indeed allowed us to uncover hundreds of different kinds of small finds such as tiny fish bones phoenician glass beads hebrew babylonian and egyptian bullae and seals pits and seeds hematite and limestone weights arrowheads figurines jewelry and more

1127533 we have been told repeatedly over the years that ivf babies are just as healthy as those conceived naturally well it looks like things are not going as well as we were led to believe
1127534 after being raised with love and care in india amidst a family of five girls it was difficult for me to comprehend that female children are disdained in my country of birth so much so that female fetuses are aborted without regard for the law moral values or the delicate balance of nature
1127535 lucy lanelly was just 12 years old when she had her first abortion shes blanked out most of the memories but what she does recall are her mother shelleys tears of shame as they arrived at the private clinic and the disapproving looks of the medical staff when they discovered lucys age she does not remember feeling frightened at the prospect of the operation only a strange emotional numbness and feeling of guilt at having upset her mother her chief emotion when she came round from the general anaesthetic was one of relief that she could forget shed ever been pregnant and get back to school i didnt understand what was going on she says my mum organized the termination and i went along with it but it was the right thing to do there was no question of keeping the baby i didnt want it i was too young to have a baby it was a mistake a traumatic experience for one so young yet by the time she was 16 lucy had made three more mistakes the second termination aged 13 was again organized by her mother a mental health nurse who was this time furious with her wayward daughter for ignoring her lectures and sat by her side in stony silence at the clinic when lucy fell pregnant again aged 15 she was too frightened to tell her mother so it was her grandmother who took her to the clinic unaware of the previous two abortions lucy organized her fourth termination aged 16 without telling anyone she insists each time it was the right decision and that her four abortions have left no lasting emotional damage
1127536 south dakotas families dont need big government telling them what they can and cant do
1127537 families know their own circumstances best but this ban would strip families of a private moral decision and a woman would be forced to carry a pregnancy to term even in the fetus couldnt survive on its own after delivery
1127538 we just wanted to draw attention to the fact that a child cannot be a damage
1127539 you should have zeen za nut vit a camera i poked today
1127540 ive been trying to make sense of all this and this is what ive come up with i reckon there are broadly three catholic responses to the crisis in the anglican communion
1127541 the presence of three cardinals at the lambeth conference has not attracted the attention it deserves rome is keeping its cards close to its chest with regards to the anglican communion but something is going on and the future shape of the church of england may depend on it
1127542 bishop tom i hear youre ordaining kitchen chairs these days
1127543 well take our time over receiving the anglicans this time
1127544 they can be fined for being opposite parliament the home of our democracy with a badge and thats nuts
1127545 if the government and police are saying there could be a terrorist threat unless they get terrorists to licence a demonstration to be there thats patently absurd
1127546 we want the police and the politicians to know that these laws preventing us from peaceful protest are ridiculous the government needs to know that it has passed bad law
1127547 so what if im working its not benefit fraud if i only do it now and again is it anyway everyone is doing it
1127548 so what if i exchange the odd peerage for cash its not corruption if i promise to pay the money back at some point is it anyway its been going on for years
1127549 so what if british companies pass the odd backhander occasionally its not corruption if there are jobs at stake is it anyway everyone is doing it
1127550 its unfair to criticize us we are no more corrupt then anyone else

1127554 let china be we now have other priorities that are not china
1127555 at this moment china is not a country at war with us if there are attacks against muslims these hit the dispossessed that must leave those lands and move to islamic countries
1127556 bothersome actions like these are not foreseen by islamic sharia law or good sense
1127557 what interest do we have in turning china against muslims at the moment
1127558 at this moment holy warriors mujahadeen do not need to open a new front with china
1127559 we must be very careful and have patience we do not need to rush and shout god is great or justify this type of action for all i know i have never heard any of the al qaeda leaders threaten china
1127560 we have shown that b serrata enriched with akba can be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee
1127561 certainly osteoarthritis is in need of new safe analgesics although many effective therapies that reduce pain such as muscle strengthening exercises shock absorbing footwear and weight loss have very few bad side effects
1127562 take your time to chalk out the plan and involve all organiazations bodies and ngos working in the health sector in this campaign

1127595 implements a new holiday to accommodate the muslim workers at the plant
1127596 the five year contract creates an additional paid holiday iidal fitil a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
1127597 the new contract includes eight paid holidays which is the same number provided in the old contract
1127598 however the union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
1127599 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
1127600 is distinguished by the performance of communal prayer salat at daybreak on its first day it is a time of official receptions and private visits when friends greet one another presents are given new clothes are worn and the graves of relatives are visited
1127601 eid al fitr is one of eight paid holidays for all team members covered by the contract while labor day is not a paid holiday
1127602 based on the contract the other paid holidays include the team members birthday new years day martin luther king jr day memorial day independence day thanksgiving day and christmas day
1127603 implementing this holiday was a challenge since it falls on a different day every year and is declared on fairly short notice
1127604 but the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
1127605 the date for this holiday eid al fitr is not the same each year
1127606 all team members who have completed their probationary period are eligible for all eight paid holidays including eid al fitr
1127607 two prayer rooms have been created to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant

1127665 i recently had a radio gig with natasha bedingfield and we were backstage and we were talking and we swapped numbers
1127666 i was like lets get together and write something lets do something lets go to the studio and jam
1127667 she was down i would love to do something with her shes an amazing vocalist
1127668 we knew we were locked into a r rating from the language in the beginning of the movie anyway from all the war movie dialogue
1127669 you just have to do that if youre doing a war movie i think a lot of these studio guys talk like that i know from personal experience i have heard people in movie studios curse
1127670 ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
1127671 its not helping us and its not helping him sitting out right tackle jon runyan said
1127672 the longer he holds out the longer itll be before he gets in there so its going to be a tough situation if you keep giving reps to the guy whos backing you up at some point hes going to pass you
1127673 coach reid isnt going to let that happen so im not worried about it
1127674 lb rocky boiman de chris clemons you know q s quintin mikell stepped back into the role as he knows the leadership last year he was really focusing on his defensive reps and this year i think he feels more comfortable with his defensive reps and hes able to give a little bit more attention back to special teams
1127675 he was a rookie last year anytime youve got a bunch of rookies on the field theyre going to make mistakes stewart made some mistakes last year but he obviously again he had that physical ability he got better as the year went along from a physical standpoint sure we knew he would be there but its just like on offense and defense young guys make mistakes and thats what occurred last year on special teams a little bit
1127676 andy reid wont just come out and say it but the eagles are thrilled with what they see out of lorenzo booker reid said he liked the patience booker has shown he was referring to his patience in the running game i like his patience in the passing game as well at the early practice this morning safety quintin mikell tried to cover him in a one on one drill and it was like a joke he turned mikell around and left him there with his jock laying on the ground i dont want to overdo it but teams are going to have headaches trying to keep track of booker and brian westbrook i was standing on the sideline chatting with mike quick and he was saying the same thing booker has picked up this offense in less than a year
1127677 its like your regular defense but just with a lot of safeties in there you have to make sure everythings straight
1127678 warning signs surround jones he played as the lesser back in a two back rotation in college relied somewhat on a gimmick offense and at 207 pounds his 4 47 in the combine 40 yard dash yielded only a 103 7 speed score below the 112 point average for a first round pick
1127679 they should be better than the regular season giants and not as good as the postseason ones
1127680 week 14 david akers lines up for a 57 yard
1127681 judging mannings ability based on those stupendously fluky outcomes is like crediting your neighbor for buying the one house in the neighborhood that has oil underneath it
1127682 eli manning was hurried on a below average number of pass plays but when he was hurried he had the worst dvoa of any quarterback with at least 30 passes under pressure
1127683 as easy as it is to lay the blame at his feet donovan mcnabb was not the problem with the 2007 philadelphia eagles
1127684 the difference is that tiki barber spent virtually his entire career without missing time due to injury while westbrook has missed time each year
1127685 no team passes more often from two tight end sets
1127686 philadelphia hurried quarterbacks more often than any other nfc defense
1127687 seventh round pick king dunlap has a first round name third round talent and 47th round work ethic
1127688 i think as tech moves to tier 1 status youll find all of its supporters very excited people support things that they have a passion for theyll support programs that we grow and develop as their passions as well
1127689 it has a great name recognition those are the key things you have to have a state wide scope for recruiting students you have to have well defined well developed research in doctoral programs and then you need a lot of recognition this is a highly visible institution
1127690 the white coat ceremony for texas tech coincides with the first day of medical school and its very symbolic
1127691 putting on the white coat is a symbol for the medical students of a commitment to professionalism a commitment to life long study and a commitment to being an excellent physician
1127692 the other significance of the ceremony is the students made their own oath
1127693 together in small groups they came up with an oath of what they want to say and what they want to commit to just beginning medical school
1127694 ive wanted to go into health care ever since i was young
1127695 ive put so much effort into studying and pursing the experiences that will prepare me to become a physician and im just glad that im here and i feel really honored
1127696 the quality of life here is very good and its a really friendly environment
1127697 we are in my opinion and have been for some time one of the very best universities in the nation
1127698 and it thrilled me that the princeton review recognized what i have known for quite some time
1127699 the third thing they do is they try a real balance of schools from different states large schools and small ones mens colleges womens colleges and so forth so it gives a prospective applicant a nice variety of great schools to consider
1127700 the princeton review does not rank schools normally and we do that for a very important reason
1127701 we really dont think you can ever say there is a best school one single best school in the country and ranking has become something that we think people sometimes pay a little too much attention to and will not help someone know if that school is the best school for them
1127702 sometimes the quarterback gets too much credit sometimes he gets too much blame
1127703 the players are focused theres leadership theyre showing the young guys
1127704 the goals are defined for the veterans somewhere along the road you hope you can bring something
1127705 i think right now mark is just learning the offense and getting used to the system this is a new offense for him hes somebody who is another set of eyes right now
1127706 pat does a great job with developing kolb marty does a great job with that part of it its a great opportunity for mark to learn from those guys and then share ideas with them
1127707 hell be another set of eyes ill give him some things to look at marty gives him certain projects to do its a matter of just kind of getting acclimated to what we do here
1127708 thats more velocity than ive ever seen in my life
1127709 it caught me off guard and i dropped a pass that hit right off my chest i wont let that happen to me again
1127710 its always been kind of a passing camp without pads
1127711 theyre here theyre both signed theyre learning in the classroom and spending time with defensive line coach pete jenkins in the classroom right now i dont think theyre missing a lot on the field wait until we get the pads on
1127712 well some guys feel like they can play out their deal and things happen
1127713 but my rookie year i had a very unfortunate accident a fractured fibula in his first game and you never know what tomorrow is going to hold i have a daughter and my mom i want that security and just to be here i am an eagle and this is where i want to be i havent been to any other team but i have heard stories from guys at other teams and this is where i want to be
1127714 if ladainian tomlinson got paid 25 million guaranteed in 2003 and now its 2008 the next person needs to be paid 30 million guaranteed
1127715 it works its way up you cant sit here and say im as good as ladainian right now and im getting paid five years after him so ill take 15 million that doesnt make any sense
1127716 westbrooks final point about his contract is that if the eagles gave him an extension it would provide incentive for his teammates
1127717 tarence is a talented young perimeter player that has good length and athleticism
1127718 he has shown an ability to be an effective player on both ends of the court
1127719 expressive or visual conduct of a sexual or gender motivated nature
1127720 we have found no categorical rule that divests harassing speech as defined by federal anti discrimination statutes of first amendment protection
1127721 w hen laws against harassment attempt to regulate oral or written expression on such topics however detestable the views expressed may be we cannot turn a blind eye to the first amendment implications
1127722 does not pass on whether the eeoc language endorsing workplace harassment liability under a standard similar to temples is or is not constitutional
1127723 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
1127724 given the physical effort you need to perform at this level i had to make a choice
1127725 the combination of real madrids competition cup and champions league games on the one hand and the netherlands team on the other would be too heavy a burden for me
1127726 he said look ive got to get up im going to walk out of here
1127727 now been shut down by the department of buildings but club lawyer ken fisher says the club has fixed whatever led to the failed inspection
1127728 its gratifying to know we wont have any problems for a while but its not as if im wishing the club disappeared off the face of the earth forever i look forward to see whats going to happen next
1127729 the contractor decided over the weekend to employ additional equipment that was not immediately available

1127732 while our retail division struggled this quarter our wholesale business performed well and we were pleased with the sales increases in each of our brands especially in light of the overall challenging retail environment
1127733 there will always be trendy urbanites ready to dismiss politicians particularly eton educated tory ones but the important thing is that now the cons are irrevocably linked with eco ism a caring and unselfish agenda
1127734 encouraged more selling in the grains not that any encouragement is needed
1127735 the priest and the levite who passed by the beaten traveller in chapter ten of lukes gospel probably tithed but they were stingy only the good samaritan was not a professor who gives high grades to mediocre papers so that students will go away happy and he need not explain how they erred is stingy parents who give their children nintendos or turbographic 16s but do not walk with them by the roadside and play games with them on the dining room table are stingy
1127736 the bumper book of government waste 2008 browns squandered billions
1127737 the regulations are there for a purpose they are not perfect they are there to preserve fish stocks so that the uk and europe can continue to enjoy fish

1127744 je navais pas le temps dengager une discussion la seule chose que je devais faire c tait descendre car quand on descend on a plus doxyg ne et donc plus de chances de survivre

1127747 we could save all the oil that their talking about getting off drilling
1127748 if you want to say that when someone dies they go to heaven fine but thats only a temporary holding pattern that is life after death and what im much more interested in or the new testament is much more interested in is what ive called life after life after death
1127749 ive often put it like this if somebody you know has been very ill you say poor old so and so hes just a shadow of his former self and the extraordinary truth in the new testament is that if you are in christ and dwell by the spirit you are just a shadow of your future self
1127750 there is a real you to which the present you corresponds as a photocopy corresponds to the glorious original you know there is a real you which god is going to make and it will be more physical more real not less
1127751 it is an attempt to make sense of some bits of the new testament it was always the literature of the dispossessed its now become the literature of the rich masses in parts of america

1127756 before philip called you when you were under the fig tree i saw you
1127757 rabbi you are the son of god you are the king of israel
1127758 because i said to you i saw you under the fig tree do you believe you will see greater things than these
1127759 truly truly i say to you you will see heaven opened and the angels of god ascending and descending on the son of man

1127769 i have no qualms about jumping in a taxi here or even walking main streets at night not something i would have done in wealthy and prosperous johannesburg a place i visited only in march this year
1127770 our contribution may be modest but it is better than doing nothing at all
1127771 its a damning indictment of the labour partys economic management that they got into this mess
1127772 current inflation reflects the failure of the mpc to raise rates nearly sufficiently in 2006 and 2007 this was a significant predictable and predicted consequence of a straightforward policy error
1127773 current rising inflation is heavily driven in the short term by the path of oil prices
1127774 theyll just take the money back at a later date
1127775 the assumption of some british pundits that obama will be a shoo in for the white house is wishful thinking
1127776 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
1127777 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
1127778 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
1127779 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years

1127786 what were trying to get the court to say is that for the duration of a contract the telephone company should not be able to unilaterally modify the conditions of the contract
1127787 because they needed to operate in a stable taxation area
1127788 should the government levy a windfall tax because of rising oil gas prices
1127789 we knew we shouldnt expect to see something like that
1127790 the really cool thing is that all the details are still there
1127791 the existence of wet based glaciers proglacial lakes tundra vegetation and insect remains all indicate that the climate of the western olympus range was warmer and wetter that that of today

1127875 supone un nuevo r cord negativo en toda la serie hist rica del paro registrado desde que se cambi la metodolog a de medici n en 1996
1127876 julio supone ya el decimocuarto mes en el que el desempleo se incrementa de manera consecutiva dicho con otras palabras ya se cumple m s de un a o desde el que el incremento interanual del paro no cesa de aumentar adem s cada vez con un
1127877 quinto peor dato del a o bastante en l nea con lo que sucedi en junio
1127878 por sectores y aplicando el m todo anterior vemos que la explicaci n m s com n en los medios de comunicaci n del aumento del paro no es del todo cierta la construcci n ya no es el principal responsable ya que su ritmo de crecimiento se est estancando e incluso cayendo
1127879 casi de la mitad del aumento del paro de este mes aportan el 49 por ciento de los nuevos parados respecto a mayo de 2007
1127880 llamativo el incremento del paro intermensual de este sector en un mes de julio 0 9 por ciento cuando estacionalmente es el sector que mejor se comporta en dicho mes no obstante es cierto que los servicios siguen creando empleo pero a ritmos de crecimiento insuficientes 1 6 por ciento para absorber la oferta de trabajadores sin que aumente al paro
1127881 paro se reduce por el repunte de las contrataciones propias de los meses estivales esto no s lo no sucede en este a o sino que la cuant a de los incrementos es preocupante
1127882 si el paro aumentara a partir de agosto tanto como lo hizo el a o pasado 160 000
1127883 especialmente bueno para dicho sector por el repunte de las contrataciones estivales cuyos ritmos de crecimiento en a os anteriores fueron del 3 3 por ciento en julio de 2007 y del 5 por ciento en julio de 2006
1127884 entre julio de 2007 y junio de 2008 el desempleo ya ha supuesto 2 770 millones de euros m s que en el mismo per odo del a o anterior y de continuar al actual ritmo de crecimiento ascender a a 4 600 millones m s
1127885 el gasto total en subsidios de desempleo ser a de 20 000 millones de euros

1127974 and solzhenitsyn changed the story of the story of the soviet union he changed it from this difficult march to utopia to the decline of a brutal totalitarian state and his version of the soviet union lived longer than the official account that is a kind of social and cultural power that is special to writers

1128017 you can hunt around and you will find a few kids meals that are nutritionally pretty good
1128018 but the vast majority of meals are too high in calories saturated fat or sodium they are all made with refined white flour rather than whole wheat flour not the kind of meals we ought to be encouraging people to eat

1128049 what begins with a solitary bloodstain in a stolen sedan quickly spirals outward in odd and unexpected directions leading from the well heeled center of l a society to its desperate edges across the paths of commodities brokers and transvestite hookers and as far away as new york city where the search thaws out a long cold case and exposes a grotesque homicidal crusade

1128088 je hebt gisteren al eens geprobeerd me te hypnotiseren en daarna die rare act met de magistraat ik wil nu eindelijk wel eens weten wat er aan de hand is en ik geloof dat jij de antwoorden kent
1128089 ik heb je uitgekozen omdat je jong en populair bent meer niet ik verwachtte niet dat er ook nog hersenen in dat mooie jongetje zouden zitten maar ik heb al die moeite niet voor niets gedaan en ik wil niet dat jij nu alles teniet doet alleen maar omdat je te koppig bent om je geheugen te laten wissen je hebt geen idee wat er speelt doe wat ik zeg dan blijf je leven en anders gaan we er allemaal aan
1128090 ten eerste ik ben je meid niet we gaan wel een tijdje doen alsof maar jij bent van mij niet andersom ik zocht een vechter deze halsband was voor jou bedoeld hierin zit alle kennis van de gevechtstechnieken van duizend werelden je zou een wachter zijn geworden een grotere krijger dan deze wereld in duizenden jaren heeft gezien
1128091 voor mij werkt hij niet ik heb nu wel de kennis maar niet jouw kracht en lenigheid dus ik heb je nog steeds nodig al ben je nu een stuk minder nuttig voor me
1128092 en ik heb geen idee waarom ik je zou willen helpen ga van me af ik heb wat bij te leggen met wesp
1128093 ik ben vanaf nu jouw toegewijde slavinnetje of je dat nu wilt of niet en als het moment daar is dan vertel ik je wat je moet doen ik weet dat je slim genoeg bent om dan in te zien dat wat ik van je vraag ook echt nodig is tot die tijd is het niet belangrijk dat jij weet wat er aan de hand is en ga nou maar naar je meisje
1128094 ik ben eigenlijk wel blij dat je me dit vertelt want ik haat die man en als de vrouwe jou nodig heeft om hem ten val te brengen dan heeft ze mijn zegen ik was bang dat je onze mug nu al vergeten was maar dit is gelukkig iets heel anders dus zou ik zeggen speel het spelletje maar mee
1128095 geen overtreding blijft onbestraft van moord tot spugen op straat ik weet precies wat er gebeurt en ik stuur overal meteen de wacht op af
1128096 vorige keer waren ze bij ons nu gaan we matilo een tegenbezoekje brengen vandaag is er een bijzondere training en meteen daarna vetrekken we jullie komen hier dus vandaag niet meer terug iedereen gaat mee ook de nieuwelingen als iedereen weg is hebben wij hier de rust om deze zwijnenstal eens grondig schoon te maken eet rustig je ontbijt op en verzamel al je eigendommen wat achterblijft wordt verkocht na het eten gaan jullie je n voor n melden bij de deur
1128097 je moet even niet moeilijk doen die rotzooi moeten we onderweg aanhouden t is niet erg comfortabel maar het scheelt twee wagons voor de bagage dat wil zeggen de salarissen van twee voermannen plus eten voor vier paarden dat is een boel geld en geld is voor de stad belangrijker dan ons comfort als je teveel protesteert maken ze het je alleen maar ongemakkelijker

1128107 we have a lease through 2014 and the rights for a five years extension after that
1128108 they were literally living in dog crates chained to the ground with no food no water
1128109 there were decapitated dogs heads all over the property hanging from trees
1128110 we dont know how the dogs died or why their heads were cut off we are investigating him for crimes against animals
1128111 quite a bit of fight scars on them that had been sutured together
1128112 we dont know that this gentleman was using them for fighting sometimes when animals are in huge packs they will fight
1128113 while we are caring for them right now they are legally his until the da district attorney decides whether or not to prosecute
1128114 maybe he will want to surrender some of the animals to us hypothetically we will be able to put them up for adoption
1128115 the case isnt coming to us and wont be coming to us until at least wednesday
1128116 im concerned that if he returns he will continue in the actions that bring us here today
1128117 he is not a threat and he is not a flight risk
1128118 its my understanding that there had been similar complaints years ago but this is the first complaint weve had recently
1128119 several dogs were locked up in small dog crates that you would use to transport covered in their own feces and urine
1128120 quite a bit of fight scars on them that had been sutured together
1128121 we dont know that this gentleman was using them for fighting
1128122 sometimes when animals are in huge packs they will fight
1128123 he had ads in newspapers over there i dont know if he currently has ads
1128124 the majority of the animals that we pulled out of there were not purebred
1128125 we have no intention of giving any dogs back to this gentleman
1128126 the case wont be coming to us until at least wednesday
1128127 im sure the animals will be a lot better off somewhere else
1128128 access to 10 national newspapers from 1985 to date 50 journals and periodicals covering subjects from astronomy and computing right through to geography and science
1128129 i am not so sure hes capable of backing off
1128130 i think hes kind of got a mind set which i think is the best way to race for a championship to go after it every week we wouldnt want to have him do anything other than try to win every race
1128131 im not a happy person when im not running well
1128132 you try to look forward at things and hopefully you can say that 13 is reasonable
1128133 it was pretty cool growing up and watching him and those times when he was able to run well and get those marks and think of the unbelievable seasons that he was having watching him when i was a kid
1128134 if theres a shot for it that would be pretty cool
1128135 when the chase starts theres going to be a different race going on
1128136 theres not going to be the race of going out for wins and doing pit strategy things and stuff like that which will take your chance out of a good top 10 or a good top five you just have to be consistent and stay up there in order to get those finishes
1128137 we zullen een verbod om te staken vragen en de schade volledig op hen laten verhalen
1128138 wakker worden ares het is etenstijd en je wordt aan de tafel verwacht kom je mee

1128145 vergeet wie deze vrouw ooit was zij is niemand meer o koning van de nacht een geschenk voor de overwinnaar een middag vertier meer niet daarna was er een informeel diner wij hebben gegeten en te veel gedronken goede vrienden zijn wij geworden nu ben je moe nu wil je terug naar de arena

1128149 hee chill gast ik ben je fan niet iedereen houdt van killers het is echt goed dat je laat zien dat je walgt van wat je moet doen dat is niet zwak en dat je nu al buiten mag rondlopen echt goed joh die act op het slappe koord flux het werd tijd dat er weer eens een held kwam van onze leeftijd en we staan achter je als je iemand nodig hebt laat je het maar weten heb je ooit hulp nodig kom naar de helleput
1128150 wat heeft de koning gisteren allemaal uitgespookt en wie is dit
1128151 veel plezier met je cadeau ik dacht dat jij tegen slavernij was hypocriet
1128152 when i was growing up smoking was glamorous film stars would pose for the cameras with a cigarette in their hand

1128154 i moved on to a pack of five then ten and when i started working it was 20 and i would smoke a pack a day i didnt realise it at the time but i was a pretty young woman

1128157 shuffling from one room to another dragging an oxygen bottle with me
1128158 i know giving up smoking is a struggle but smokers dont see people in hospital hooked up to machines dying slow painful undignified deaths and they should
1128159 i hope my story can stop even one person smoking
1128160 i spoke to maureen a couple of months ago she was desperate to pass on her experience to try to prevent young people smoking
1128161 i hope her message lives on in some way it would be a fitting tribute

1128216 sommigen van jullie gaan sterven anderen zullen gewond raken en weer anderen zullen deze dag als overwinnaars gehuldigd worden tien mannen en vrouwen gaan voor het eerst de arena binnen om te vechten tegen de kampioenen van een andere stad de meeste van jullie hebben goed getraind maar ook van degenen onder jullie die zich reeds met de dood verzoend hebben verwacht ik een waardig optreden de burgers van de stad kijken toe misschien zijn jullie toekomstige ouders er wel bij beschaam hen niet en voor n van jullie is het de zevende en laatste keer dat hij op zal treden en dat is satyr satyr ik draag deze dag aan jou op het publiek komt voor jou jij bent vandaag onze held jullie tegenstanders komen uit matilo een stad aan de kust in de arena zal een slag uit de oertijd worden nagespeeld jullie staan voor de oermachten van het wilde land de insecten de monsters en de barbaren van het dorp dat hier stond voordat de goden beschaving brachten in dit spektakel moeten jullie je dorp beschermen tegen de barbaren en piraten van de zee dat zijn jullie tegenstanders zij kwamen aan per schip en zijn geland op het strand er is een schip nagebouwd waar de gladiatoren van matilo uit zullen komen jullie staan opgesteld aan de rand van de arena het bos de zeebarbaren vallen aan op het signaal van een schelphoorn en raken slaags met onze monsters dit gevecht duurt een half uur daarna zijn er onderhandelingen tussen onze koning van de nacht en de kapitein die mis lopen koning ares ik wil dat je er een mooie ruzie van maakt maar val hem niet aan jullie zijn allebei later in het spektakel nog nodig en hij is bovendien veel te sterk voor je als de kapitein weer aan boord is geef je het teken aan de insecten en de barbaren die komen dan uit het woud om samen met jou het schip te veroveren de wilde dieren worden even later losgelaten dus het is zaak om snel aan boord te zijn op het dek en in het want wordt gevochten en wie van het schip valt komt tussen de dieren terecht koning jij hebt de afgelopen twee weken leren touwlopen jij moet via het want in de voorste mast klimmen over het touw naar de achterste mast lopen en daar de uitkijk verslaan satyr aan het einde van de dag daag jij de kapitein uit voor een tweegevecht het is voor jullie allebei het laatste gevecht en de winnaar is een vrij man als je het niet allemaal hebt onthouden dat is niet erg jullie krijgen het nog twee keer te horen tijdens het aankleden wordt jouw rol nog een keer met je doorgenomen en voor je de arena ingaat vertel ik het hele verhaal nog een keer zo meteen gaan jullie n voor n met de soldaten mee in de kleedkamer worden je arm en enkelboeien afgedaan en je mag daar je wapenrustingen aantrekken dan gaan jullie n voor n naar de voorzaal waar je jouw wapen krijgt en daarna ga je de arena in daar stellen jullie je op volgens mijn aanwijzingen
1128217 even doorbijten jongen nu niet opgeven en niet bang zijn je bent al dood weet je nog als je eenmaal daar bent nemen de reflexen het over ik weet hoe belangrijk vrijheid voor je is maar eigenlijk is er geen andere plaats waar je werkelijk vrij bent dan hier in de arena de adel leeft eeuwig tot je vermoord wordt dus jullie kunnen je geen vrijheid veroorloven wij burgers mogen veel meer maar er zijn grenzen die we niet kunnen overschrijden als we onze onsterfelijke herinneringen willen behouden en de slaven moeten gewoon doen wat hun baas hen vertelt maar hier hier mag je zelf kiezen of je aan die rol wilt blijven vasthouden of dat je op eigen kracht voor jezelf een nieuwe lotsbestemming maakt
1128218 nu zijn wij je weet toch wat je moet doen loop naar voren schud met je speer en roep mijn naam zo moeilijk is dat niet
1128219 boeren burgers buitenlui hoogge erd publiek ik ben ares de nachtkoning van ulpia en ik breng u een spektakel dat uw dromen zal overtreffen de kapers van matilo bedreigen onze mooie stad maar wij hebben beesten mensen en goden die de stad beschermen
1128220 en de grootste hiervan is vandaag de held ik wil een warm applaus voor satyr
1128221 dit valt me enorm van je mee succes zo meteen
1128222 waar is de koning van de nacht vertoon je de kapers van matilo staan voor de poort en eisen je overgave
1128223 kaper laat je kapersbrieven maar eens zien je bent een piraat meer niet
1128224 sturen jullie een kind om te onderhandelen lafaards maar als jullie jongentje echt voor je stadje spreekt laat hem dan maar aan de tafel komen en met mij drinken
1128225 jullie hebben mijn bootsman gedood dat was niet de afspraak als jullie vals spelen dan kan ik dat ook het is vandaag toch mijn laatste dag dus ik maak je gewoon af
1128226 ik een kind je hebt geen idee wie je tegenover je hebt ik ben de koning van de nacht je vleesgeworden nachtmerrie als je wilt sterven dat kan trek je mannen terug behoudt je leven verlaat onze kust en keer nooit weer
1128227 luister eens ik vind het ook vreselijk wat er gebeurd is maar vetkwak was gewoon veel beter dan hij en het is uiteindelijk de magistraat die je bootsman heeft vermoord niet ik
1128228 i dont know how they think in the salons of san francisco
1128229 energy is clearly unambiguously the number one issue in the u s
1128230 on the streets of miami an ak 47 is cheaper to buy than a playstation
1128231 die beesten moeten weg voordat de mensen van boord kunnen dus snel een beetje
1128232 ik heb de poort al open gedaan en ik zal van binnenuit de hekken van de hokken bedienen jij moet ze er naar toe drijven kijk een beetje uit met de beren de rest is er al aan gewend
1128233 ik ben blij dat je nog leeft ares en heel blij dat we je even kunnen spreken
1128234 ik ben ook heel blij jullie weer te zien ik heb me zon zorgen gemaakt over ebba en adran en wienald leven ze nog
1128235 ja ze zijn vrijgelaten maar wienald is uit de stad verbannen ik spreek hem nog regelmatig hij is naar het platteland gegaan hij woont nu op de boerderij bij ebba maar adran is weg en niemand weet waar hij is we kunnen niet lang praten want ik moet de riten voor de doden opvoeren en simon en leonard gaan de satyr zijn naam teruggeven en tot burger verheffen ik denk dat jij daar bij hoort te zijn maar dat vindt de magistraat niet goed die heeft echt een hekel aan jou hij is ook heel erg boos dat je niet een van de anonieme gladiatoren bent want als de mensen het hier in de stad over je hebben kan hij je niet zomaar uit de weg laten ruimen gelukkig lijkt de arenameester aan jouw kant te staan die doet er alles aan om je populair te maken er zijn mensen vandaag speciaal voor jou gekomen je was al een held en na vandaag kan jouw reputatie voorlopig niet meer stuk wil jij mij helpen met de gevallenen dan kunnen we nog een beetje bijpraten
1128236 maar dat zijn mensen waar ik mee samen heb gegeten en gelachen en
1128237 had je een vriendinnetje dat is vreselijk wijs haar maar aan
1128238 niet huilen jongen kom mee dan kun je haar de laatste eer bewijzen er zijn niet veel mensen die zo afscheid van hun vrienden kunnen nemen
1128239 hier je mag haar ziel even vasthouden hij is nog warm
1128240 als je die armband omdoet zal haar ziel bij jou blijven maar dan verlies je langzaam jezelf en neemt zij je lichaam over of jij bent sterker en dan vervaagt zij daar worden jullie geen van beide gelukkig van geef haar maar weer aan mij ik zal lieve ouders voor haar uitzoeken
1128241 wat gebeurt er met de mensen die geen armband hebben
1128242 dat is een heel verhaal ik zal maar bij het begin beginnen vroeger waren alle mensen sterfelijk toen ging de ziel van een overledene naar andere werelden om daar opnieuw te leven het was een lange reis van de laagste werelden naar de hoogste door de twaalf niveaus van bestaan heen totdat iedere ziel weer opging in het ene de goden hebben besloten dat dit geen goed systeem was lang na de strijd tegen de oermachten hebben zij aan de mensen onsterfelijkheid geschonken de helden en meest nobele mensen kregen fysieke onsterfelijkheid en de gewone burgers mochten hun persoonlijkheid behouden van leven tot leven alleen de allerlaagste demonische wezens hebben geen onsterfelijkheid gekregen omdat de doorgangen tussen de drie bestaansniveaus door de goden afgesloten zijn blijft ieder op de wereld waar hij sterft de allerhoogste de bovenhemelse werelden zijn gereserveerd voor de goden en hun directe dienaren en de demonen wonen in de laagste helse werelden die zijn ook afgesloten zodat zij ons niet meer met hun kwaad kunnen besmetten onze eigen wereld ligt op het laagste hemelse niveau maar wij mogen reizen naar hogere hemelse werelden hoewel het kwaad dus geen directe toegang meer heeft zijn er nog steeds mensen die zich niet aan de goddelijke wetten wensen te houden voor de ergste vergrijpen wordt hen de onsterfelijkheid weer afgenomen in het begin werden misdadigers daarna vrij gelaten maar de goden hebben later toestemming gegeven om de verworpenen als slaven te gebruiken zij worden keer na keer herboren in een nieuw lichaam en zij vergeten hun vorige bestaan totdat zij gezuiverd zijn van hun tekortkomingen blijven zij dienaren maar ze kunnen hun burgerschap weer terug verwerven bijvoorbeeld in de arena zoals satyr
1128243 ik heb altijd gehoord dat mensen na hun dood naar de hemel gaan of naar de hel als ze heel slecht zijn
1128244 je hebt ons al veel verteld over jouw thuiswereld aarde we wilden het niet zeggen want je houdt echt van die plek maar waar jij vandaan komt is voor ons de hel jij komt van een van de afgesloten werelden en jij bent de eerste bezoeker die daar in duizenden jaren vandaan komt wat ze je verteld hebben klopt niet ares jullie zielen gaan niet naar de hemel als jullie sterven maar jullie worden keer na keer herboren in die verschrikkelijke wereld ik heb je leren kennen als een nobeler mens dan vele burgers hier toch ben jij voor ons een duivel die thuis hoort op aarde met zijn oorlogen hongersnoden ziektes aardbevingen en overstromingen
1128245 de aarde is niet alleen maar slecht we hebben kunst en wetenschap en muziek we hebben de slavernij afgeschaft we hebben de verenigde naties wij zijn geen duivels en jullie zijn geen engelen we zijn gewoon allemaal mensen ik hoor hier niet ik weet ook niet hoe ik hier terecht gekomen ben maar dat heb ik al zo vaak verteld
1128246 ja hoe jij hier komt is nog steeds een raadsel en die ring van jou is een nog groter raadsel de magistraat heeft bovendien ontdekt dat jij geen koningsring draagt hij had mij gevraagd om hem jouw ring te brengen als je dood was en hij sprak over een meesterring ik heb dat nagezocht volgens de oude legende waren de goden zelf ook ooit sterfelijk en zij hebben machtige ringen voor zichzelf gesmeed uit de essenties van verslagen oermachten als jij echt een meesterring draagt dan bevat die dus een bijzondere kracht en dan doe je er goed aan om die kracht te leren gebruiken
1128247 gij zijt satyr niet langer uw naam is simon uw burgerrecht hebt gij gewonnen vandaag hier is uw recht uw vrijheid

1128250 you see it was the only workers i could get
1128251 our local council are committed to promoting recycling and providing a good refuse collection service they believe and i agree that bin taxes are a step in the wrong direction in the fight to minimise waste and could in fact encourage fly tipping
1128252 you must be the change you wish to see in the world
1128253 you see it was the only workers i could get
1128254 oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
1128255 you see it was the only workers i could get
1128256 ik ga proberen om aan de ontwikkeling van het voetbal en de sport in het algemeen te blijven werken
1128257 de benzeenconcentraties op 500 meter van de brand zijn lager of gelijk aan de europese richtlijn 2010 de tolueenconcentraties liggen lager dan de norm van de wereldgezondheidsorganisatie
1128258 nadat ik de programmas van real madrid en het nederlands elftal nog eens goed had bestudeerd kwam het besef dat ik gezien de vereiste fysieke inspanning om op dit niveau maximaal te presteren een keuze moest maken
1128259 de combinatie van enerzijds de competitie beker en champions league wedstrijden van real madrid en het programma van het nederlands elftal anderzijds is voor mij een te zware belasting er rest mij dan ook geen andere keuze
1128260 uiteraard ga je bij dit soort beslissingen niet over n nacht ijs ik heb met oranje een heel fijn ek achter de rug en kijk daar met een goed gevoel op terug
1128261 ik heb uitvoerig met ruud gesproken en wil en kan niet anders dan zijn besluit respecteren natuurlijk vind ik het spijtig dat ik bij het samenstellen van de oranje selectie geen beroep kan doen op zijn kwaliteiten en internationale ervaring
1128262 barack and i as partners as friends and as lovers we accessorize each other in many ways
1128263 the best thing i love having on me is barack on my arm and vice versa whether its having him standing there smiling at me or watching him mesmerize a crowd or talk to some seniors in a senior center
1128264 my first job in all honesty is going to continue to be mom in chief
1128265 making sure that in this transition which will be even more of a transition for the girls that they are settled and that they know they will continue to be the center of our universe
1128266 tack on the fact that there is no sustained mental health support for these families as they are struggling with loved ones who are coming back dealing with emotional issues
1128267 youve got people in pain and we dont hear those voices a lot
1128268 i found it wasnt that barack wasnt interested in helping
1128269 its just that when the baby cried at 4 a m i got up faster than he did because i would hear the baby and i would be up

1128273 this ruling sent shock waves to every corner of the media landscape
1128274 with the stroke of a pen the appeals court has effectively taken the availability of dvr like function from 25 of u s households to almost 50 of u s households
1128275 in essence every existing digital cable box in america becomes a dvr
1128276 other cable operators have said repeatedly in the past that if cablevision wins this case they will follow
1128277 the person who actually presses the button to make the recording supplies the necessary element of volition not the person who manufactures maintains or if distinct from the operator owns the machine
1128278 cablevision more closely resembles a store proprietor who charges customers to use a photocopier on his premises and it seems incorrect to say without more that such a proprietor makes any copies when his machines are actually operated by his customers
1128279 de operatie is op zich geslaagd maar er is een complicatie opgetreden bij dit soort operaties is het gevaar van infectie altijd aanwezig en dat is in dit geval jammer genoeg inderdaad gebeurd het was natuurlijk een heel vuile wond en een gecompliceerde operatie wij zijn meer dan acht uur bezig geweest uw zoon heeft een infectie opgelopen met mrsa dat is de bekende ziekenhuisbacterie hij heeft nu hoge koorts en is nog niet bij kennis hij ligt nog op de intensive care in isolatie en hij kan geen bezoek ontvangen want het besmettingsgevaar is te groot

1128288 oil is down but its because global growth is slowing the panacea that people thought a decline in oil would be has not come to pass
1128289 now the bear market is rolling on to energy commodity and tech stocks
1128290 with crude oil and gold down there seems to be a wave of selling in the commodity fertilizer stocks there is a general feeling that the worldwide economies are slowing
1128291 actually i like the ending i liked how the guy got the girl

1128316 the suspect was only in the store for a matter of seconds maybe a minute but not very long at all
1128317 we dont know exactly how long it was that the clerk was in there before the customer found him
1128318 i was so excited when found out that i would have the opportunity to work with them on designing a line i grew up shopping at urban outfitters
1128319 the main causes of halitosis include overactive bacterium near the back of your tongue gum disease and some medical conditions such as liver failure bronchial infections lung infections and diabetes
1128320 you beings on earth who are in deep slumber awaken who among you has labored to turn darkness into light and bitterness into sweetness
1128321 must be ready to code a patient on a seconds notice as our patients are so sick so my kids must be ready to jump in right away
1128322 something happened that i pray not to see again we are all children of god and none of us are too good to sit with anyone
1128323 how do we validate the data we expect to get
1128324 when the hiv and aids pandemic began in the early 1980s the overarching goal of education was to give people hope and the goal of treatment was to prolong life
1128325 despite the incredible strides we have made what this study shows is that some people are rejecting life saving treatments because they fear the side effects of the medications that could potentially save their lives while others on treatment have unnecessarily resigned themselves to live with side effects and poor tolerability in an age where less toxic treatment options are available patients can and should now expect more from their hiv treatment
1128326 atlis results indicate there is still a strong need to educate hiv positive patients and the world around them the findings demand an increase in global hiv and aids literacy
1128327 it is critical that we empower hiv positive patients to take an active part in the management of their disease by educating them on the importance of adhering to their treatment and teaching them about the innovations in treatment that could improve their overall quality of life
1128328 despite the progress we have made we are not on course to meet universal access targets and in fact appear to be slipping away from our existing commitments
1128329 it appears that we are poised to accept defeat when victory is still within our grasp our failure to meet those commitments will have an impact on millions of lives this cannot be allowed to happen it is time for nations to live up to their commitments
1128330 with only two years to go until the 2010 deadline for universal access set by world leaders we must redouble our commitment to scaling up all proven hiv prevention strategies
1128331 the fact that last year 2 7 million people were newly infected with hiv a disease that is entirely preventable is unacceptable
1128332 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
1128333 the responses to hiv and aids require long term and sustained financing as more people go on treatment and live longer budgets will have to increase considerably over the next few decades in the most affected countries donors will have to provide the majority of the funding
1128334 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
1128335 we must categorically reject any attempt to so called normalize aids or treat this epidemic as just one of many medical problems
1128336 aids is the most complex the most challenging and probably the most demanding infectious disease humanity has ever had to face
1128337 we dare not let down our guard we are going to be in this for the long haul
1128338 many of us want to be doctors or teachers i want to be a singer but these dreams will only be possible when we have medicines when were accepted in schools and when we can grow up in an atmosphere free from violence stigma and discrimination
1128339 there has been a spectacular advance but we are still very short of the mark
1128340 one of the tasks of the conference is to address the fact that there are three million people who now get the drugs but another nine million who do not
1128341 after so much progress it appears that we are poised to accept defeat when victory is still within our grasp
1128342 i dont believe for a moment this could break the bank there is a humanitarian necessity of investing in prevention
1128343 hiv has spawned an interest in health systems that was never there before and investment in hiv is helping to drive the expansion of public health systems globally to reach all those who need it
1128344 no doubt that in order for us to achieve the 2010 universal access targets health systems must be further strengthened
1128345 stigma discrimination and human rights would indeed be the focus of the conference
1128346 we are in an interesting and some would say difficult period
1128347 there has been a sense that every vaccine trial is do or die
1128348 most people dont understand that the product development process is rife with failures the assumption is most candidates wont work we are just looking for any signal of hope
1128349 s omething like prep has a good chance of becoming available before we have a 100 efficacious vaccine
1128350 the challenges are a little less daunting if we have that tool it could have a very big impact
1128351 continue to face discrimination isolation and criminalization for hiv transmission
1128352 the conference is a place to exchange opinion but now only those in power have a say
1128353 over 95 of people living with hiv are not transmitting to someone else in a given year
1128354 what that says is the transmission rate has been kept very low by prevention efforts
1128355 i think the new statistics are the most important aids story in the u s since the advent of the new treatments
1128356 stable number of new infections in a world that has got more and more people with hiv and people with aids living in it suggests that we are keeping up with that pressure for transmission
1128357 science based aids prevention means having access to accurate data about how many people are becoming infected
1128358 less and less money to actually get hiv prevention programs to the communities that need them
1128359 been scrutinized by some of the best statisticians in the country and is much better now than when we started this process
1128360 its important to note that the new estimate does not represent an actual increase in the number of new infections but reflects cdcs ability to more precisely measure hiv incidence and secure a better understanding of the epidemic
1128361 fact remains that there are far too many people becoming infected in the united states every year therefore these findings should be a wake up call that the epidemic in the united states is far from over
1128362 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
1128363 demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health
1128364 we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
1128365 work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids
1128366 by focusing efforts on reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach we as a nation can make great progress in fighting hiv aids
1128367 means little if it does not serve as the spark to inflame our collective anger about the deadly neglect of an acute emergency
1128368 there is absolutely no good news here without an accurate picture of the epidemic vastly underestimated for the last 10 years we have missed countless opportunities to intervene with effective public health strategies
1128369 confirm that aids in america is a black disease and has been neglected for far too long
1128370 eleventh hour intervention of aids activists and educators with the assistance of a few state lawmakers
1128371 stronger infrastructure of community based organizations vying for the funding
1128372 when you look at the proportion of services on the south side of hartford compared to the north side it doesnt break out evenly
1128373 we dont have a strong african american based agency advocating for services in the north end all that is going to rest on the entire community to take action
1128374 if it werent for the few watchdogs that we have the african american community would definitely fall off the radar there is a disparity in the accessibility and its our fault too there was a national mandate by the cdc to test african americans but that didnt happen
1128375 bouncers and public health authorities there is wide acknowledgment that drug addiction and sexual activity are common among women who perform
1128376 theres a lot of drug use lots of oral vaginal sex going on in the clubs
1128377 the same people who sell them today at u s 60 did not all the sudden have a conversion where they said im being greedy and now ill be generous they charged that because they had a small volume with a lot of fixed costs
1128378 now because of the unitaid funding there is a big volume with absolutely certain payments so they can charge a small profit margin on each individual lifesaving medication
1128379 if you look at the rising price of petroleum the rising price of food around the world we are all going to have to re examine how we produce food where we produce it how we consume it
1128380 its not just a question of energy prices its not just a question of global warming its a question of how we are going to keep our kids alive
1128381 it is possible to honor the world health organization treatment guidelines in my opinion only because of unitaid and the government of france
1128382 it may be the single most important contribution of france to the rest of the world since the end of the second world war
1128383 problem is not with the procedure but the way it is abused by men so that men think they are now immune from
1128384 people think the disease originates with women why because it is the women who are tested first when they are about to give birth
1128385 introducing the procedure there was insufficient attention given to cultural factors attitudes and human psychology
1128386 many of the men i speak with think circumcision is like an aids vaccine its not its a useful tool to reduce chances of infection at a time and place where few other tools are available but you can still contract hiv and pass it on to a partner
1128387 until that happens women will be infected with hiv this way and male circumcision may do more harm than good if it is misused to deny women full protection
1128388 great fear that the gains made to reduce the prevalence of hiv in kenya would be lost
1128389 with time well start feeling the impact of this conflict on hiv and aids
1128390 we cannot wait for the study results to begin to prepare for the optimal use and delivery of prep
1128391 instead we should look ahead to consider all of the possible outcomes of these trials and make real plans for making prep available to those who can benefit from it as quickly and safely as possible if it is proven effective
1128392 cannot shy away from discussing issues such as potential drug resistance the difficulty of adhering to a once a day pill regimen for people who are hiv negative or the cost of providing prep
1128393 trends in hiv and std related risk behaviors among high school students united states 1991 2007
1128394 its easy to lose sight of the fact that the news on aids is more good than bad
1128395 anger that the u s government seems more interested in fighting the disease overseas than among african americans at home
1128396 aids advocates have a tough time acknowledging good news because they dont want donor nations to get complacent
1128397 d onors and recipient countries are still doing plenty of things wrong
1128398 doing plenty right too and for that they deserve more credit than they usually get
1128399 tens of billions of dollars have been pledged to combat aids yet donor countries have largely overlooked the role of nutrition somehow ignoring both the scientists and the beneficiaries
1128400 the donors have been asked for help often enough and there are united nations and nongovernmental organization projects out there to fund but they are not getting the cash they need to provide good nutritious food to people
1128401 micronutrient deficiencies often plague hiv infected adults and children and they can only be ended with diversified diets fortified foods or supplements
1128402 as food prices soar poor families are already substituting less nutritious foods for meat fish eggs and vegetables
1128403 poorest families are being forced to choose between food and medicine for loved ones
1128404 food itself as necessary for healing and not just for those affected by aids or tuberculosis
1128405 it is time to change the way we help drugs alone are not a solution for aids or tb
1128406 what doctor would admit a patient to a hospital give them the most advanced medications and then leave them to starve
1128407 from the ground up building comprehensive hiv aids care programs in resource limited settings
1128408 robust domestic aids agenda sensitive to the needs of all communities and relevant to the cultures of hispanic communities

1128410 the idea was to bring some historical entertainment for people so they can kind of get a snapshot of some of the historical sites in wilmington and also get a taste of some of the local restaurants as well

1128412 as part of our annual august model year clearance we are leveraging the move from leasing to retail purchases to offer our customers the best deals of the year and make buying as affordable as renting
1128413 we have re packaged our incentive spending typically spent on leasing into retail purchase packages to lower monthly payments on select vehicles from the dodge caliber and dodge charger to the chrysler town amp country and jeep liberty with the model year ending on 2008 vehicles the time to buy has never been better
1128414 pathfinder continues to stand out as an innovative rugged suv capable of handling adventures both on and off road

1128416 abell cluster 3627 is filled with a diffuse atmosphere of hot gas which surrounds all the galaxies in the cluster eso 137 001 is moving through this gas as it plunges toward the clusters center the entire galaxy therefore feels a sort of hot wind in its face
1128417 the wind pushes raw star forming gas out the back of eso 137 001 creating the comet like tail where orphan stars are born
1128418 eso 137 001 is special however because the rate of orphan star formation is so high 36 to 5700 times greater than anything weve ever seen before
1128419 a few billion years from now these stars will be in a pretty lonely region of space
1128420 planets circling orphan stars may be less affected by the occasional comet of death perturbed out of its orbit by gravitational interactions with a passing star
1128421 this is a great day for the science of radio astronomy and the study of the cosmos
1128422 thanks to a unique intersection between the best in science advanced innovative technology and bold philanthropy many secrets of the universe are a little closer to being revealed
1128423 this project represents a potential breakthrough in building large arrays of radio telescopes that are extremely cost effective
1128424 as now deployed and with plenty of room for growth in the future the telescope can fulfill a multitude of uses including broad radio sky surveys and the search for evidence of extraterrestrial technology im pleased to be able to contribute to such an important advancement and help build on the work this new telescope will do in the future my hat is off to the team that worked so hard these last seven years to accomplish this significant milestone
1128425 for seti the atas technical capabilities exponentially increase our ability to search for intelligent signals and may lead to the discovery of thinking beings elsewhere in the universe
1128426 it is the first major telescope in the world built specifically for undertaking a search for extraterrestrial intelligence
1128427 many of the musicians who play here recognize that american music is a melting pot with many styles drawing from the musical traditions of their irish scottish english and african heritages

1128432 cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all
1128433 in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the vod context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing
1128434 this decision is a great victory for innovation technological progress and consumers rights
1128435 the content industry in suing cablevision once again overreached in its goal to limit the personal uses of increasingly popular technology
1128436 we hope this case will be another signal to hollywood to scale back its attacks on consumer friendly technologies
1128437 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
1128438 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
1128439 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
1128440 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
1128441 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done

1128450 we know how to do it we should do it now
1128451 however we see a lot of association between asthma and acid reflux in the 15 million americans who have asthma as many as 50 to 80 percent also have acid reflux
1128452 we do know that reflux can cause asthma if the reflux is aspirated into the lungs or the acid in the esophagus can cause chest tightness also if acid gets into the bottom of the esophagus it can reflux up against the bronchial nerve which causes the airways to narrow and a shortness of breath
1128453 my patients will say oh that tightness in the middle of my chest isnt there anymore
1128454 when a patient thinks of reflux they think of heartburn or regurgitation and they arent aware of the other atypical signs
1128455 its not uncommon anymore to get referrals from allergists and pulmonologists
1128456 sometimes surgery is needed to tighten up the esophageal sphincter which prevents the reflux of acid
1128457 this is the first experimental evidence in a controlled laboratory setting linking these two very common conditions in humans
1128458 these data suggest that chronic micro aspiration of gastric fluid can drive the immune system toward an asthmatic response
1128459 this does not mean that everyone with gerd is going to develop asthma by any means
1128460 but it may mean that people with gerd may be more likely to develop asthma if there is an upside to this it is that developing gerd is something we can pretty much treat and control

1128485 certainly it was a big step to win your first tournament
1128486 at that time it entailed an invitation to the tournament of champions i dont remember if that was a full year exemption or not at that time but it put me pretty well into position where i was going to finish on the money list in such a way that i would be exempt it was a big step in my golfing tournament career
1128487 what are your recollections of playing the tour in the 1950s and early 1960s
1128488 i think the players then were probably a closer knit group in that there was a lot of travel by car
1128489 there werent the outside opportunities to do outings and we all showed up at the golf course for practice rounds a lot of times we shared cars for driving we even shared rooms i dont think you see much of that out there now and because of that situation some very close friendships were developed
1128490 i think the best description was he was a very private person an example i try to give to exemplify that is we were invited to his home maybe five or six players palmer souchak to dinner at his home at shady oaks which was in the late 50s it was about a 4 000 square foot home as i remember he had one bedroom one bedroom

1128531 the person who actually presses the button to make the recording supplies the necessary element of volition not the person who manufactures maintains or if distinct from the operator owns the machine
1128532 cablevision more closely resembles a store proprietor who charges customers to use a photocopier on his premises and it seems incorrect to say without more that such a proprietor makes any copies when his machines are actually operated by his customers

1128657 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1128658 unfortunately senator obama continues to oppose offshore drilling he continues to oppose the use of nuclear power these misguided policies would result in higher energy costs to american families and businesses and increased dependence on foreign oil were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires

1128664 the number of sub standard refillable gas cylinders in circulation in the country has also reached alarming proportions hence we deem it necessary to organise this stakeholders forum to sensitize both the manufacturers and end users
1128665 when the world is running down you make the best of whats still around
1128666 there are things you can do individually though to save energy
1128667 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
1128668 why me basically the only thing going through my head i was more shocked than anything didnt understand what was going on
1128669 patient requests not to be released because they will kill me tonight
1128670 i said howd you know that they said you are beaten anybody who comes up here and looks like you comes from yonkers
1128671 you have an assault by a good squad and then assault by the district attorney
1128672 if every garage mechanic and driver knew the details and was involved in the planning of the attack it never would have happened
1128673 you must decide the weight and significance if any such statements deserve
1128674 it is attention that has significance for the war on terror
1128675 i just heard that they possibly spotted the rapist and they have the area sealed off
1128676 i open up the door and i see police running around

1128679 ill keep it in my house look at it every time i leave the house
1128680 im at a loss just like many of my friends are
1128681 shock is my initial take on this disbelief that anyone would accuse father harris or father wally as we would call him would ever accuse him of such a disgusting and vile act
1128682 at this moment its two more victims who are getting a bit of justice

1128685 barack obama directly intervened in last decembers presidential election in kenya supporting fellow luo tribesman raila odingas candidacy despite an agreement odinga signed to back radical muslims according to an explosive new book written by wnd senior staff reporter jerome r corsi when obama decided to support odinga corsi noted obama embraced the extreme left wing of kenyan politics going back to raila odingas father odinga odinga known as double o who was overtly communistic during the presidency of jomo kenyatta odingas current party the orange democratic party or odm is a leftist socialist political party that stops short of being openly communist
1128686 in formulating his iraq policy sen obama seems to value ideological consistency above military victory
1128687 by detaching his policy from any future factual analysis sen obama would create a dangerous situation in which he would be obligated to reduce the u s presence in iraq even as those reductions were endangering u s forces and allies in the region as well as the government and people of iraq

1128692 the other thing we thought about was moblin one wasnt successful in creating this community push having a vibrant community push is the winning factor
1128693 so theyre like if you are feeling like youre ready to act we want to give you a platform we want to help you once they figured out that i was serious about it they totally helped me do it they went all out for their girl
1128694 a lot of times when i meet people for the first time i think they are taken back by how warm my energy actually is because they watch the shows and they just figure me to be this nasty angry negative person but what it was is that i had a lot of things coming at me i had girls to compete with and then i had guys in my house who were there for the wrong reasons you have to know i got that way because my buttons were pushed if im not on the battlefield fighting any battles im going to put my swords away so im good

1128700 oh you mean that mac os x thing so if i got two windows a and b on space 1 i put window b in front focus then i go to space 2 then back to 1 woops now a is in front of b and this is the newest version of the os released this year linux got this right 10 years ago

1128704 games are different from other art media because of their interactivity
1128705 so if a game is expressing something and doing it well then you shouldnt be able to understand that thing from screenshots because the meat of the expression should come from the interactivity
1128706 s ince we had medals built into the existing game the programming team could just tie the existing 47 medals into the trophy award requirements
1128707 choosing 47 medals during our initial development worked better than imagined because the 47 trophies with the appropriate point values for bronze silver and gold trophies perfectly equaled the maximum number of trophies that can be awarded
1128708 since medals and trophies are essentially the same anyone who has played uncharted already knows what they have to do to get any one trophy if youre a better gamer than i am and worked to get all the medals before then you already know what all of the hidden trophies are
1128709 a person will get well when he is tired of being sick

1128711 there are many different kinds of users that prefer different choices therefore we need to support all of them

1128722 we realised that if it becomes difficult to move goods services and people from one end of the city to the other lagos cannot be said to be a favoured investment destination
1128723 it was the same roads that served the state since 1975 that were still there it is the same shopping malls tejuosho was built in the seventies and so was falomo the number of schools did not increase the number of hospitals did not increase the number of football fields remained the same
1128724 therefore we realised that roads must work waterways must work and rail transportation must and will work in lagos
1128725 the only way that economy will continue to thrive is if it is able to support humanity support business and support investment an investor is looking for returns on investment and for there to be investment returns there must be competitiveness prices must beappropriate

1128732 el hecho de cancelar esa posibilidad a los normalistas egresados es cancelar igualmente el derecho a la educaci n de los alumnos

1128747 it does not look like the driver was at fault
1128748 at this point it does not look like any charges will be filed

1128759 tecs ability to provide the warfighter with a superior knowledge of todays complex and ever changing operational environment depends in part on a productive marriage of our geospatial tools talent and military geospatial business logic with complementary commercial geospatial information technology
1128760 our partnership with esri allows us access to powerful software database systems and architectural concepts critical to our continued success as an army geospatial knowledge center

1128763 estos casos se replican con un patr n similar a los ocurridos en la d cada de los a os 70 lo que hace que el estado mexicano sea puesto en la mira internacional por situaciones que parec an superadas sin duda estas pol ticas de seguridad y de militares en la calle han generado el regreso a ese tipo de violaciones graves a los derechos humanos

1128903 my mind is made up dont confuse it with facts
1128904 i have cleaned the dock with compressed air vacuum toothbrush and whatever other small things i could get my hands on
1128905 make sure there is no lint moisture or other debris in the dock connector port on the iphone
1128906 get a hair dryer and run the air through the connections on the top remove your sim and bottom the part that plugs into the docking station of your iphone for 5 10 min take care not to over heat the iphone too much
1128907 i had the exact same problem with my 1st iphone i took it back to the apple store and they replaced it right away
1128908 a while back a coworker of mine told me he had to pop out the sim and put it back in to fix that error on his phone i dont see how that could be the cause but what happened in his case was that he dropped his phone and that message came on reseating the sim fixed it in his case maybe it got knocked loose might be worth a try
1128909 ive also seen reports that plugging and unplugging headphones in will remove this issue ymmv
1128910 i have the same problem after having the iphone in my bathroom the message appears almost every 4 seconds i think some condensate got into it
1128911 finally found on a apple forum that lint can build up on the connector dock or cable and cause this error to pop up all time try cleaning the connector using keyboard air spray or was the cable and connector pieces that should do the trick
1128912 spent about five minutes with a needle cleaning out the dock and the dock connector i also blew on them a lot problem solved i would assume if certain pins arent making contact the iphones not sure what its plugged into but as long as the two or three pins carrying the power supply make contact it will still charge correctly so in short just clean it a little it wasnt too bad
1128913 it is likely the error is caused by a shorted circuit in the dock connector i have sourced a replacement dock connector and a company that will do the replacement
1128914 americas major metro regions may be on the verge of transit independence
1128915 almost every time he analyzes a group waber discovers that the super connector the crucial person who routes news among team members isnt the manager the manager is almost always peripheral waber says its some random guy and that person is usually overworked and overstressed he isnt given enough support to fulfill his role because nobody in the firm knows hes doing it in the first place if you study the org chart the higher ups are in control but if you study reality those same managers barely know whats going on

1128940 the limits to future petroleum supplies have more to do with politics than with geology and resource availability for example the most promising acreage remaining in the u s is located offshore most of which is off limits to the industry

1128946 the move from cpl to gpl can be seen as either more restrictive or less restrictive
1128947 just what does it mean for bluedragon to change its licensing model to dual licensing using gplv3
1128948 im not sure exactly but its free and open source so that must be good right
1128949 we are looking at a license exception that would basically exclude anything that might constitute a graphical theme for the site
1128950 what if i decide to commercialize a plug in would i need to sell a full commercial license of the farcry core with it as well
1128951 the problem is that currently a plug in would be either bound by gpl or if you develop it in conjunction with the commercial license it would be bound by something else

1128965 we know from basic economics that historically if the number of market makers declines auctions will not be as efficient and this will lead to higher financing costs for the u s government
1128966 in less capital stressed times market makers would not be as concerned about price but with the amount of bond inventory they have to push dealers will seek concessions on price and that means higher financing costs for the government and the taxpayer
1128967 right now given the decline in dealers the preferred situation would be a small federal budget deficit but that is not the case we have a large deficit so we have a supply demand double whammy the federal government will have to work extra hard to find buyers of its debt which undoubtedly means increasing the interest rate paid a higher borrowing cost which the taxpayer pays

1128971 de combinatie van enerzijds de competitie beker en champions league wedstrijden van real madrid en het programma van het nederlands elftal anderzijds is voor mij een te zware belasting er rest mij dan ook geen andere keuze

1129037 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1129038 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1129039 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1129040 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month

1129051 i found it wasnt that barack wasnt interested in helping
1129052 its just that when the baby cried at 4 a m i got up faster than he did because i would hear the baby and i would be up
1129053 but for us its a friendly competition chris and i are roommates and josh is a friend of mine the media likes to make a bigger deal out of it than it really is were just out there having fun competing and doing something we truly enjoy
1129054 i wouldnt say right now anybody has a legitimate lead
1129055 i would say we have a 1 a and a 1 b with turner and steffy then no 2 is portis by no means am i saying hes out of the hunt but there is a difference between those two guys and him in understanding how to run the offense
1129056 offensively the big question is at quarterback and who will be that quarterback
1129057 we may play multiple quarterbacks i dont know its an area that if we can get the production we expect we have a chance to have a good offense
1129058 i definitely think everyone can contribute in a different area but were all competing to be the quarterback not one of the quarterbacks
1129059 it was a crazy time there was a lot of excitement basically i just never looked back
1129060 after that it was kind of my job i still feel like its my job that if i play my game ill be all right but ive got two quarterbacks behind me fighting for the job well see what happens
1129061 i started no three and ended three maybe this year ill start first and end first only time will tell
1129062 i like being on top i do feel like i should be on top after last season but its a competition

1129186 clinicians and policymakers should understand the evidence but individualize decision making to the specific patient or situation
1129187 even if one or both ultimately demonstrate a population level mortality benefit however individual screening decisions will still need to be made by weighing the benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening and treatment
1129188 these harms are especially important because some men with prostate cancer who are treated would never have developed symptoms related to cancer during their lifetime
1129189 there is also adequate evidence that the screening process produces at least small harms including pain and discomfort associated with prostate biopsy and psychological effects of false positive test results

1129227 they set the boundaries at the start of the season this is whats going to happen if you muck up but theyve gone too far now

1129230 i see it as a real positive for our playing group and our club to have somebody of bens standard as a footballer to set an example on the training track and its great for our young players coming through
1129231 ben really wants to be a part of the playing group he really wants to get back into the club environment and wants to see where hes at from a footballing perspective
1129232 garys been great with our on field support but as for off field gary doesnt know whats going on inside the footy club
1129233 ive got together a terrific group of board members who are very very capable in their area and they know whats going on inside our footy club far more so than gary ever will
1129234 so for people that think gary is in there pulling strings or in the background its not true its inaccurate
1129235 right now the way im feeling is if we played a game right now against st kilda if st kilda players roughed him up and were into him at the first bounce im not too sure if id go over there and support him to tell you the truth
1129236 im pretty confident we can more than compensate for heath with a different player this week but bugger him

1129262 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1129263 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
1129264 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on
1129265 for this reason the sanction imposed will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held on tuesday
1129266 i rang him and then i saw him walking down and then because there was a bit of a crowd around me i just told him to go because i didnt really need him there at that point

1129268 democrats offered a real solution to high energy prices that would bring immediate relief within 10 days by forcing the president to free our oil from the nations stockpile the republicans propose to give away public lands to big oil which will not immediately reduce the price at the pump and save americans only 2 cents 10 years from now this republican hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to reduce the price at the pump and promote energy independence
1129269 im a bit cautious about that being in the eight i just think you can get too excited because you get absolutely no prize whatsoever for being in the eight after 21 rounds
1129270 i dont think we were totally dominant i think we lost our way a few times but we did enough to win
1129271 it was a memorable game for me because of the occasion and it was nice for the club because were up there in the eight but it wont go down in history as one of the exciting games as far as quality was concerned
1129272 i think we have to play a lot better if we want to keep our season alive
1129273 we knew that if the team lost tonight it would make it a lot harder for them but it still doesnt make it insurmountable to make the finals
1129274 but in the end you dont get to write those scripts either

1129276 once inside he interestingly bypassed the lobby and ducked down a side stairs to go to the bottom floor to catch the elevator up rather than taking the elevator in the main lobby he went out of his way not to be seen
1129277 after we confronted him about seeing rielle edwards looked like a deer caught in headlights
1129278 he was clearly surprised that we had caught him at this very late hour inside the hotel
1129279 some guests up at this late hour watched the spectacle in amusement from a staircase nearby
1129280 anyone who knows me knows that i have been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years
1129281 the innuendos and lies that have appeared on the internet and in the national enquirer concerning john edwards are not true completely unfounded and ridiculous
1129282 now that it seems to have blown wide open rielle may get her wish all she wants is for john to marry her and for them to live happily ever after with their baby shes tired of running and living a lie

1129578 and then what got me was jimmie johnson theyd committed to coming so i was like well well go ahead and come but if bob would have said stay out thats what we would have done but i think we were both about 51 percent on the come in side and neither one of us were going to argue but the argument came when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming he said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea so thats where the argument came

1129614 some media accounts have suggested the efforts of groups like the north carolina family policy council advocate bullying
1129615 this could not be further from the truth the council fully supported the senate version of the bill because it did not contain a provision adopted by the house that listed specific categories including sexual orientation and gender identity or expression
1129616 the insistence to keep sexual orientation in the bill is what ultimately led to its demise

1129637 we simply cannot pretend as senator mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem we need a much bolder and much bigger set of solutions we have to make a serious nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away

1129694 he cant buy me the way he buys his cheap groupies i said i wasnt going to watch any more of his movies and i meant it
1129695 its dash riprock dash riprock sitting in the same restaurant as i am i knew he grew up here but i never thought hed come back i have to go over and say hello
1129696 now dear the man is trying to eat his dinner in peace at least wait until he gets to his dessert
1129697 what if he skips dessert what if somebody else recognizes him and i miss my chance no i need to go over there now he grew up a few blocks from my cousins sisters boyfriends bus driver that makes us practically neighbors but dont worry ill be polite
1129698 mr riprock sir its an honor to meet you i cant believe youre actually here dash riprock action hero and movie star sir i am one of your biggest fans
1129699 liked it i loved it and it was so believable too when you discovered that the popes illegitimate son was actually the evil mastermind behind the plot to corner the market on solar power boy i didnt see that one coming
1129700 well its been nice meeting you i always like to talk to a fan but my dinners getting cold thanks for coming over to talk to me and ill see you at the movies
1129701 it was great to meet you too im sorry for interrupting your dionner and thanks for talking to me youre awesome
1129702 i went over to talk to him and even though he was obviously trying to enjoy his dinner he took a few minutes to chat with me about his movies and he even gave me a couple of hints about the next one i knew he was a good guy guys from around here dont go hollywood they remember where they came from i cant wait for the next movie to come out
1129703 he bought our dinner even though i interrupted his dash riprock is aces in my book
1129704 does god have that same priority at the top of his list

1129732 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
1129733 we need to offshore drill for oil and natural gas
1129734 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires

1129738 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1129739 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1129740 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1129741 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month

1129752 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been 30 years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1129753 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them
1129754 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power
1129755 the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea two months ago is a slide in his poll numbers

1129761 for decades the medial temporal lobe structures have been linked to both memory and spatial cognition
1129762 so we set out to test how these two abilities related to one another and to the temporal lobe area of the brain
1129763 we concluded that the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are not essential for path integration since we showed that the tests could be successfully accomplished despite damage to these brain regions
1129764 because many prostate cancers grow slowly early detection may not benefit a patients health and in some cases may even cause harm

1129766 epidemiologic observations of sex differences in the onset and course of schizophrenia prompted exploration of estrogens role in schizophrenia
1129767 estrogens neuroprotective and psychoprotective actions may be mediated by a variety of routes ranging from rapid actions including antioxidant effects and enhancement of cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose utilization to slower genomic mechanisms which may include permanent modification of neural circuits
1129768 the lack of effect for negative symptoms is consistent with literature reporting that negative symptoms are less responsive to treatment than other symptoms of schizophrenia it is possible that longer term treatment is required for negative symptoms to respond to treatment alternatively brain regions implicated in negative symptoms may be less responsive to gonadal hormone effects
1129769 estrogen treatment is a promising new area for future treatment of schizophrenia and potentially for other severe mental illnesses
1129770 the recent push for school vouchers in georgia reminds me of the attempt by wealthy special interest groups to influence the georgia supreme court race two years ago in this race a highly respected judge carol hunstein was challenged with well funded attack ads 1 3 million of which were paid for by a group from washington called the american justice partnership however voters proved not to be as gullible as the partnership thought they were and re elected hunstein

1129773 campaigning at town halls across america i am often asked about my plans to reform our public schools and the answer begins with two points on which most everyone agrees every public school child deserves a first rate education and too many of our schools are producing second rate results beyond that the education debate divides quickly into two camps
1129774 leaders of the los angeles unified school district have much to explain about how a 3 2 billion bond proposal considered perfectly adequate two weeks ago more than doubled in size pumped up with blurry references to future unspecified projects and they wont have to explain that just to voters but possibly to the states lawyers school bonds which can be used only to fund construction and equipment not staff or textbooks got much easier to pass in 2000 when voters amended the state constitution to allow 55 approval rather than the previous two thirds
1129775 were small and were best explained by common genetic factors with opposite effects on exercise behavior and symptoms of anxiety and depression
1129776 in genetically identical twin pairs the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the co twin who exercised less
1129777 it is unknown which genes might be involved in voluntary exercise behavior and in the risk for anxiety and depression
1129778 only voluntary leisure time exercise is influenced by genetic factors whereas the other type of exercise directed and monitored by someone else is environment driven the absence of causal effects of voluntary exercise on symptoms of anxiety and depression does not imply that manipulation of exercise cannot be used to change such symptoms
1129779 the antidepressant effects of exercise may only occur if the exercise is monitored and part of a therapeutic program
1129780 yet despite the traditional prominence of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice and training there are indications of a recent decline in the provision of psychotherapy by u s psychiatrists a trend attributed to reimbursement policies favoring brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapy and the introduction of newer psychotropic medications with fewer adverse effects
1129781 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
1129782 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
1129783 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
1129784 a key challenge facing the future generation of psychiatrists will likely involve maintaining their professional role as integrators of the biological and psychosocial perspectives while working within the constraints of the strong market forces of third party payers and managed care to implement advances in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders
1129785 although the precise mechanisms are currently under investigation the association between short sleep duration and overweight may be attributed to the interaction of behavioral and biological changes as a result of sleep deprivation
1129786 given the fact that the prevalence of overweight among children and adolescents continues to increase and chronic sleep insufficiency becomes more prevalent in modern society family and school based sleep interventions that aim to enhance sleep hygiene and increase sleep duration may have important public health implications for the prevention and intervention of obesity and type 2 diabetes in children
1129787 furthermore our results demonstrate an important relationship between rem sleep and high bmi and obesity suggesting that the short sleep obesity association may be attributed to reduced rem sleep time and decreased activity during rem sleep
1129788 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1129789 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1129790 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people

1129802 the implicit is not contained in the explicit as such
1129803 there are many revelations but the final revelation is made through a person who while bringing us new truths is also himself the truth the revelation culminates in jesus christ in jesus christ the word of god himself enters into our history to make us children of the father and to bring us with him into the inner life of god
1129804 that revelation was closed at the death of the apostles is because they received a complete message to which no increase could bring further riches we cannot get beyond jesus christ for he is the truth and the apostles have been charged to tell us not only this or that truth but

1129882 no such violence can take place without political failure and injustices
1129883 in our country the hindutva forces too use such rhetoric for their own political purposes terrorism is a political response to a political situation it would be futile to look for its roots in any religion as hindutva is not a product of hinduism but that of a right wing hindu political party jihadis are not a product of islam but of politics of right wing muslim outfits in principle our democracy should keep religion at a distance from governance and politics should be based on secular issues pertaining to people
1129884 even after independence and vivisection of our country we never shed our communal outlook and politics our politicians were hardly made of secular democratic stuff and our administrative machinery was hardly any different our politics was never based on soci0 economic justice and the naxal problem is an outcome of gross socio economic injustices
1129885 there are several muslim families who fought the british during the indian freedom struggle we are proud that we belong here but why are we forced to prove our patriotism after every terror attack we also want to know why very often innocent young men are rounded up and harassed after every bomb blast in the country just because they happen to belong to a particular community
1129886 it is necessary that our courts recognize that the religion based harassing conduct that took place in this workplace culture is as offensive as other forms of discriminatory harassing conduct outlawed in this state

1129891 the whole issue of political correctness has gone too far when it comes to the criteria for determining an offensive comment
1129892 if anybody is offended then its offensive the criteria has become much too personalized it only takes one person being slightly upset at something for it to become offensive
1129893 hostile environment harassment takes a variety of forms many factors may affect this determination including 1 whether the conduct was verbal or physical or both 2 how frequently it was repeated 3 whether the conduct was hostile and patently offensive 4 whether the alleged harasser was a co worker or a supervisor 5 whether the others joined in perpetrating the harassment and 6 whether the harassment was directed at more than one individual

1129896 frequently their only contact with the healthcare system is during a hospitalization
1129897 we know that not being engaged in care and prevention services is not only bad for the individuals but is also bad for society in that a substantial fraction of hiv infected crack users engage in behavior that transmits the virus to others

1129899 more needs to be done to address substance abuse and mental health in this population
1129900 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
1129901 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
1129902 there may be some underlying chemical changes in the brain that prompt alcoholics to report more insomnia as a co existing condition than non alcoholics
1129903 a possible explanation of these new findings is that the gabapentin might decrease the insomnia initially and the patient may not need or crave alcohol as a treatment for the insomnia were also looking into other factors that may have an effect on the neurochemistry of the brain and see how they could impact recovery and sleep
1129904 these results raise more questions for us to explore including the potential impact of gabapentin on people who are in recovery from alcohol dependence but do not report insomnia

1129928 while some studies have found an association between these antiretroviral treatments and increased risk of cardiovascular disease we believe our findings should reassure clinicians that using antiretroviral therapy over time does not appear to put patients at greater risk for coronary atherosclerosis and may in fact be more beneficial than we had initially thought
1129929 when we first prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy for hiv in 1995 we were concerned about how these drugs changed lipid levels in patients and whether they would increase atherosclerosis and ultimately lead to serious heart disease
1129930 while some studies have found an association between these antiretroviral treatments and increased risk of cardiovascular disease we believe our findings should reassure clinicians that using antiretroviral therapy over time does not appear to put patients at greater risk for coronary atherosclerosis and may in fact be more beneficial than we had initially thought
1129931 this was not surprising since these are the major risk factors for atherosclerosis in the general population
1129932 the purpose of our study however was to investigate whether long term haart usage was a major risk factor
1129933 these results could be due in part to lower lipid values of hiv infected men prior to beginning antiretroviral therapy and high use of lipid lowering drugs the key is that controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis should be a priority
1129934 what remains to be determined is whether use of the newest antiretroviral therapies confers an even better outcome and whether lipid lowering therapies will further improve cardiovascular risk in the hiv infected population our future research will address these questions

1129953 his statistical approach has led to what he says is a radically new interpretation of 20th century art one he is certain art historians will hate it is based in part on how frequently an illustration of a work appears in textbooks
1129954 almost unanimously refused to acknowledge the value that quantitative methods could have in their field
1129955 i dont see the method as anything except circular the frequency of an illustration doesnt seem to me to really explain what makes an idea good
1129956 somewhere along the line youve got to find answers to why its so interesting
1129957 its bad if you think of r only in terms of v and forget about t and a

1129970 pitching will be the no 1 point of emphasis to make us competitive on a consistent basis

1129972 i dont want to lose any quickness but i also want to be able to post up this coming year i think that would be a good thing to add to my game if i can take smaller guards into the post i did a lot of that in high school against box and ones and that is something i want to get back to
1129973 i like kevin jones game he works really hard and has been working hard for most of his career darryl and ebanks are pretty good players too
1129974 jones likes to get shots up on his own but his ability to knock down the open jump shot is impressive
1129975 when he played the first night in pittsburgh he really didnt do anything outside of his game he didnt force anything but he ended up with like 25 just from making open jump shots that is something that will stretch the defense out real good

1129981 everybody thinks theyre so wonderful and tolerant but look how they treat the gypsies
1129982 in a country where people in small towns still habitually leave their doors and windows open to air the house when they go somewhere they tend to get upset when bands of petty thieves come through
1129983 how can you say that how can you call them thieves
1129984 uh i dont know give me a hint is it because they take things that dont belong to them
1129985 i realize that and in our culture we lock people who do that up the gypsies understand that why dont you and do you know how gypsies treat their own who steal from other gypsies they exile them for life so why is it that every culture is allowed to defend their ways except us
1129986 question i needed something hearty and comforting pasta fit the bill i turned to my trusty spaghetti meat sauce which is one of the first things i learned how to cook so i knew i wouldnt have any trouble making it

1129988 this is great does this dessert perchance have any flour in it or insert any obvious ingredient
1129989 oh well it is so so delicous but i recently made a promise to myself and that promise was to only eat fair trade flour you see those poor flour workers have such terrible work conditions immune and gastrointenstional problems from their work that i have made a vow to only eat fair trade im sorry but perhaps you could give me the recipe so delicious

1129996 harbor no fright your family is waiting and ill be all right
1129997 but isnt there something i can do at the least
