5590000 i know this does not make sense to you but im doing it anyway moreover i will not explain it all to you but your responsibility is to trust me
5590001 ok lord i have no idea what you are doing but i trust you my life is yours do with it what you will
5590002 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5590003 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5590004 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5590005 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5590006 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5590007 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5590008 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5590009 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5590010 we say join the club it makes us feel old too
5590011 dont bother me i havent had my morning coffee yet

5590013 it is not fair to take the childrens food and throw it to the dogs
5590014 but even dogs eat the scraps from the masters table
5590015 this is not the last this is just the start
5590016 give yourself a nice cussion of cash and retirement income
5590017 personally i save about 10 each month for retirement 20 as liquid cash for everyday needs and another 40 for investing this may sound very demanding especially with regard to national media marketing investments but in actuality it is really a reflection of what you want for your future not necessarily what you want now
5590018 my top tip is making baby steps before giant leaps
5590019 by starting slowly your risk factor is greatly diminished and financial commitment is much lower you can get out at any time with minimal losses or move forward into more risky national media marketing areas with good fundamental knowledge
5590020 we want all of this to be simple and risk to be nominal the main area in which people have difficutly is assessing their wealth and risk factors far too often we see national media marketing investors jumping into a portfolio that is far too aggressive the end result can be disasterous invoking many to file bankruptcy
5590021 i invest heavily in areas that look promising but also proportionately balance my risk by putting some money in standard investments such as stocks bonds and money market funds
5590022 the motivation to have money from a national media marketing portfolio in the future is great
5590023 but dont forget that you cant live in the future forever many people fall into the trap of not meeting basic needs in the present which logically means that their future will become progressively more difficult
5590024 make national media marketing investments work for you and retire wealthy
5590025 were looking at the long term here quick wins are for lotteries and penny poker games not the national media marketing investment market i think given enough time those who invest in this area will see good returns for their national media marketing money
5590026 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games
5590027 i believe that online casinos can thrive in the east if they are marketed correctly that means outstanding customer service a realistic gaming experience and good deposit options

5590030 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities

5590055 musharraf is an intellectually dishonest person he is a clever ruler who makes the us and the west believe that they can only effectively deal with al qaeda as long as he is in power

5590060 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere
5590061 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5590062 all of us in new york hollywood and across the country should be concerned about how this failure to reach an agreement is impacting our members
5590063 they have already suffered significantly as a result of the writers guild of america strike and now they are experiencing an additional loss of work made worse when they can find a job by having to work without a contract under old terms and conditions
5590064 there are some who feel we have all the time in the world to make this deal
5590065 this advisory motion is not in the best interests of new york division sag members or any sag members across the country

5590067 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures

5590076 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5590077 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5590078 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5590079 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
5590080 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
5590081 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
5590082 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
5590083 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
5590084 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
5590085 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
5590086 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

5590093 the bus was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge at the bottom and from what i can see at the scene that bus has not managed to go round the bend and has careered through a wall and down a drop into a garden
5590094 theres a bus in a difficult situation which crews have had to secure and obviously the crews are working very hard in difficult circumstances
5590095 i heard this massive crash rumble of either crunching metal or what sounded to me initially as a thunderstorm as it was heavily raining before
5590096 then after that we heard shouts and screams so we obviously put it down to a crash
5590097 when i got to the scene there was a bus overturned it looked like it had ploughed into a car and then down a neighbours driveway into the garden
5590098 it must have dropped about 20ft 6m it was on a slope its diagonal not head first
5590099 there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus there were many walking wounded all being seen to by the ambulance staff
5590100 its a narrow country road its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour of rain just before it happened
5590101 i was in the local pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets
5590102 we all went to help but the area had been cordoned off by police
5590103 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry but theres really nothing i could do
5590104 i didnt feel right when i was warming up before the race
5590105 i knew my foot would fail me i felt painful when i was just jogging
5590106 i wanted to hang on but i couldnt it was unbearable if i had finished the race i would have risked my tendon i could not describe my feeling at that moment
5590107 i know i have the ability once my foot recovered
5590108 now the most important thing is to heal my injury i still have a chance next year after all im still at the peak i must be optimistic and i shouldnt blame everyone and everything but not myself i will not easily give up
5590109 we all understand that liu quit the race due to injury
5590110 we hope he will relax and focus on recovery we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory
5590111 love the glory love the pain love sport even when it breaks your heart
5590112 i still came out with the w and thats all that matters to me

5590115 i give coach terry brands the credit for training his mind and body to know he was going to be here one day and hes here a lot sooner than a lot of people thought hes a kid who always thought he could be special and a world and olympic champion

5590156 so many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security conformity and conservatism all of which may appear to give one peace of mind but in reality nothing is more dangerous to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future the very basic core of a mans living spirit is his passion for adventure the joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon for each day to have a new and different sun
5590157 some people feel like they dont deserve love they walk away quietly into empty spaces trying to close the gaps of the past

5590439 reports about this have been limited because journalists either dont fully recognize the strategic significance or they are afraid of hezbollah
5590440 almost no western journalists have reported this and only a few lebanese have
5590441 hezbollah is establishing layered defenses north of the litani in the southern and central bekaa and they have reinforced their presence in southern beirut
5590442 they also have created new positions in mount lebanon and in the far north near the highest peak of the cedars mountains which means technically hezbollah which means iran controls the highest ground in the region south of turkey
5590443 hezbollah knows that he who controls the mountains consequently the mountain passes controls all of lebanon
5590444 hezbollah is also telling itself i am afraid the israelis will attack me north of the litani so i will strengthen those positions above the litani and i am not allowed to have my weapons and missiles south of the litani so i will move them north
5590445 youve just got to tell them thats not true hes a christian

5590462 we firmly believe that a transparent and credible media industry is vital to the health of the world democracy

5590482 unfortunately the labor party cant even agree to dig uranium out of the ground and sell it to the rest of the world he said
5590483 weve had the labor party and prime minister kevin rudd for some ridiculously stupid reason refusing to sell uranium to india to help its domestic nuclear power industry
5590484 my view is we will need both sides of politics thats the labor the liberal and national parties to jointly support the development of a nuclear power industry
5590485 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect fire an officer in the isaf media office in kabul said
5590486 according to our reports about 30 taliban tried to attack the salerno base they were fired at we have found six bodies which were all wearing suicide vests he said
5590487 some of them have blown themselves up others are hiding in nearby houses and corn fields the troops are searching for them he said
5590488 absent any further appeals we expect the restructuring to close by sept 30 2008
5590489 it is a fair expectation that somebody is going to apply for leave to appeal
5590490 its an issue of national importance which is the primary ground the supreme court of canada looks to and they also look to the issue of whether theres a conflict at the appellate level which we clearly have in this case
5590491 all were doing is getting ready as soon as we reasonably can to close this transaction we dont know whether there will be an appeal or not if there is an appeal we will deal with it
5590492 on the other hand we have a lot of clients that need their money so well do the best we can to move this forward as fast as possible
5590493 people who sold the paper to the potential appellants to do whatever they can to arrive at a reasonable settlement with them
5590494 the reality is that some of them the upset investors are damn lucky they didnt win the appeal here because they begin to realize theyd be a hell of a lot better off with the restructured paper
5590495 in a very very small minority of cases in which its asked for in this case you have two decisions of the ontario court approving the plan and a very strong decision from the court of appeal today
5590496 i was extremely relieved to hear that the ontario court of appeal not only dismissed the appeal but did so in a unanimous way
5590497 i think were done here and should be moving forward
5590498 lets just drive on and dont hold us hostage any more

5590577 the information we have is very scant and comes from employees at the store who reported seeing the children in the vicinity of the dumpster in the past two weeks
5590578 it appears they may have been sleeping in the dumpster
5590579 according to store employees the children are two boys aged about four and six years old and a girl aged about nine years
5590580 we are trying to do the best thing for them and we dont want them to think they are in trouble but we have to treat it as serious
5590581 we are hoping that they are most likely from a home nearby but we dont know what their home situation is like and therefore have to speak to their parents
5590582 the child jumped up and both of them were shocked
5590583 they have cleaned the bin and placed a mattress in it
5590584 inside is always neat and tidy and the bed is usually made perfectly
5590585 at first we thought the kids were just playing in the bin but they are there during the day with no adult and you just wonder why they are dressed the way they are and why they are not at school it is so sad
5590586 for the time being we have got the local waste company to halt bin collections at the store inspector blain said the children were last seen in the area on saturday
5590587 we have had the area under surviellance and have been conducting patrols at night but they have not turned up we are hoping that they will return to the area he said

5590625 animators and game designers have a good idea of natural motion but for ux designers this is a real challenge
5590626 we have to learn how to use that motion effectively motion is a really powerful tool we can use as designers but the real art is using it judiciously by finding the appropriate amount of real world physics and applying them on the screen
5590627 silverlight expression studio and the windows presentation foundation really throw this challenge out to designers
5590628 silverlight 1 was all about play pause stop video experiences whereas silverlight 2 is about representing and surfacing complex data
5590629 silverlight 2 provides opportunities to display rich data in deep and meaningful ways it really comes into its own by providing a way to collapse and coalesce the amount of data collected by rfid quickly and in different ways
5590630 we have to see what we can pull off in the next few weeks
5590631 the rest of the work is in what information do you want to surface and how to surface it sic

5590634 what a marvellous performance by geraint and the british cycling pursuit team to secure the gold medal to break the world record in doing so after they broke it to reach the final is absolutely outstanding
5590635 i really want this to be about making the delegate experience better
5590636 its new technology so people are always going to be wary to some extent but the fact is we cant track delegates from satellites we cant even track them more than six metres from an antenna
5590637 were also limited by the laws of physics people moving through a conference are vastly different from boxes moving along a production line where you can control speed spacing and direction
5590638 these are some of the fun and games scenarios weve been playing around with
5590639 weve now got an application that we can plug any hardware rfid device into
5590640 in fact the fixed and mobile readers all interface into the same system technology and code base this means that if im from an rfid world i can build out a mobile rfid component without too much upskill or needing to reprogram in a separate language
5590641 each door is manned by its own local system which can be run in isolation these also drive the displays in each room
5590642 we did our initial processing with a centralised model but our concern was if the network went down we still wanted to be able to read people going in or out of the doors so we settled on 34 localised rfid server systems
5590643 we want to dispel some of the myths about rfid
5590644 we want to inspire people to get to rooms quickly and get seats when they see them filling up in real time
5590645 we also want to really inspire them to see what can be done with our application stack out of the box and get them thinking about rfid beyond traditional supply chain applications
5590646 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
5590647 the situation has been improving quite a lot tension in the area has ceased and we hope that the situation will go back to normal as soon as possible

5590654 looking at the strong growth prospects of all its verticals we recommend a buy with a target price of rs 594 at the target price the stock would be valued at 18 0 x fy09e eps of rs 32 99 implying an upside potential of 18 5

5590656 my game has been pretty good all summer but i just haven t put it all together
5590657 it was not unexpected i felt i could do it
5590658 so many people have been worried and caring about me i feel sorry i could do nothing but pull out of the race
5590659 i didnt feel right when i was warming up before the race
5590660 i knew my foot would fail me i felt painful when i was just jogging
5590661 two weeks ago i ran a 12 90 something i didnt know why things turned out this way i wanted to hang on but i couldnt it was unbearable if i had finished the race i would have risked my tendon i could not describe my feeling at that moment
5590662 i am not that type of person i never quit easily i believe i will come back
5590663 we are very close to deciding to send the prime minister for the closing ceremony of the olympics to be participated by many foreign dignitaries
5590664 because there were so many people supporting me i told myself i had to run but i just couldnt do it

5590693 were spending 4 000 a second to be there while they have 70 billion in a new york bank account from oil
5590694 i believe iraq should take some responsibility and use their money to build their infrastructure while we bring our money home and use it to build ours
5590695 its a tragic tragic loss of lives for our loved ones but they need to know that their lives will not have been taken in vain
5590696 why is it that the same people who bemoan constantly the cost of insurance in this state are the same ones asking for more mandates
5590697 our family has tightened our belts and i believe government should do the same
5590698 i want to take the expertise that ive learned at the state board of regents where we stress accountability and accessibility and bring that to the county commission

5590704 illegal immigration might be perfectly all right 50 years from now but for now it doesnt seem like a good idea its a strain on our educational resources strain on medical resources strain on police resources
5590705 most of us grew up hunting and deer hunting when we were kids so you sort of learn how to sit and be quiet and you learn to observe and listen
5590706 its almost a classic invasion of one country from another
5590707 because most of them are catholics they overpopulate their country so they have extremely poor living conditions so people want to get out of there and they want something better so they move into their neighbors country and eventually they overrun the neighbors country

5590710 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5590711 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5590712 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5590713 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5590714 the 3d body scanner accurately extracts hundreds of measurements of the human body including volume in six seconds and removes a potential source of measurement error the human experimenter
5590715 it is widely believed that human beings are attracted to one another as a result of genotypic and phenotypic quality in other words their prospect as a mate who will yield higher quality offspring for the chooser
5590716 my previous research suggested that bodily symmetry is not necessarily what people attend to when they find someone attractive but nonetheless the physical cues that they do prefer may reveal an individuals underlying developmental quality i e degree of symmetry this new research identifies an explanation for the correlation between bodily shape and attractiveness your body proportions shape and stature are signals that conspicuously advertise your good development or health and therefore the degree to which you are a desirable reproductive partner in many species fewer departures from perfect symmetry are associated with good development health and reproductive success
5590717 to act as proxy diagnosticians by looking for evidence of particular deficits perhaps missing vital signs which may indicate other difficulties at home or with learning
5590718 children with learning difficulties and poor social skills will be diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder that may remain with them for the rest of their lives
5590719 if australia were to follow the racps recommendation to include adhd as a disability category eligible for additional support funding special education budgets for all australian educational jurisdictions would skyrocket
5590720 schools and educational systems will not be able to cope with the demand and as such each additional supported child will receive less
5590721 in the end children with significant disabilities cerebral palsy autism intellectual impairment will not receive the support they require and the segregation of students with high support needs will continue to increase
5590722 more educationally and fiscally responsible approach would be to provide targeted funding for which individual schools and teachers could apply to support their access to professional development in the area of inclusive educational practice

5590741 the complaints have mostly been about people going home at 2am causing noise not to mention fights on previous occasions
5590742 they said if the hours of opening were reduced it would adversely affect the business
5590743 our concerns were predominantly with the management of the premises particularly the management of people leaving the premises and the large impact that was having on people in the area
5590744 we heard a screech outside the next thing we knew there was rubble and chairs flying
5590745 when we went outside the truck was in the side of the pub
5590746 luckily there were only two people in the pub as we close early on sundays one was a paramedic so he was out of the door checking everyone was all right everyone was a bit shaken up

5590753 as the dust settles from the breakdown of the wto negotiations in geneva some parties are recognising that there was a good package of results left on the table zoellick said
5590754 it would be a mistake for the world economy and harmful for developing countries not to retrieve it
5590755 given the high food prices around the world and the need for poor people to lower their cost of food it just does not make sense for the doha negotiations to founder upon this barrier
5590756 since the purpose of a safeguard is to help cushion the effect of a significant increase in imports on local producers an acceptable justification for the safeguard could require examination of factors in addition to increased trade flows
5590757 a big problem with safeguards is that once a country triggers them it can take two years or more to challenge the grounds for imposing them he said
5590758 in the meantime the new barriers block trade so a compromise could create a speedy due process for challenges without appeal
5590759 it may be understandable that tired negotiators couldnt assemble these and perhaps other variables in a way to solve the problem zoellick said
5590760 the government of india is preparing and we have been preparing a proposal for the east asia summit to adopt that will happen at a meeting in december
5590761 after that the bill based on that will go to parliament and when the bill is enacted then we will start appointing and have different schools the building construction cant begin until there is a bill
5590762 the land has already been given by the bihar government they are also making an initial investment there would be some initial funding also coming both from bihar and from the government of india then there have been various proposals
5590763 it will probably be an international rather than national university happen to be located at the site of the old university
5590764 nalanda is a landmark in our civilisational journey and a revival of nalanda signifies an asian renaissance
5590765 the first university that came up thereafter was in balonia that was much later more than 500 years later when nalanda university was destroyed in the 12th century that was just about the time when oxford university was getting established
5590766 there were 10 000 students in those days residing in nalanda
5590767 economic growth has been sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices and weaker growth in exports
5590768 global financial markets remain unstable and there are downside risks to the world economy particularly the us economy
5590769 while growth will likely remain sluggish for the time being it is expected to return gradually onto a moderate growth path as commodity prices level out and overseas economies move out of their deceleration phase

5590780 the constitution says a thing can be expropriated in public interest

5590810 moreover such high efficiency of a nas appliance goes together with energy saving
5590811 compared with an average pc found on the current market instead of burning an outrageous 200w ds408 only calls for a relatively low power consumption of approximately 40w under normal operation with four hard drives installed

5590813 we can console ourselves with the fact that her legacy will be that she taught thousands of women and children throughout the world who have benefited from her work
5590814 she was an extraordinary young woman who was absolutely passionate and worked tirelessly for people particularly women and children all over the world
5590815 she would often be in war torn or disaster torn countries but she would helping to better their lives we are very proud of that
5590816 she was so focused highly intellectual and had a great capacity for hard work but when she came home to suffolk she would just slot back into family life

5590854 aisha was six or seven years old when betrothed to muhammad she stayed in her parents home until the age of nine when the marriage was consummated in medina
5590855 duncan you might also want to ask how it is that any jew can claim to oppose polygamy since a number of their greatest kings and prophets had multiple wives
5590856 and as bad as islam is in some ways its much better than the native arab pagan culture
5590857 a man can have sexual pleasure from a child as young as a baby
5590858 in june 2002 iranian authorities approved a law raising the age at which girls can marry without parental consent from 9 to 13
5590859 one thing about americans as this comment thread bears out we sure love prison rape
5590860 wow good on that girl if shes able to take charge of her life like this at 8 she could have a bright future ahead of her
5590861 do you have a way of ridding the world of assholes let us all know
5590862 you stay out of our business and well stay out of yours
5590863 bigamy consists in the having of two wives or two husbands at one and the same time knowing that the former husband or wife is still alive if any person or persons within the state being married or who shall hereafter marry do at any time marry any person or persons the former husband or wife being alive the person so offended shall on conviction thereof be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars and imprisoned in the penitentiary not exceeding two years
5590864 wouldnt we then have to call awful people colostomy bags
5590865 a man can have sexual pleasure from a child as young as a baby
5590866 in june 2002 iranian authorities approved a law raising the age at which girls can marry without parental consent from 9 to 13
5590867 sharia despite its shortcomings is at least based on evidence
5590868 considering that so many of the killers victims were jews themselves it is dubious how much if any killing was being deliberately targeted at
5590869 independent farmers ethnic minorities members of the bourgeoisie senior officers
5590870 considering that so many of the killers victims were jews themselves it is dubious how much if any killing was being deliberately targeted at
5590871 are you saying that you actually meant to cite different articles that are linked to the page containing the cited article rather than the article itself nope i never said that
5590872 ive found loopholes but still i have to go through third channels to get it done
5590873 banking restrictions have obviously harmed our business but they have never halted outside trade with iran
5590874 i wonder how its possible to impose unilateral sanctions against a country that has land and sea borders with 15 countries
5590875 we dont want to antagonize our neighbor iran or upset our friend the united states we dont want to get very close to america and at the same time distance outselves from iran
5590876 u n collective sanctions are binding upon all countries and the uae has a duty to obey them but sanctions by the u s or europe are not binding
5590877 we are not party to it and wont pay attention
5590878 some 40 years ago dubai was a village iranians were the first to settle here
5590879 i believe in evolution and i am shocked at some of the things that people in public life have been saying i believe that our founders had faith in reason and they also had faith in god and one of our gifts from god is the ability to reason
5590880 e volution is more grounded in my experience than angels
5590881 im a christian and i believe in parents being able to provide children with religious instruction without interference from the state but i also believe our schools are there to teach worldly knowledge and science i believe in evolution and i believe theres a difference between science and faith that doesnt make faith any less important than science it just means theyre two different things and i think its a mistake to try to cloud the teaching of science with theories that frankly dont hold up to scientific inquiry
5590882 from a personal standpoint i believe in evolution when i stand on the rim of the grand canyon and i see the sun going down i believe the hand of god was there
5590883 give unto science the things which are science and unto the ignorant masses the things which are god
5590884 scientists please understand that im with you on this but i need to pander to these people so that i dont look like the elitist dismissive asshole that the media wants me to be lately
5590885 wouldnt it be terrible if i quoted some reliable statistics which prove that more people are driven insane through religious hysteria than by drinking alcohol
5590886 i am free of all prejudices i hate every one equally
5590887 we get either far left or far right every time
5590888 people have known for years that children need to get the chicken pox its a childhood disease that you must have or potentially suffer greatly or die as an adult
5590889 but writing to educators and representatives about issues like these is certainly better than bitching about it on some blog message board agreed
5590890 when men differ both sides ought equally be heard by the public for when truth and error have fair play the former is always an overmatch for the latter
5590891 actually plenty of people take four heart medications at the same time its not unusual for an ace inhibitor a diuretic or a calcium channel blocker to be given at one time as well as digoxin or other inotropes for heart failure
5590892 which is worse screwing an intern or screwing a country
5590893 alas to wear the mantle of galileo it is not enough to be persecuted by an orthodoxy you also have to be right
5590894 the science right now is inconclusive but we have to research it lets find out the truth
5590895 an obama administration will go where the science and the facts lead us whether it is about climate change or toxic heavy metals in our environment
5590896 we need independent thorough and comprehensive testing of all drugs including vaccines to make sure that they are safe and effective
5590897 sorry charlie you cant separate the enfamil paycheck from the free samples from the barbie doll drug reps from the groupthink use any logic you want or rather just go read kuhn
5590898 its good to see that the lilly white supra supra research community is immune to the same pressures that have corrupted allopathy in the us i know exactly what kuhn means those who got their hands dirty down here in realityland see it first hand
5590899 i cant refute any of your argument based on the evidence and logic youve provided but you used wikipedia as a source so your entire argument is automatically invalidated 111111
5590900 when youve met one kid with asd youve met one kid with asd
5590901 im talking out my ass here and i want to sound like im authoritative
5590902 very few of these combinatorial therapies actually have the statistical support of the combination to believe them efficacious you may have sufficient data on each individual component but that does not imply efficacy for joint application
5590903 only if there are exactly two possibilities 1 the relationships between treatment and outcome are one to one and onto meaning a perfect correspondence every time and 2 the relationships between treatment and outcome are totally random meaning there is no predictable correspondence at all between treatment and outcome
5590904 im talking out my ass here and i want to sound like im authoritative
5590905 hey the repubs keep winning maybe we should try to be more like them
5590906 isaac asimov used to take kind of the mirror image of that argument in explaining why he was happy to pay taxes as the price to live in a civilized society basically he said that he was happy to pay for things like traffic lights to keep transportation running smoothly and social programs to help people who otherwise might get so desperate as to start taking from and destroying the society whose smooth functioning he was both dependent upon and part of
5590907 environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism or may be important in future research include certain foods infectious disease heavy metals solvents diesel exhaust pcbs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs and vaccines
5590908 on what basis is a non doctor justified in deciding that a doctor is wrong any ideas pharygulites
5590909 its not one of the side effects in my list
5590910 one of those people who have weird reactions to drugs
5590911 just give me a pill and let me get out of here
5590912 there are children and adults who truly have a disorder
5590913 libertarians imo take things too far but so do liberals
5590914 if social security is a simple accounting problem then why have all the recent democrats been espousing this
5590915 its not government that is inefficient in particular but bureaucracy when you scale up any organization you pay for the efficiencies of scale in certain aspects with other inefficiencies of scale so the trick is to find where in particular you can scale up and where you cant
5590916 surely you cant possibly believe something as simplistic as government always inefficient and business always efficient
5590917 thats the problem with a lot of hardcore liberals youre always ready to think the worst of your opponents
5590918 government bureaucracy is more inefficient than private bureaucracy again because when government is inefficient it just requests more money instead of failing and letting the gap be filled by a competitor government doesnt have to be extremely inefficient but it tends towards inefficiency because there is no mechanism as in free market to force it to tend towards efficiency
5590919 why should i work if im taken care of no matter what
5590920 markets always have a strong feedback mechanism consumers that punish businesses that dont provide what consumers want consumers choose between competing products and services on a day to day basis and they generally understand the products they are choosing from
5590921 if they play nothing but crappy shows or commercials then the consumers will tune into other stations and the advertisers will stop paying and the broadcaster will fail or their profits will go down prompting investors to question the existing management the point is the constant pressure is there during every quarterly report contrast government where the leaders are reelected every 2 4 or 6 years
5590922 either you dont watch tv or have lower standards than me i can only name 2 hours of television a week out of 24 7 500 channels that i dont find to be complete and utter crap its not that folks enjoy the crap particularly its just that they dont have to just put up with enough to satisfy the advertisers do people really want insipid pap no advertisers want insipid pap market discipline only keeps television from being too absolutely horrendous that everyone just turns it off
5590923 i can tell you that for every tv show you think of as stupid or insipid there is someone who laughs there ass off right along with the canned track
5590924 as for inefficient businesses you dont need to keep mentioning them i know theyre out there and some of them find ways to survive by and large i dont care though because individual consumers and investors are keeping said businesses alive if anything illegal is going on then let the government deal with it if they can
5590925 as for all the comparisons to other countries what does that demonstrate the american dollar was doing just fine for quite a while and now its not economies cycle whos to say that if those countries didnt become more capitalistic that their economic metrics wouldnt increase even more etc
5590926 when it comes to economic theory i really dont know anything im not convinced that you do either though
5590927 yes their choice is diluted compared to normal consumer purchases but so what the effect is still there if you try to deny that im going to reach through my computer and slap you what do you want government controlled tv i doubt it so what the hell are we trying to figure out here
5590928 the cell phone market sucks maybe it could be better than it is but i doubt the government could have stepped in and helped
5590929 now if we can identify cases where the free market is particularly inefficient or where we need to provide some level of guarantee health care then go ahead and invite the government in ahead of its time
5590930 any policy decisions would be guesses based on non representative situations market segments other countries
5590931 good for you now sit down shut up and find a desk job like everyone else your age
5590932 oh well i have lived life and you havent so youre just so naive as to how the real world works and how foolish of you to pursue this and that etc
5590933 well little girl i have lost that spark and that drive for life a long time ago because i thought that i had to and you still have it and that makes me mad and i want you to be just as unhappy and bland as i am
5590934 i am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in washington are over i have done more than any candidate in this race to take on lobbyists and won they have not funded my campaign they will not get a job in my white house and they will not drown out the voices of the american people when i am president

5590982 i have not seen them play with such a chip on their shoulders since the dream team of 92 especially with kobe bryant running the show
5590983 they have a different mentality they are trying to kill teams and they are going to try to knock us out with the first punch we have to stay calm we feel that if we play the way we can play play free we will do all right
5590984 what do we have to do to beat them shoot 100 percent

5591025 no one is paying attention to whats happening in gaza no one is listening to palestinians they are slowly being strangled by israel and no one is even listening we need to find ways to connect people in the middle east particularly young people to people and groups in wealthier countries together we can inspire each other and together we can be much more than we are alone
5591026 americans are terribly ignorant of the human effects of what they support i think this boat is one of the most effective means of raising consciousness particularly american consciousness about the problems caused by american foreign policy authors parentheses americans have to know the consequences of these policies im sixty four years old my children are grown and my affairs are in order i think about rachel corrie and about what israel may do to us i know its risky but i take a risk when i ride a motorcycle and i think that if were really going to change things then somebody has to begin putting something on the line for that change to happen
5591027 this mission is an amazing opportunity to have a huge impact on this hard locked heart locked crisis ive never been to gaza myself but i know that gaza is the forgotten little brother of the middle east or at least of the israeli palestinian crisis everything about this crisis is clearer in gaza the israeli occupation strategy is much clearer in gaza because its not specifically about taking more land its mostly about completely destroying a people

5591116 the sotg troops extracted from the area without further incident following the operation
5591117 mullah akhtar mohammed was a senior taliban extremist commander within oruzgan province who controlled a large force of insurgents and directed a strong campaign of intimidation and violence within his area of responsibility
5591118 it occurred in broad daylight making concealment of the patrol difficult it was in an extremely remote area of the province and mullah akhtar mohammed was difficult to pinpoint as he travelled within a very small group
5591119 importantly the sotg located him positively identified him and when it was confirmed that there were no non combatants afghans nearby accurately targeted him for the successful isaf airstrike

5591164 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
5591165 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
5591166 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
5591167 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
5591168 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
5591169 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
5591170 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
5591171 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
5591172 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
5591173 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
5591174 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
5591175 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
5591176 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
5591177 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
5591178 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5591179 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
5591180 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
5591181 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
5591182 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5591183 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
5591184 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
5591185 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
5591186 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
5591187 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
5591188 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
5591189 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
5591190 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
5591191 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
5591192 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
5591193 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
5591194 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
5591195 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
5591196 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
5591197 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca

5591211 the most outstanding personality in the history of the nation
5591212 they took everything from the houses and offices including chairs and dishes we hid in our basements during the bombing but during the massacre there were no safe places and we just ran in one direction
5591213 if the invaders did not like someone they just shot them without mercy
5591214 they were very aggressive at the beginning they were mostly drunk and still are but several days later they changed somewhat when i went out one russian soldier even offered me bread and cigarettes
5591215 they are now scared there is nothing left to rob and ransack and i heard a russian soldier telling his superior officer that nato is sending its troops to help georgians and they had better go soon
5591216 if you saw them in the daytime you would think that russians are quiet and do nothing bad but everything starts at night the russian soldiers rob the shops then drink wine all night and steal everything they can carry my friend living in the centre of gori and his family have also fled he has only left his elderly parent at home when he called his father he found he was crying loudly the russian soldiers broke down his door with machine guns broke into the house and started robbing the house when old people tried to resist the russians beat them

5591257 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5591258 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5591259 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5591270 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5591271 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5591272 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5591273 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5591274 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5591275 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5591276 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5591277 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5591278 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5591279 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5591280 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5591281 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5591282 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5591283 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5591284 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5591285 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5591286 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5591287 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5591288 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5591289 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5591290 no he corrido bien a pie no he tenido el d a he tenido problemas estomacales
5591291 we find this paper about sports betting from pigat pidgeon to be a strong testament to our industrys growth and potential it clearly outshines the detractors and any negative points
5591292 dahle allinder really put well when saying it aint over with sports betting until its over
5591293 and im with them all the way until its time to move on
5591294 i am a big fan of this sports betting paper it lays out the ground work for exceptional progress and investment in this sector personally im going to invest my own funds in project development
5591295 i never thought that sports betting would come this far i knew that investments from private individuals would surely come but from the major investment houses no way
5591296 speaking from a personal viewpoint i believe that the more we can get out of this time period the better
5591297 we can all look forward and predict financial success for all involved but that comes tempered with a bit of risk right now
5591298 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5591299 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5591300 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5591301 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5591302 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5591303 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5591304 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5591305 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5591306 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5591307 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5591308 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5591309 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5591310 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5591311 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5591312 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5591313 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5591314 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5591315 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5591316 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5591317 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5591318 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5591319 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5591320 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5591321 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5591322 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5591323 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5591324 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5591325 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5591326 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5591327 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5591328 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5591329 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5591330 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5591331 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5591332 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5591333 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5591334 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5591335 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5591336 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5591337 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5591338 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5591339 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5591340 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5591341 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5591342 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5591343 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5591344 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5591345 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5591346 wir vermeiden dadurch auch einen dauerwahlkampf und gleichzeitig politik stillstand vom fr hjahr bis zum herbst den sich deutschland nicht leisten kann
5591347 die fraktionsvorsitzenden der regierungsparteien sollten ihre gemeinsamen berlegungen dazu aus dem vergangenen jahr wieder aufnehmen denn sie h tten die erforderliche parlamentarische mehrheit
5591348 es ist deshalb auch nicht einzusehen warum das bisherige grundgesetzwidrige sitzverteilungsverfahren nochmals n mlich bei der wahl 2009 angewendet werden sollte
5591349 die fraktion die linke hat eindeutig eine gemeinsame position ich gehe davon aus dass wir diese auch gemeinsam bis 2013 tragen werden
5591350 wir sagen was wir machen und wir machen was wir sagen
5591351 ich werde an die einsicht aller appellieren den weg hin zu einem politikwechsel nicht zu behindern sondern die chancen die sich f r uns nun ergeben zu nutzen
5591352 tomara que aconte a normal enfrent la e aqui uma competi o ainda mais importante vamos brigar para estar no p dio vamos torcer uma pela outra
5591353 tenho condi es de saltar bem mais do que isso agora descansar e prestar aten o na minha corrida para ir bem melhor na final
5591354 quando duas pessoas est o com a mesma pontua o por que n o proclamar as duas campe s
5591355 acredito que o correto seria dar as duas medalhas mas isto minha modesta opini o o coi v as coisas de outra maneira
5591356 n o sei se algu m entende o que est ocorrendo
5591357 eu empatei mas suponho que n o querem mais isso
5591358 wir essen s igkeiten weil wir so muscharrafs abgang feiern aber auch wenn man uns jetzt mit gift f ttern w rde w re uns das v llig egal in diesen gl cklichen momenten
5591359 er ist v llig zu recht rausgeschmissen worden ich w rde es nicht so formulieren dass er zur ckgetreten ist er ist nur gegangen weil er sonst v llig erniedrigt worden w re aber das ist nur der anfang zu viele diktatoren sind schon gekommen und gegangen ohne dass sie zur rechenschaft gezogen wurden
5591360 dies ist f r uns jetzt die gro e pr fung es ist der test f r die koalitionspartner ob sie jetzt etwas zustande bringen k nnen jetzt n mlich hat die gro e quelle der instabilit t im land den pr sidenten palast verlassen muscharraf kann jetzt nicht mehr bestimmen daher ist das unsere gro e pr fung und wir m ssen sie bestehen
5591361 i think it would be a benefit for the public to know when the committee is meeting and to be able to see the information as the committee meets that ultimately will be presented in a report
5591362 how many people getting shot or killed is it going to take
5591363 if other people can shut them down why cant we
5591364 when these guys are robbing these places are they carrying out big bags of stuffed rabbits
5591365 of course not theyve got cash they have to know theyre paying out
5591366 everyone else around is at risk when theres a robber
5591367 its in our neighborhood in a lot of towns thats not the case here theyre amid our homes
5591368 there are some people that are pretty doggone tired of that and i think they have a reason to be

5591395 there is no foreclosure at the moment theres a notice thats been posted i dont really have any other comments there should be no real changes for the residents
5591396 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
5591397 that the obama campaign has chosen to portray me as a 9 11 truther just shows how sloppy and inaccurate the research going into their rebuttal was
5591398 let me make clear that i fully accept and endorse the conclusion of the 9 11 commission that the islamic hijackers who flew the airplanes into the world trade center and the pentagon were the sole cause of the attack
5591399 there is no credible evidence that the u s government had any responsibility in the attack and it is irresponsible to suggest otherwise
5591400 although judging from the opening couple of pages about what a drunk polygamist sob his father was i wasnt sure if it was about myth romney or obama
5591401 obamas rebuttal used as evidence for its claim a radio interview in which corsi discussed a story he was researching concerning the chemical analysis of debris from the twin tower collapse
5591402 i know from captaining my country and my club that people look to you not only in terms of leadership but your performance
5591403 you set the standard in many ways because people look to the captain and do not expect them to make mistakes

5591405 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached

5591408 there didnt seem to be any attempts to isolate the ward
5591409 the dncc has full and complete respect for the flag and all rules of display
5591410 the dncc community credentials incorporate patriotic design elements they do not depict an actual american flag the dncc has full and complete respect for the flag and all rules of display
5591411 it is in truth not for glory nor riches nor honours that we are fighting but for freedom for that alone which no honest man gives up but with life itself
5591412 we feel the city should be ashamed of this secret prison theyve set up
5591413 when im gone i wont be here anymore if you can imagine that i can
5591414 time to sit down shut up and think about god and wait for the hour of my rescue
5591415 whos going to love you when youre looks are gone
5591416 simon asks and it makes you laugh because its a funny thing to ask
5591417 a tear drop consists of electrolytes and salt the chemistry of crying is not concerned with blame or fault

5591420 and though i cant guarantee theres nothing scary hiding under your bed im gonna stand guard like a postcard of a golden retriever and never leave you til i leave you with a sweet dream in your head im gonna watch you shine gonna watch you grow there could never be a father who loved his daughter as much as i love you

5591428 the cw und das studio cbs paramount network televison haben beschlossen die neue serie 90210 nicht vor dem offiziellen ausstrahlungstermin der presse zu zeigen
5591429 la verdad es que al principio pensamos darla en adopci n con alg n matrimonio m s joven pero mi mujer entr en la habitaci n y la vio tan redondita que nos la quedamos
5591430 se necesita ayuda econ mica por supuesto pero lo que m s gente preparada que est pendiente que te diga si lo est s haciendo bien que te d confianza en que puedes hacerlo
5591431 en los a os sesenta se pensaba que los malos tratos eran algo que se transmit a de tal forma que si el ni o los hab a padecido con los padres tambi n los sufrir a bajo el mando de los abuelos
5591432 y su sentimiento de p rdida era menos traum tico
5591433 en algunas comunidades no se les daba ni un c ntimo cuando pasaban a hacerse cargo de sus nietos
5591434 entran a trabajar o los abuelos son ya muy mayores para hacerse cargo de ellos
5591435 sa es tambi n la tragedia porque qu hace una pareja de 80 a os con dos lebreles adolescentes
5591436 he empalmado dos generaciones mi nieta es igual que una hija s lo que te la han dado hecha la educaci n de un hijo siempre es dif cil y a m la experiencia de madre me sirvi para aprender yo siempre he pretendido que sepa que soy su abuela y que su madre era su madre pero la he educado como a una hija con obligaciones responsabilidades y toques de atenci n aunque ahora baso todo m s en el di logo con mis hijos era m s mandona
5591437 ah ya vas de abuela pero ella entiende que a los otros los veo mucho menos ellos se llevan un ratito y ella tiene mi vida entera
5591438 no se trata de hacerlo bien de mirar caso por caso y ver si efectivamente esos abuelos est n en condiciones de educar y criar al nieto los mayores ahora suelen pasar los mismos reconocimientos ex menes y entrevistas que se les hace a las familias ajenas que quieren acoger a un menor
5591439 la escasez de apoyos que reciben los abuelos acogedores que reclaman en primer lugar ayudas econ micas y despu s informaci n general sobre el acogimiento
5591440 estad sticamente la reunificaci n a partir de un acogimiento con abuelos es menor
5591441 parece una paradoja pero no lo es los padres de los ni os que viven con sus abuelos no sienten esa necesidad tan acuciante porque los ven recogidos en casa nadie se los ha quitado piensan sin embargo cuando est n con familias ajenas tienen un mayor est mulo para recuperarlos
5591442 los ni os han aprendido a vivir enganchados a la imagen desde muy peque os se han acostumbrado a quedarse tranquilos medio adormecidos frente a la pantalla del televisor esa atracci n puede llevar con el tiempo si no se pone un control a un uso excesivo de los juegos de ordenador
5591443 lo patol gico es el nivel de frustraci n y ansiedad del menor cuando no puede usar el ordenador o la consola el placer del juego es para l una necesidad imperiosa algo rentable que le sirve para mitigar el sufrimiento y la soledad
5591444 no hay que adjudicar a los chicos toda la responsabilidad los padres tambi n tendr n que interrogarse qu pautas est n transmitiendo a los ni os
5591445 los ni os pueden estar m s predispuestos gen ticamente a estos juegos son m s competitivos
5591446 el escaso control de esta herramienta perjudica la estructura de la personalidad del ni o y el contenido de estos juegos muchas veces resulta perverso
5591447 el juego considera cotidiano situaciones como acabar la vida del oponente y es muy peligroso para el menor cuya personalidad se est formando adem s crea una sensaci n de omnipotencia y de fortaleza en el ni o que se puede extrapolar a la vida cotidiana
5591448 estos adolescentes est n acostumbrados a tenerlo todo aqu y ahora en las consultas no les puedes dar un no por respuesta no saben esperar
5591449 en la terapia cognitiva conductual deben intervenir los padres para reorganizar los tiempos del menor intentamos que el paciente comprenda su problema y se le planifica otras actividades
5591450 es el campo de entrenamiento de los juegos de azar y las m quinas tragaperras

5591722 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5591723 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5591724 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

5591726 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5591727 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5591728 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5591729 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5591730 ich gehe fest davon aus dass es vorher noch zu einer einigung kommt
5591731 die ganz gro en spr nge wird es nicht mehr geben

5591738 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5591739 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5591740 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5591741 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5591742 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5591743 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5591744 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5591745 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5591746 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5591747 saat puasa pasangan suami istri tentu saja tidak diperbolehkan berhubungan seks mulai dari azan subuh sampai azan magrib tiba lepas dari waktu itu mereka boleh berhubungan seks kapan saja
5591748 mereka yang berpuasa lebih sering kehabisan energi ketika akan berhubungan intim makanya mereka pun berusaha keras mengatur waktu sebaik mungkin untuk menyenangkan pasangannya masing masing jika hari hari biasa pasangan suami istri bisa bercinta setiap hari mungkin selama puasa mereka cukup berhubungan intim seminggu sekali
5591749 it may be biased to view the deal as going against nuclear non proliferation efforts
5591750 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5591751 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5591752 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5591753 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5591754 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5591755 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5591756 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5591757 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5591758 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5591759 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5591760 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5591761 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5591762 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5591763 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5591764 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5591765 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5591766 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5591767 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5591768 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5591769 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5591770 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5591771 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5591772 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5591773 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5591774 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5591775 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5591776 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5591777 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5591778 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5591779 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5591780 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5591781 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5591782 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5591783 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5591784 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5591785 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5591786 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5591787 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5591788 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5591789 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5591790 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5591791 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5591792 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5591793 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5591794 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5591849 historic best quarter both in terms of financial and operational performance
5591850 similar to the results for the first quarter of 2008 our results for the second quarter reflect the continued successful implementation of our profitable rapid growth strategy we achieved marked growth in sales that is a combination of accelerated organic growth in our core activities at a considerably higher rate than the growth rate in our industry and the contribution of the seven strategic acquisitions made in 2007 which were successfully merged into our global activity the continued trend of improvement to profitability is firstly due to the completion of most of the merger process of the acquisitions which according to plan began contributing already in the first quarter of the year not only to sales growth but also to the improvement in profit and margin and secondly due to the steps we took to adjust our products selling prices to the price rise in raw materials used in our production
5591851 frutarom will continue to act resolutely to achieve ongoing high profitable organic growth of our core activities to adjust the companys selling prices to price increases in raw materials used in production if they should occur and to concentrate on guarding and improving margin levels frutarom will also continue to strive to achieve optimal efficiency from the seven acquisitions made in 2007 and to extract and maximize the many cross selling opportunities in the acquisitions made in recent years we are satisfied with the rate of organic growth and the seven acquisitions that we made in 2007
5591852 frutarom will continue to invest considerable effort and resources in the continued implementation of our rapid growth strategy and in seeking and performing additional strategic acquisitions in order to continue strengthening our position as one of the global leaders in the field of flavors and unique ingredients

5591891 in the past six years nick and i have led the company in its growth into a leading wireless value added services and wireless media company in china
5591892 i am very proud of what we have achieved and this success simply would not have been possible without a team of talented experienced and dedicated management personnel and employees and the steady support and guidance we received from the board however i believe this is the right moment for me to transition to a less active role with the company in order to spend more time with my family and on other personal interests which i have not been able to do in light of my daily responsibilities at the company
5591893 on behalf of the company i would like to express deep appreciation for the leadership dedication and vision that yunfan my co founder has brought to this remarkable enterprise during his tenure as kongzhongs ceo yunfan has helped us achieve important milestones of good management and strategic positioning we are confident about the future of both our wireless value added services and our wireless internet business and are delighted that yunfan will stay on as the chairman of our board i will work with the board our management team and all of our employees to ensure a successful smooth leadership transition and maintain continuity in the relationships we have all worked hard to cultivate with telecommunications operators and our customers

5591931 we saw that there was a large group of people who werent able to enjoy traditional beers and were very excited that the release of gluten free golden ale will make great beer available to everyone
5591932 the most important part about developing this beer was to make something that tasted really good the fact that it is gluten free makes it all the more unique

5591935 mosport is a fantastic circuit of the old calibre which is steeped in history and happens to be one of my favourite circuits all the corners are very fast the track is very challenging for a driver the audi r10 tdi is very good at mosport even though you feel the high weight in the fast corners
5591936 detroit has an excellent layout and would be a fantastic race track if the tarmac asphalt was a little better there are not only the typical street circuit 90 degree corners but also interesting varied sections where one curve follows another and where the line must be perfect

5591952 if he wants to he can change flights he is a free man the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa
5591953 he is looking forward to coming back he is thinking about being free but worried about reporters he is ok but he is worried about his health he has problems with his hearing and his heart
5591954 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5591955 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5591956 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5591957 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5591958 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5591959 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5591960 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5591961 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5591962 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5591963 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5591964 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5591965 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5591966 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5591967 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5591968 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5591969 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5591970 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5591971 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5591972 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5591973 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5591974 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5591975 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5591976 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5591977 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5591978 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5591979 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5591980 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5591981 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5591982 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5591983 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5591984 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5591985 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5591986 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5591987 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5591988 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5591989 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5591990 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5591991 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5591992 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5591993 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5591994 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5591995 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5591996 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5591997 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5591998 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5591999 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5592000 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5592001 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5592002 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5592003 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5592004 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5592005 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5592006 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5592007 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5592008 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5592009 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5592010 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5592011 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5592012 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5592013 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5592014 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5592015 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5592016 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5592017 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5592018 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5592019 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5592020 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5592021 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5592022 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5592023 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5592024 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5592025 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5592026 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5592027 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5592028 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5592029 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5592030 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5592031 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5592032 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5592033 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5592034 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5592035 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5592036 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5592037 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5592038 this is a planning took where all things are going
5592039 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5592040 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5592041 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5592042 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

5592062 she was phoned up and informed this is a massive blow for her
5592063 i promise you im not breaking up kill that rumour
5592064 if you move the right foot forward and lean generally the left foot will follow and then you will be walking and the elevator can return to the upper deck
5592065 dont worry that happens a lot when people first arrive here i am robot 2 and i will escort you to cotar prime
5592066 oh yes of course we are jbb winner i am jeff and these are my daughters brittany and brianna we are writers and here to interview
5592067 come on we will stop at rayss and get some gelato you can interview me and then we will go directly to dr es lab and meet with cotar prime
5592068 number 2 why do you wear a lab coat and reading glasses robots dont need those things
5592069 ahh need and want an interesting question you are completely right i dont need them but i want them i like them they remind me of when i was in college many many years ago
5592070 no of course not i was a student at mit before the accident the strands and well all of this
5592071 the chocolate with the raspberry swirl is the best at least that is what i am told
5592072 let me give you a brief overview i was involved in a terrible accident in the brazilian jungle which left me completely paralyzed i could not talk or even blink my eyes a lot of bad things happened after that but that is a different story i was rescued by strand do you know who that is
5592073 yes he wears an exoskeleton rides a tomahawk cruise missile and had a bit of problem with the president of the united states
5592074 it was a big problem but nevertheless that is him he rescued me and gave me a new life the life i live now as the soul of the machines
5592075 strand inserted nano fiber strands directly into my brain those strands connected parts of my brain that were underutilized and allowed me to think a thousand thoughts at once as a part of that procedure i gained the ability to control machines with my mind the result of which is well me
5592076 exactly when i started to control the machines with my mind i was liberated from my paralysis i could exist and experience life i dont know how to explain it any better than that
5592077 i discovered that i could experience more of each facet of my personality if i separated my personas so i did robot number two is my humorous side and cotar prime is my serious side
5592078 so that is why you wear the lab coat and reading glasses
5592079 yes i spent many years wearing them and using a slide rule computers were very primitive at that time and not readily available
5592080 welcome jbb it is very interesting that you refer to yourself as a single entity even though you are three individuals we in contrast are one individual that refers to itself as three
5592081 i didnt realize brittany and brianna were identical twins one dna split into two beings i am mesmerized
5592082 natures clones do you know what the other is thinking
5592083 hmm maybe in the next set of books but for now we are science fiction writers and we are here to interview you not the other way around
5592084 i understand that you are also the soul of the machines you are the serious side and number two is the humorous side can you tell us what your name means
5592085 we are defined by the processes and experiences that create us would you agree with that
5592086 yes within the context of the decisions we make to be sure

5592308 we will ask the russian leadership it is their decision
5592309 i consider the government was not working effectively so i signed the decree to sack it
5592310 we have created an emergency commission to liquidate the consequences of the georgian aggression this is connected to the fact that several members of the government are incapable of acting in such a serious military situation
5592311 an international security mission should be deployed to help protect civilians and create a safe environment for the displaced to return home and international organisations should also send fact finding missions to establish the facts report on human rights and urge the authorities to account for any crimes

5592363 doing journalism at its most basic level is a combination of two essential tasks the first is reporting gathering information via research interviews etc the second part is telling your audience what youve learned writing in the broadest sense including video audio graphics and more and editing the demolition of the professional journalism business model has led to a sharp decline one i dont see slowing anytime soon in traditional media many people in the field have been asking an obvious question with a not so obvious answer who will do the serious journalism we need in the future

5592406 waren jullie de spot aan het drijven met allah en zijn tekenen en zijn boodschapper
5592407 en hij heeft jullie reeds in het boek geopenbaard dat als jullie de tekenen van allah horen en zij worden verworpen en bespot dat jullie niet met hen die dit doen blijven zitten totdat zij op een ander gesprek overgaan anders zouden jullie als hen zijn waarlijk allah zal de huichelaars en de ongelovigen allen in de hel verzamelen

5592419 ya soebahaana llaah alle glorie aan allah waarom heb je me niet wakker gemaakt toen je voor het eerst werd geraakt
5592420 ik was in het midden van het reciteren van de qor aan die mijn ziel vulde met ontzag en ik wilde niet mijn recitatie onderbreken
5592421 de profeet allahs vrede en zegen zij met hem had mij bevolen deze soera uit mijn hoofd te leren en de dood heb ik liever dan dat ik deze soera zou moeten onderbreken
5592422 er zijn drie mensen tussen de ansar bewooners van al madinah waar niemand aan kan tippen wat betreft deugden sad ibn moeaadh oesayd ibn khoedayr en abbaad ibn bishr
5592423 o ansar onderscheid jezelf tussen de mannen en laat de islam niet zakken
5592424 wij hebben ook ibrahim ge nspireerd en isma l en isaac en yacoeb en de stammen isa ayyoeb joenah haroen en soeleiman en aan dawoed gaven wij de psalmen
5592425 en gedenk onze slaaf ayyoeb toen hij zijn heer aanriep zeggende
5592426 stamp met je voet op de grond dit is een waterbron om in te wassen af te koelen en voor een dronk
5592427 er zijn vele isra litische tradities die vertellen dat de mensen van hem walgden vanwege zijn ziekte en dat ze niet naar zijn huis wilde komen zij verjoegen hem zelfs uit de stad alleen zijn goede vrouw liet hem niet in de steek zij bleef hem helpen gedurende deze tijd van beproeving dit zijn allemaal valse weergaves die niet geloofd moeten worden er is geen bewijs dat ze geloofwaardig zijn bovendien wordt uiteengezet dat profeten vrij moeten zijn van ziekten die de mensen walgelijk vinden als een profeet dit overkomt kan hij niet de mensen ontmoeten en hen over de wetten en regels die allah geopenbaard heeft onderrichten
5592428 de mensen die het meest beproefd worden zijn de profeten daarna de rechtschapen mensen en de meest volmaakte mensen
5592429 toen deze periode zeer lang duurde zei zijn vrouw tegen hem
5592430 ik heb zeventig jaar geleefd en ben altijd gezond geweest is het teveel om nog eens zeventig jaar geduldig te leven
5592431 waarlijk de ellende heeft mij gegrepen en u bent de barmhartigste van allen die genade tonen
5592432 dus beantwoordden wij zijn roep en wij verwijderden de ellende van hem en wij brachten zijn familie bij hem terug en nog eens zovelen
5592433 en gedenk onze slaaf ayyoeb toen zijn heer aanriep zeggende
5592434 stamp met je voet op de grond dit is een waterbron om in te wassen af te koelen en voor een dronk
5592435 en neem een bundel dun gras in jouw hand en sla daarmee je vrouw en verbreek je eed niet waarlijk wij hebben hem geduldig bevonden wat een uitmuntende slaaf waarlijk hij keerde zich altijd in berouw tot ons
5592436 op de dag van de opstanding zal allah soeleiman as als een voorbeeld aangeven voor de rijken yoesoef as als voorbeeld voor de slaven en ayyoeb as als voorbeeld voor de gekwelden
5592437 drie personen uit de stam van qoeraysh waren de meest beleefde als ze je toespraken stelden ze je nooit teleur en als jij ze sprak zouden ze je nooit verloochenen dat waren aboe bakr as siddiq oethmaan ibn affaan en aboe oebaydah ibn al djarrah
5592438 kom vanavond terug naar mij en ik zal u iemand meesturen die sterk en vertrouwenswaardig is
5592439 ik ging vroeg naar het doehr gebed hopend dat de profeet mij zou kiezen als de man met de eigenschappen die hij noemde
5592440 ga met ze en spreek rechtvaardigheid tussen hen over de waarheid waarin ze twisten
5592441 aboe oebaydah is de beste man in het breken van snijtanden
5592442 strek je arm vooruit en ik zal je trouwheid bezweren opdat ik de profeet heb horen zeggen
5592443 om mezelf naar voren te brengen in de aanwezigheid van een man die de profeet als imam voorbidder heeft gekozen en die ons leidde tot de dood van de profeet vrede en zegen zij met hem
5592444 ik heb je dringend nodig als mijn brief jou s nachts bereikt dan verzoek ik je voor dageraad te vertrekken en als mijn brief jou s middags bereikt dan verzoek ik je voor de avond te vertrekken en haast je naar me
5592445 ik weet waarom amir al moeminien mij nodig heeft hij wil het leven sparen van iemand als ik die hoe dan ook sterfelijk is
5592446 ik weet dat jij mij nodig hebt maar ik ben in een leger van moslims en ik heb geen verlangen om mezelf te redden van hetgeen dat hun getroffen heeft ik wil me niet van ze afscheiden totdat allah dat wil dus wanneer deze brief jou bereikt verlos mij dan van jouw bevel en sta mij toe om te blijven
5592447 laat me jullie wat adviezen geven die de oorzaak zullen zijn voor jullie om op het rechte pad voor eeuwig te blijven
5592448 o jullie gelovigen gehoorzaamt allah en gehoorzaamt de boodschapper en degenen onder jullie die met gezag bekleed zijn als jullie over iets van mening verschillen leg het voor aan allah en de boodschapper indien jullie in allah en de laatste dag geloven
5592449 en wat de boodschapper u ook moge geven neemt het en wat hij u ook verbiedt onthoudt u daarvan en vreest allah zeker allah is streng in het straffen
5592450 de vier geleerden die de moslims als voorbeeld moeten nemen zijn
5592451 de mensen staan op het punt om met kamelen op reis te gaan voor het vergaren van kennis ze zullen niemand vinden die meer kennis bezit dan de geleerde van medina
5592452 it is not a few scientists pocketing money and getting rich its a state policy
5592453 why hasnt a q khan been taken out by israel or the united states
5592454 we had every opportunity to put a stop to the a
5592455 husain haqqani the ppp and dynastic politics covering up the corruption of the the bhuttos and zardaris
5592456 ppp means government of the bhuttos for the bhuttos by the bhuttos
5592457 i am up for sale husain haqqani an agent of the anti islam anti pakistan forces
5592458 hij ging door de moeilijkste beproeving in het gevecht maar kwam daar ongedeerd uit
5592459 er is geen grotere zonde dan het nemen van een afgod naast allah
5592460 als er maar iets goeds aan dit beeldje was zou het op zijn minst zich verdedigen tegen zon vernedering
5592461 ik zeg niet dat allah swt de handel heeft verboden maar ik wil vooral zijn tussen degenen waar allah geprezen en verheven is hij in de qor aan over zei mensen die noch door handel noch door zaken achteloos worden om allah te gedenken het gebed te houden en de zakaat te betalen zij vrezen de dag waarop harten en ogen zich zullen afwenden
5592462 als jij tevreden bent dat ik naar syri ga en hun het boek van hun schepper onderwijs en de soennah van hun profeet en met ze bid dan zal ik gaan
5592463 o mensen van damascus jullie zijn mijn broeders in het geloof buren die zij aan zij leven en elkaar helpend tegen de vijanden o mensen van damascus wat is het dat jullie tegen houdt van openhartigheid jegens mij als ik jullie een advies geef waar ik niets van jullie voor terug wil is het goed dat ik de kennisdragers zie vertrekken overlijden terwijl de onwetenden onder jullie geen kennis zoeken ik zie dat jullie neigen naar zaken waar allah jullie over zal ondervragen en dat jullie hebben verlaten wat hij jullie heeft bevolen is het redelijk dat ik jullie zie verzamelen wat jullie niet eten en gebouwen bouwen waarin jullie niet wonen en hoop vestigen in wat jullie niet kunnen behouden mensen v r jullie hebben welvaart vergaard maakten plannen en hadden hoge wensen maar het duurde niet lang voor dat alles wat ze hebben vergaard vernietigd werd hun hoop vergaan en hun huizen veranderden in graven zo was het lot van de mensen van aad o mensen van damascus zij vulden de aarde met bezittingen en kinderen wie van jullie zou nu de hele legende van het volk van aad voor twee dirhams willen kopen
5592464 wat zouden jullie doen als deze man in een put was gevallen
5592465 beledig hem niet en sla hem niet waarschuw hem en maak hem bewust van de consequenties van zijn daad dank allah daarna dat hij jullie beschermd heeft van het vallen in dezelfde daad
5592466 neen ik haat alleen zijn wandaad en als hij afziet van deze daad dan is hij mijn broeder
5592467 o mijn zoon gedenk allah in goede tijden en allah zal je gedenken in slechte tijden
5592468 o mijn zoon draag kennis zoek kennis wees een goed luisteraar en wees geen onwetende want dat is de oorzaak van verderf
5592469 o mijn zoon laat de moskee je huis zijn voorwaar ik de profeet moge allah tevreden met hem zijn heb horen zeggen
5592470 mijn zonen het klooster van de moslim is zijn huis waar hij controle heeft over zichzelf en zijn blik kan afhouden wees gewaarschuwd over het zitten in marktplaatsen want het vreet je tijd weg in arrogantie en ijdelheid
5592471 ik heb alleen maar gedaan wat ik dacht goed te zijn voor mijn dochter
5592472 wat zouden jullie denken van mijn dochter als er bedienden om haar heen waren en zij zich bevond in een prachtige paleis waarvan de ogen duizelden wat zal er van haar geloof worden
5592473 o omar kun jij je nog de hadith van onze profeet herinneren
5592474 o allah geef hem kennis en wijsheid van de islam en laat hem zich verdiepen in de mening en interpretaties van geloofskwesties abdoellah vertelt een keer wilde de profeet woedoe rituele wassing verrichten en zoals gewoonlijk haastte ik me om zo snel mogelijk water voor hem te halen de profeet was erg blij en bij het begin van de salat gebed wees hij naar mij dat ik naast hem moest staan bij tijdens het bidden echter bleef gedurende het gebed achter hem bidden en toen het gebed eindigde vroeg de profeet mij
5592475 ik ging naar hem toe en wachtte voor zijn deur uren lang tot de wind stof op mijn hoofd blies en toen de metgezel eindelijk kwam zei hij
5592476 ik ben degene die jou moet opzoeken omdat kennis gezocht moet worden en kennis komt niet vanzelf naar je toe
5592477 en zo zijn wij bevolen om met ahl al bayt leden van het huis des profeet om te gaan
5592478 ik heb nooit iemand gezien die sneller van begrip was en die meer kennis en wijsheid bezat dan abdoellah ibn abbaas ik zag omar zijn raad nemen over problematische zaken tijdens de aanwezigheid van veteranen van badr waaronder moehadjirien en ansar zaten abdoellah zou dan praten en omar zou geen woord tegen spreken
5592479 ik zag mensen voordringen op de wegen die leiden naar het huis van abdoellah ibn abbaas tot er helemaal geen plaats meer was binnen zijn huis of zijn plein
5592480 wanneer ik het belang van een bepaalde vers uit de qor aan realiseer en achterhaal dan wens ik dat alle mensen wisten wat ik te weten ben gekomen
5592481 wanneer ik hoor dat een islamitische vorst gelijkwaardig handelt en rechtvaardig regeert dan ben ik blij voor hem en bid ik voor hem
5592482 wanneer ik hoor dat ergens op de landen der moslims regen is gevallen vult dat zelfde regenval mijn hart met geluk en blijheid
5592483 voor het vasten op de dag van aashoeraa verwacht ik dat allah de zonden van het afgelopen jaar uitwist
5592484 de profeet sallallahoe alayhi wa sallam kwam naar medienah en zag de joden vasten op de dag van aashoeraa dus zei hij
5592485 toen de boodschapper van allah sallallahoe alayhi wa sallam de dag van aashoeraa vastte en gebood dat deze gevast werd zeiden zij
5592486 wanneer het volgende jaar komt zullen we als allah het wil de tiende dag vasten
5592487 vast de dag van aashoeraa en wees tegenstrijdig aan de joden vast n dag ervoor of n dag erna
5592488 wij en onze voorvaders hebben deze goden vele jaren aanbeden en geen kwaad is ons overkomen
5592489 in dat geval zal ik jullie aan jullie ongeluk overlaten
5592490 er is geen god dan gij heilig zijt gij ik behoorde inderdaad tot de onrechtvaardigen
5592491 we maken lootjes met al de namen van de reizigers degene wiens naam getrokken wordt zal overboord worden gegooid
5592492 er is geen god dan gij heilig zijt gij ik behoorde inderdaad tot de onrechtvaardigen
5592493 waarom zou ik bang moeten zijn allah heeft me bevolen hem in te slikken
5592494 ga naar mekka en breng mij wat je maar kan vinden aan nieuws over deze man die beweert een profeet te zijn die openbaringen krijgt vanuit de hemelen luister naar wat hij te vertellen heeft en kom terug en reciteer het aan mij
5592495 die mensen nobele eigenschappen leert en wat hij zegt is niet enkel en alleen po zie
5592496 ze noemen hem een magi r een waarzegger en dichter
5592497 mijn nieuwsgierigheid is nog niet gedoofd ik ben nog niet klaar met deze zaak wil je mijn familie behoeden zodat ik naar mekka kan gaan en deze profeet en zijn missie zelf kan onderzoeken
5592498 ja maar wees op je hoede van de mensen van mekka
5592499 ga je me niet vertellen waarom je in mekka bent
5592500 alleen als je me beloofd mij te leiden naar wat ik zoek
5592501 ik kwam naar mekka van een verre plaats om een ontmoeting te regelen met de nieuwe profeet en om te luisteren naar wat hij te vertellen heeft
5592502 s morgens vroeg zal ik je naar hem brengen maar we moeten voorzichtig zijn
5592503 assalamoe alaika ya rasoeloellah vrede zij met u o boodschapper van allah
5592504 wa alaika salamoellahi wa rahamatoehoe wa barakatoeh en met jou allahs vrede genadigheid en zegeningen
5592505 vertel niemand in mekka over je bekering tot de islam ik vrees dat ze jou gaan vermoorden
5592506 bij hem die mijn ziel bezit ik zal mekka niet verlaten voor dat ik naar de heilige moskee ga en de waarheid ga verklaren voor iedereen in qoeraysh
5592507 o mensen van qoeraysh ik getuig dat er geen god is dan allah en dat mohammed de boodschapper van allah is
5592508 oei oei willen jullie een man van de ghifar stam doden en jullie karavaans passeren hun territorium
5592509 ik houd van de honger ik houd van de ziekte en ik houd van de dood
5592510 als ik honger heb vasten wordt mijn hart zachter aanbidding als ik ziek ben worden mijn zonden vergeven en als ik dood ga ontmoet ik allah
5592511 we hebben een huis daarginds doelend op het hiernamaals waar we onze beste bezittingen heen zenden goede daden
5592512 maar je moet wel wat bezittingen hebben zolang je in dit verblijf bent
5592513 de eigenaar van dit verblijf allah zal ons hier niet laten
5592514 o aamier heeft u echt niemand anders dan ik gevonden die het geld meer verdiende dan ik
5592515 de moskee die op basis van taqwa de godvrezendheid gebouwd is
5592516 wee ons wat hebben we nu gedaan de boodschapper van allah zit beneden en wij zitten hoger dan hij mogen we wel boven de boodschapper van allah lopen komen we zo dan niet tussen hem en de wahy de openbaring als dat zo is dan zijn we gedoemd
5592517 bij allah we hebben vannacht geen oog dichtgedaan ik niet en oem ayyoeb ook niet
5592518 we geven de voorkeur aan de benedenverdieping omdat veel mensen ons komen bezoeken
5592519 tot op een koude nacht een va onze kommen brak waardoor er water op de vloer kwam
5592520 aboe bakr wat brengt jou hier op dit uur van de dag
5592521 wat brengt jullie twee op dit uur van de dag hier
5592522 bij hem in wiens handen mijn ziel is honger is bij mij ook de reden waarom ik naar buiten kwam maar ga maar met mij mee
5592523 de profeet en iedereen die bij hem is is welkom
5592524 de profeet en iedereen die bij hem is is welkom
5592525 o profeet van allah dit is niet de tijd dat u gewoonlijk hier komt
5592526 o rasoeloellah eet alstublieft van de rijpe roetb als halfrijpe dadels boesr ik zal ook een beest voor je slachten
5592527 als je dat gaat doen dood dan geen beest dat melk geeft
5592528 aboe ayyoeb breng dit stuk naar fatimah ze heeft dagen lang niet zoiets gehad
5592529 dit is een overvloedige zegening waarover je op de dag des oordeels zal worden ondervraagd
5592530 al hamdoe lillah alladhie hoewa ashba na wa an ama alayna lof zij allah die ons genoeg gegeven heeft en die ons met overvloed overladen heeft dit is het beste
5592531 hij is nooit bij een slag die de moslim in de tijd van de profeet tot de tijd van moe awiyah vochten weggebleven behalve als hij opdat moment verwikkeld was in een andere slag
5592532 de profeet saaws was gewend ons te leren allahs raad te vragen in alle zaken
5592533 als iemand van jullie een belangrijke beslissing moet nemen laat hem twee rakaat bidden buiten het verplichte gebed en dan zeggen vertaling
5592534 en raadpleeg hen bij de zaak en wanneer je dan besloten hebt vertrouw dan op allah
5592535 als iemand van jullie een belangrijke beslissing moet nemen laat hem
5592536 ik getuig dat moesaylamah een oplichter is en dat mohammed de ware is maar de oplichter uit rabiah moesaylamah is ons dierbaarder dan de man van de waarheid uit moedar mohammed
5592537 mannen bijt op je kiezen sla meedogenloos toe op de vijand en druk door bij allah ik zal niet meer met jullie spreken tot moesaylamah verslagen is of ik allah heb ontmoet
5592538 als jullie erin slagen mij in te halen wat een slechte drager van koran zal ik dan zijn
5592539 o ansaar laat niemand maar dan ook niemand van jullie aan terugkeer naar medina denken medina bestaat niet meer voor jullie er is alleen nog maar allah en het paradijs
5592540 zet mij op een schild hijs het schild op pijlen en slinger mij over de muren de tuin binnen naast de poort ik zal dan sterven als een martelaar of de poort voor jullie openen
5592541 en degene die taqwa vrees voor allah heeft en zijn plicht aan hem nakomt hij zal een weg voor hem maken om eruit te komen uit elke moeilijkheid
5592542 en degene die zijn vertrouwen plaatst in allah dan zal hij voldoende voor hem zijn
5592543 alles is qadar allah de voorbestemming van allah ik vertrouw op allah en dat is voldoende voor mij
5592544 ik loop er gewoon in en ik vertrouw op allah en als mij iets gebeurd dan is dat de qadar voorbestemming van allah
5592545 is het beter voor een ziek persoon om medicijnen te gebruiken of in het geval van degenen die volledig op allah soebhanahoe wa ta ala vertrouwen om ze niet te gebruiken
5592546 70 000 mensen van mijn ummah zullen de tuin betreden zonder rekenschap te hoeven afleggen noch te worden gestraft zij zijn degenen die geen talismannen maken of ze zoeken of naar voortekenen zoeken of hun lichamen behandelen door branden en volledig vertrouwen hebben in hun rabb
5592547 o boodschapper van allah treft ons enige blaam als we geen medicijnen nemen
5592548 o dienaren van allah behandel jullie ziekten want allah de meest glorierijke heeft geen ziekte gezonden zonder dat er een geneesmiddel voor is behalve voor ouderdom
5592549 slaap op mijn plaats er zal niets slechts met je gebeuren
5592550 als iemand onder zn voeten had gekeken hadden ze ons gezien
5592551 wat denk je ja abu bakr over twee personen en allah is de derde
5592552 wie is deze sjeich en waar komt hij vandaan hij iblies antwoordde
5592553 hij komt van nedjd en hij is gekomen om te horen wat jullie over deze zaak te vertellen hebben
5592554 nee dit is geen goed idee er zullen mensen komen om hem te bevrijden
5592555 nee dit is geen goed idee jullie weten dat mohammed goed kan praten hij zal elders veel mensen bekeren en ze zullen naar mekka komen om hier de macht over te nemen
5592556 we zullen van iedere plaats van iedere stam een jonge man met een zwaard nemen en gezamenlijk zullen ze hem doden zo zullen we zn bloed over de stammen verdelen zodat er niet een schuldige aan te wijzen is en ze ons niet zullen aanvallen en dan zullen we eindelijk rust hebben
5592557 slaap deze nacht niet op je plaats waar je normaal slaapt
5592558 mohammed zegt dat als jullie hem volgen jullie de koning zullen worden van de arabieren en dat jullie na jullie dood naar al jennah het paradijs zullen gaan en als jullie hem niet volgen dan zullen jullie naar an narr het vuur gaan
5592559 allah heeft jullie vernederd wallahi bij allah hij is al lang weggegaan en langs jullie gegaan en heeft zonder uitzondering ieder van jullie zand op zn hoofd geplaatst
5592560 wallahi degene die heeft verteld dat mohammed vertrokken is heeft de waarheid verteld
5592561 toen ze urwah ibn az zubair zn been wilden amputeren zeiden ze tegen hem
5592562 allah heeft me deze beproeving gegeven met de bedoeling om mijn geduld te testen moet ik me dan gedragen tegen zijn wil
5592563 een man van bani israiel het volk van israiel vroeg aan een andere man van bani israiel om hem duizend dinar te lenen
5592564 o allah u weet goed dat ik een lening heb genomen van duizend dinar van die en die hij vroeg een borg van mij maar ik vertelde hem dat allahs borg voldoende was en hij accepteerde uw borg toen vroeg hij om een getuige en ik vertelde hem dat allah voldoende was als getuige en hij accepteerde u als getuige geen twijfel ik heb hard geprobeerd om een vervoermiddel te vinden zodat ik zijn geld kon terug betalen maar kon het niet vinden aldus geef ik dit geld over aan u
5592565 bij allah ik heb hard geprobeerd om een boot te krijgen zodat ik jou je geld kon brengen maar ik faalde om er een te krijgen voor degene waarmee ik ben gekomen
5592566 ik heb je gezegd dat ik geen andere boot kon krijgen dan die waarmee ik gekomen ben
5592567 allah heeft namens jou het geld dat je in het stuk hout hebt gezonden afgeleverd dus je mag je duizend dinar houden en vertrekken als iemand die op het rechte pad geleid is
5592568 een persoon kwam naar mij toe terwijl ik sliep en hij pakte het zwaard vast
5592569 genoeg je bent op het rechte pad je hebt alles wat je nodig hebt je bent beschermd hierna gaat sjaitan plotseling weg en een andere sjaitan zegt tegen hem
5592570 allah alleen is voldoende voor ons en hij is al wakiel op hem kunnen we het beste vertrouwen en hij is beschermer voor ons
5592571 zeg tegen mohammed dat wij verzameld zijn en onderweg zijn om hem en zijn metgezellen te vernietigen
5592572 allah is voldoende voor ons en hij is al wakiel de beste beschermer
5592573 spreek mijn verklaring niet tegen want ik heb hen medegedeeld dat jij mijn zuster bent bij allah er zijn geen ware gelovigen in dit land behalve jij en ik
5592574 o allah ik heb geloofd in u en uw boodschapper en ik heb mijn geslachtsdelen voor iedereen beschermd behalve mijn echtgenoot dus alstublieft laat deze kefir ongelovige mij niet overmeesteren
5592575 o allah ik heb geloofd in u en uw boodschapper en ik heb mijn geslachtsdelen voor iedereen beschermd behalve mijn echtgenoot dus alstublieft laat deze kafir ongelovige mij niet overmeesteren
5592576 o allah als hij zal dood gaan zullen de mensen zeggen dat ik hem vermoord heb
5592577 allah heeft de kafir vernederd en gaf ons een slavin om ons de dienen
5592578 en waarom zouden we ons vertrouwen niet in allah stellen terwijl hij ons inderdaad op onze wegen heeft geleid en we zullen zeker met sabr geduld al het letsel dragen dat jullie voor ons veroorzaken en laat degenen die vertrouwen in allah alleen hun vertrouwen plaatsen
5592579 aldus is sabr geduld voor mij het meest passend en het is allah alleen wiens hulp gezocht kan worden tegen wat jullie beweren
5592580 waarlijk het besluit berust alleen bij allah in hem stel ik mijn vertrouwen en laat al diegenen die willen vertrouwen hun vertrouwen in hem stellen
5592581 geef nooit de hoop op voor allahs genade zeker niemand wanhoopt voor allahs genade behalve de mensen die ongelovig zijn
5592582 bij allah ik vergelijk mijn situatie met jou niet behalve met de situatie van yousufs vader yacoub die zei
5592583 dus voor mij is geduld het meest passende tegen datgene dat jij beweert en het is allahs hulp alleen die gezocht kan worden
5592584 het geval van een gelovige is prachtig er is goed voor hem in alles en dit kenmerk is exclusief voor hem alleen indien hij iets aangenaams ervaart is hij dankbaar aan allah en dat is goed voor hem en als hij enig tegenspoed aantreft is hij geduldig en nederig en dat is ook goed voor hem
5592585 maar degenen die geloven houden meer van allah dan al het andere
5592586 is er iemand die mij roept zodat ik zijn gebed kan beantwoorden is er iemand die van mij vraagt zodat ik zijn verzoek kan inwilligen is er iemand die mijn vergeving zoekt zodat ik hem kan vergeven
5592587 o mijn dienaren ik heb voor mijzelf onrechtvaardigheid beslist uitgesloten en heb dat ook aan jullie onder elkaar verboden behandelt elkaar dus niet onrechtvaardig o mijn dienaren jullie dwalen allemaal behalve degene die ik geleid heb vraagt mij dus om leiding en ik zal jullie leiden o mijn dienaren jullie lijden allemaal honger behalve degene die ik gevoed heb vraagt mij dus om voedsel en ik zal jullie voeden o mijn dienaren jullie zijn allemaal naakt behalve degenen die ik gekleed heb vraagt mij dus om kleding en ik zal jullie kleden o mijn dienaren jullie maken dag en nacht fouten en ik vergeef alle zonden vraagt mij dus om vergiffenis en ik zal jullie vergeven o mijn dienaren jullie zijn niet in staat on mij nadeel toe te brengen en jullie kunnen mij dus ook geen nadeel berokkenen jullie zijn niet in staat mij van nut te zijn en jullie kunnen dus ook niet nuttig voor mij zijn o mijn dienaren al zouden jullie van de eerste tot de laatste mens en djinn net zo vroom zijn als de vroomste ziel onder jullie dan zou dat niets aan mijn heerschappij toevoegen o mijn dienaren al zouden jullie van de eerste tot de laatste mens en djinn net zo laaghartig zijn als de meest laaghartige onder jullie dan zou dat niets aan mijn heerschappij afdoen o mijn dienaren al zouden jullie van de eerste tot de laatste mens en djinn allemaal op een open vlakte staan en zouden jullie je verlangen aan mij kenbaar maken dan zou mijn bezit al zou ik iedereen geven wat hij verlangde niet meer verminderen dan wat een naald aan de zee onttrekt wanneer zij daarin gedoopt wordt o mijn dienaren jullie daden zijn uitsluitend voor jullie rekening en daarnaar zullen jullie beloond worden laat daarom iemand die iets goeds ontvangt in het hiernamaals allah prijzen en laat degene die iets anders ontvangt niemand anders dan zichzelf daar een verwijt van maken
5592588 de hypocrieten vinden het verrichten van het gezamenlijke fejr en asr gebed een zware opgave als zij de waarde van deze twee gebeden wisten dan zouden zij het zeker hebben verricht zelfs als ze daarvoor moesten kruipen
5592589 en tot het volk van thamoed stuurden wij hun broeder salih
5592590 en gedenk dat hij jullie tot de opvolgers van de aad heeft gemaakt en je bewoners in het land heeft gegeven en jullie bouwden voor jezelf paleizen op de vlakten en groeven huizen uit de bergen overdenk dus de gunsten van allah en sticht geen onheil op aarde
5592591 vraag dan vergeving van hem en keer je tot hem in berouw d w z geef op waarmee je bezig bent en geef je over aan aanbidding van allah mijn heer is nabij en verhorend
5592592 o salih je was tot nu toe voor ons iemand van goede hoop
5592593 verbied je nu ons de aanbidding die onze voorvaderen ook aanbeden hebben wij verkeren echt in grote twijfel over datgene waartoe je ons hebt uitgenodigd
5592594 o mijn volk vertel mij als ik een duidelijk bewijs van mijn heer heb en er tot mij een genade van hem komt wie kan mij dan tegen allah helpen als ik ongehoorzaam ben dan laten jullie alleen mijn verlies toenemen
5592595 veronderstel dat datgene waartoe ik jullie uitnodig de waarheid is hoe kun je het bestrijden uit het oogpunt van allah hoe kun je vrede vinden als je mij vraagt om mijn oproep alleen hem te aanbidden op te geven zou ik gehoor geven aan jullie verzoek dan zou niemand van jullie en niemand van een ander volk veilig zijn voor de bestraffing van allah
5592596 als je een kamelin uit die rots kunt halen die er zus en zo uit ziet dan zullen we je uitnodiging geloven
5592597 zul je heel zeker in mij geloven als ik jullie dat breng wat jullie willen
5592598 hier is een kamelin zij heeft het recht om water te drinken en jullie hebben het recht om water te drinken ieder op een dag die bekend is raak haar niet aan om haar te kwetsen opdat jullie niet op de grote dag door de bestraffing gegrepen worden
5592599 en wees geduldig qoer aan 54 27 ten opzichte van de schade die ze jou wilden berokkenen want je zult getuige zijn van hun noodlot
5592600 hier is een kamelin zij heeft het recht om water te drinken en jullie hebben het recht om water te drinken ieder op een dag die bekend is
5592601 dus sneden zij de hielpezen van de kamelin door en schaamteloos ontkenden zij het bevel van hun heer
5592602 dus sneden zij de hielpezen van de kamelin door en schaamteloos ontkenden zij het bevel van hun heer qoer aan 7 77
5592603 dus sneden zij de hielpezen van de kamelin door en schaamteloos ontkenden zij het bevel van hun heer en zeiden
5592604 maar zij riepen hun metgezel en hij nam een zwaard en sneed haar pezen door dan hoe vreselijk waren mijn bestraffing en mijn waarschuwingen
5592605 vrees de kwade afloop wees voorzichtig dit is de kamelin van allah
5592606 en kwets haar niet anders zal een pijnlijke bestraffing jullie grijpen in een ander vers werd de straf beschreven als de straf van de grote dag in een derde vers in de soerah al araf ver 73 werd het beschreven als een afschuwelijke straf en alle zeggen de waarheid
5592607 vermaak jullie jezelf maar in jullie huizen gedurende drie dagen dit is een belofte die jullie niet kunnen verloochenen
5592608 vermaak jullie jezelf maar in jullie huizen gedurende drie dagen
5592609 zweer wederzijds bij allah dat wij een geheime nachtelijke aanval op hem en zijn huishouding zullen plegen en daarna zullen wij zeker tegen zijn naaste verwanten zeggen
5592610 alsof zij nooit geleefd hadden geen twijfel waarlijk de thamoed geloofden niet in hun heer weg dus met de thamoed
5592611 o mijn volk ik heb zeker de boodschap van mijn heer aan jullie verkondigd en heb jullie een goed advies gegeven maar jullie houden niet van goede adviseurs
5592612 o volk van qalib hebben jullie werkelijk dat verkregen wat jullie heer jullie beloofd had ikzelf heb gekregen wat mijn heer mij beloofd had wat waren jullie een slechte stam tegenover jullie profeet jullie verloochenden mij terwijl andere mensen in mij geloofden jullie dreven me weg terwijl andere mensen mij onderdak verschaften jullie vochten tegen mij terwijl andere mensen mij ondersteunden wat waren jullie een slechte stam tegenover jullie profeet
5592613 bij degene in wiens hand mijn ziel is jij hoort mijn woorden niet duidelijker dan zij maar zij kunnen niet antwoorden
5592614 abdoellah ibn oemar overgeleverd dat in het jaar van taboek toen de boodschapper van allah vzmh voorbij de vallei van hidjr kwam in het land dat door de thamoed bewoond werd hij zei
5592615 degene die gelooft in allah en de laatste dag laat hem het goede zeggen of zwijgen
5592616 als hij wenst te spreken en hetgeen hij wenst te zeggen is goed en hij is ervan overtuigd dat hij voor de woorden beloond zal worden ongeacht of dit verplicht of moestahabb aanbevolen is laat hem dan spreken als het echter niet iets goeds lijkt te zijn en hij er niet voor beloond zal worden laat hem dan zwijgen ongeacht of hij denkt dat dit haraam verboden makroeh afkeurenswaardig of toegestaan is
5592617 er is geen woord dat hij uit of aan zijn zijde bevindt zich een waker die gereed staat om het op te schrijven
5592618 het beheersen van je tong tevreden zijn met de ruimte van je woning en huilen over jouw zonden
5592619 zal ik jou vertellen wat het fundament is van al dat
5592620 o boodschapper van allah zullen wij verantwoordelijk gehouden worden voor hetgeen dat wij ermee zeggen
5592621 moge jij van je moeder ontnomen worden o moeaadz zullen de mensen in de hel gegooid worden op hun gezichten of op hun neuzen voor iets anders dan de oogst van hun tongen
5592622 wanneer mijn metgezellen genoemd worden blijf dan stil als de sterren genoemd worden blijf dan stil en als het goddelijk besluit genoemd wordt blijf dan stil
5592623 en de allereerste moslims van de uitgewekenen moehaadjiroen 6 en de ansaar 7 en degenen die hen volgden in goede daden allah heeft welbehagen genoegen aan hen en zij hebben welbehagen aan hem hij heeft voor hen tuinen in het paradijs waaronder door rivieren stromen zij zijn daarin eeuwig levenden dat is de geweldige overwinning
5592624 moehammad is de boodschapper van allah en degenen die met hem zijn zijn streng tegenover de ongelovigen maar onderling barmhartig jij ziet hen zich neerbuigen en zich neerknielen zij zoeken een gunst van allah en zijn welgevallen hun kenmerken zijn zichtbaar in hun gezichten door de sporen van neerknielingen
5592625 e n van de basisprincipes van ahloe s soennah wa 10 is dat zij niets zeggen of denken om de metgezellen van de boodschapper van allah te bekritiseren zoals allah hen heeft beschreven in het vers waarin hij zegt
5592626 onze heer vergeef ons en onze broeders die ons zijn voorafgegaan in het geloof en maak in onze harten geen wrok jegens degenen die geloven onze heer voorwaar u bent zachtmoedig meest barmhartig
5592627 vervloek mijn metgezellen niet want bij degene in wiens hand mijn ziel ligt als n van jullie het gelijke van de berg oehoed aan goederen geeft in liefdadigheid dan nog zou hij de status van n van hen niet bereiken noch zal hij halverwege komen
5592628 als je een man ziet die n van de sahaabah 13 bekritiseert weet dan dat hij een ketter is omdat de qor aan waarheid is en de boodschapper waarheid is hetgeen hij gebracht heeft waarheid is en niemand heeft dat alles aan ons bekend gemaakt behalve de sahaabah degene die hen dus bekritiseert zegt dus dat de qor aan en soennah 14 vals zijn het is daarom meer gepast dat hij bekritiseerd wordt en veroordeeld wordt als een ketter die misleid is
5592629 het goddelijk besluit is een geheim dat allah verborgen heeft gehouden voor
5592630 hij kan niet over zijn handelingen ondervraagd worden terwijl zij wel ondervraagd worden
5592631 18 degene die dus vraagtekens plaatst bij wat allah doet heeft het oordeel uitspraak van het boek verworpen en degene die het oordeel de uitspraak van het boek verwerpt is een ongelovige kaafir
5592632 allah stelt een engel aan in de baarmoeder die zegt
5592633 o heer mannelijk of vrouwelijk verdoemd of gezegend wat is zijn voorziening wat is zijn levensduur
5592634 er is geen mens aan wie geen engel is toegewezen om hem te beschermen wanneer hij slaapt en wanneer hij wakker is tegen de djinn tegen mensen en tegen wilde beesten alles wat zijn richting op komt sturen deze engelen weg behalve waarvoor allah taaala toestemming geeft om te gebeuren
5592635 een groep van de stam van muraad wilde jou doden
5592636 iedere mens heeft twee engelen om hem te beschermen tegen alles wat niet voor hem voorbeschikt is als de beschikking komt trekken zij zich terug en ze staan niet tussen hem en wat voor hem beschikt is de levensduur die voor hem beschikt is vormt de bescherming voor de mens
5592637 wanneer een moslim een slechte daad begaat schrijft de engel aan de linkerzijde niets op voordat zes uren verstreken zijn als hij berouw krijgt en allah om vergeving vraagt verwerpt hij het schrijft hij niets neer anders schrijft hij n sayi ah slechte daad neer
5592638 de aayah en voor de mens zijn er bewakers engelen voor hem en achter hem zij waken over hem op bevel van allah ar ra d 13 11 betekent iedereen heeft engelen bij zich die hem om beurten bewaken s nachts en overdag die hem beschermen tegen slechte zaken en tegen ongelukken net zoals andere engelen om beurten zijn goede en slechte daden noteren s nachts en overdag er zijn dus overdag vier engelen en s nachts vier andere
5592639 o malik laat jouw heer een eind aan ons maken
5592640 ik leed door de handen van jouw volk en het ergste dat ik leed was wat ik door hun toedoen leed op de dag van aqabah dat was toen ik ibn abd yaalayl ibn abd al kalaa tot de islaam uitnodigde en hij weigerde ik ging weg en voelde me teneergeslagen en wist nauwelijks waar ik heen ging ik kwam pas weer tot mijn positieven toen ik qarn al tha aalib bereikte ik hief mijn hoofd op en zag dat ik in de schaduw van een wolk was ik keek en zag djibriel aleihi sallam in de wolk hij riep me en zei allah heeft gehoord wat jouw volk zei en hoe ze op jou reageerden hij heeft de engel van de bergen gestuurd zodat je hem kan zeggen te doen wat je wilt dat hij doet
5592641 o muhammed zeg me wat ik moet doen als je wilt kan ik ze verpletteren tussen twee bergen
5592642 salamoen aleikoem vrede zij met jullie treedt het paradijs binnen wegens wat jullie plachten te doen an nahl 16 32
5592643 voorwaar ik ben met jullie versterkt daarom degenen die geloven ik zal angst werpen in de harten van degenen die ongelovig zijn
5592644 allah ta ala heeft engelen die rondreizen op zoek naar de mensen van dhikr
5592645 ze verheerlijken prijzen loven u en geven uitdrukking aan hun respect voor u
5592646 ze zouden nog fanatieker worden en toegewijd in hun lofprijzingen en aanbidding
5592647 nee bij allah o heer ze hebben het niet gezien
5592648 en hoe zou het zijn als ze het gezien hadden
5592649 ze zouden er nog meer naar verlangen en ze zouden u er nog meer om vragen
5592650 en hoe zou het zijn als ze het zouden zien
5592651 ze zouden nog meer vrees hebben en proberen eraan te ontkomen
5592652 die en die die bij hen zit hoort niet echt bij hen hij kwam naar hun bijeenkomst om de n of andere reden
5592653 ze waren allemaal aanwezig in de bijeenkomst en niet n van hen zal worden uitgesloten van de vergeving
5592654 de engelen betreden geen huis waar zich een hond of een beeld bevindt
5592655 ik zoek mijn toevlucht bij de heer der mensen 3 de koning der mensen 4 de god der mensen 5 opdat hij mij bevrijde van het kwade der inblazingen van de duivel 6 die in het hart der mensen fluistert 7 vanuit het midden der djinn en mensen
5592656 ik zoek mijn toevlucht bij de heer van de dageraad 3 tegen het kwade van wat hij heeft geschapen 4 en tegen het kwade van de duisternis wanneer deze zich verspreidt 5 en tegen het kwade van degenen die vaste banden door boze inblazingen willen ontbinden 6 en van het kwade van de benijder wanneer deze benijdt
5592657 allah is de enige 3 allah is zichzelf genoeg eeuwig 4 hij verwekte niet noch werd hij verwekt 5 en niemand is hem in enig opzicht gelijk
5592658 allah zegt ik heb voor mijn dienaren klaargemaakt wat geen oog ooit heeft gezien en wat geen oor ooit heeft gehoord en waarvan de mens nooit heeft durven dromen lees maar de volgende woorden van allah interpretatie van de betekenis
5592659 en geen ziel weet wat voor haar verborgen ligt aan bekoringen voor het oog
5592660 hoe kan iemand de waarde van een huis vaststellen dat allah met zijn hand heeft aangeplant en dit als verblijfplaats heeft aangewezen voor zijn geliefden en dit heeft opgevuld met zijn genade giften en welbehagen
5592661 o bewoners van het paradijs jullie heer de prijzenswaardige de verhevene vraagt jullie om hem te bezoeken komt geef gehoor aan zijn uitnodiging hem op te zoeken
5592662 o allah u bent as salaam en van u is salaam afkomstig geprezen zij u o bezitter van grootsheid en glorie
5592663 waar zijn mijn dienaren die mij hebben gehoorzaamd zonder mij te hebben gezien dit is de dag van vermeerdering
5592664 o bewoners van het paradijs als ik niet met jullie tevreden zou zijn dan had ik jullie niet mijn paradijs laten bewonen dit is de dag van vermeerdering vraagt mij dan ook
5592665 laat ons uw aangezicht zien zodat wij ernaar kunnen kijken
5592666 o die en die herinner jij je nog de dag waarop je jezelf schuldig hebt gemaakt aan dit en dat
5592667 welzeker was het niet voor mijn vergeving dan had je dit nooit kunnen bereiken
5592668 gezichten zullen op die dag verlicht zijn naar hun heer zullen zij kijken en gezichten zullen op die dag donker zijn
5592669 de boodschapper van allah sallallahoe aleihi wa sallam zag djibriel in zijn ware gedaante hij had zeshonderd vleugels en elke vleugel bedekte de hele horizon van zijn vleugels vielen juwelen parels en robijnen en alleen allah weet over hen
5592670 ik zag djibriel uit de hemel neerdalen en de omvang van zijn gedaante vulde de ruimte tussen hemel en aarde
5592671 ik heb toestemming gekregen om te spreken over n van de engelen van allah die de troon dragen de afstand tussen zijn oorlellen en zijn schouders is gelijk aan de afstand van zevenhonderd jaar lang reizen
5592672 djibriel aleihi sallam kwam bij de profeet sallallahoe aleihi wa sallam en vroeg hem
5592673 zo is het ook met de engelen die aanwezig waren bij badr
5592674 zeker allah heeft het vasten van de zwangere en zogende vrouw terzijde gelegd
5592675 de eerste onder de mensen tegen wie het oordeel wordt uitgesproken op de dag der opstanding zal een man zijn die als martelaar gestorven is
5592676 ik hoorde de boodschapper van allah moge hij de zegeningen en vrede van allah krijgen zeggen
5592677 reciteer het voor jezelf want ik heb de profeet moge hij de zegeningen en vrede van allah krijgen horen zeggen
5592678 dit is tussen mij en mijn dienaar en mijn dienaar krijgt wat hij vraagt
5592679 ihdina s siraata l moestaqiem sirata lladziena an3amta 3alaihim ghairi l maghdubi 3alaihim wa la d daallien
5592680 dit is voor mijn dienaar en mijn dienaar zal krijgen wat hij vraagt
5592681 de eerste daad 32 waarvoor de dienaar van allah op de dag der opstanding verantwoording moet afleggen is het gebed
5592682 kijk of mijn dienaar nog vrijwillige gebeden heeft gedaan die het ontbrekende in zijn verplichte gebeden kunnen aanvullen daarna wordt de rest van zijn daden op dezelfde manier beoordeeld
5592683 het vasten is voor mij en ik geef er een beloning voor een man geeft zijn seksuele genot zijn eten en drinken voor mij op vasten is als een schild en degene die vast heeft twee genoegens een genoegen als hij zijn vasten verbreekt en een genoegen als hij zijn heer ontmoet de verandering van adem 35 uit de mond van een vastende is volgens allahs maatstaf beter dan de geur van muskus
5592684 besteed 36 o zoon van adam en ik zal aan jou besteden
5592685 o heer onder hen is die en die een heel zondige dienaar die slechts voorbij kwam en bij hen is gaan zitten
5592686 abbas moge allah tevreden met hem zijn van de boodschapper van allah moge hij de zegeningen en vrede van allah krijgen dat er onder zijn uitspraken die hij van zijn heer de verheerlijkte en de verhevene gehoord had n is waarin hij gezegt heeft
5592687 allah heeft de goede en de slechte daden opgeschreven dan legde hij het uit door te zeggen dat degene die zich voorgenomen heeft om een goede daad te doen en dit niet doet hij het voor zichzelf als n goede daad opschrijft maar als hij zich voorgenomen heeft om het te doen en hij doet het ook dan schrijft hij het voor zichzelf op vari rend van tien goede daden tot zevenhonderd goede daden of nog vele malen meer maar als hij zich voorgenomen heeft om een slechte daad te doen en hij doet het niet dan schrijft hij het op als n goede daad maar als hij het voorneemt en hij doet het ook dan schrijft hij het op als n slechte daad
5592688 o mijn dienaren ik heb mijzelf verboden te onderdrukken en ik heb het jullie verboden ondruk elkander niet o mijn dienaren jullie dwalen allen behalve diegene die ik geleid heb zoek daarom mijn leiding en ik zal jullie leiden o mijn dienaren jullie hebben allen honger behalve degene die ik gevoed heb zoek daarom mijn voedsel en ik zal jullie voeden o mijn dienaren jullie zijn allen naakt behalve degene die ik gekleed heb zoek daarom mijn kleding en ik zal jullie kleden o mijn dienaren jullie zondigen bij nacht en bij dag en ik vergeef alle zonden zoek daarom mijn vergiffenis en ik zal jullie vergeven o mijn dienaren jullie kunnen mij niet kwetsen want ik ben onkwetsbaar en jullie kunnen mijn gunsten niet van me afnemen en jullie kunnen mij niet begunstigen o mijn dienaren als de eerste van jullie en de laatste van jullie de mensen van jullie en de djinns van jullie zo vroom waren als het vroomste hart van welke man van jullie dan ook dan zou dit mijn koninkrijk met niets vermeerderen o mijn dienaren als de eerste van jullie en de laatste van jullie de mensen van jullie en de djinns van jullie zo verdorven waren als het meest verdorven hart van welke man van jullie dan ook het zal mijn koninkrijk met niets verminderen o mijn dienaren als de eerste van jullie en de laatste van jullie de mensen van jullie en de djinns van jullie met elkaar zouden opstaan en mij een verzoek zouden doen en ik iedereen zou geven waar hij om vroeg dan zou dit niet verminderen wat ik heb niet meer dan een naald de zee verminderd als hij daar in wordt in gestoken 49 o mijn dienaren het zijn uw daden waarvoor ik jullie verantwoordelijk stel en jullie vergoed laat daarom degene die het goede 50 vindt allah prijzen en laat degene die iets anders vindt niemand anders dan zichzelf verwijten
5592689 allah de almachtige en de verhevene zal op de dag der opstanding zeggen
5592690 o zoon van adam ik voelde mij ziek en jij hebt mij niet bezocht
5592691 o heer en hoe had ik u moeten bezoeken terwijl u de heer der werelden bent
5592692 wist je niet dat mijn dienaar die en die jou om voedsel had gevraagd en je gaf hem niet te eten wist je niet dat als je hem gevoed had je dat zeker bij mij gevonden had 51 o zoon van adam ik vroeg je om mij te drinken te geven en je hebt mij niet te drinken gegeven
5592693 o heer hoe had ik u te drinken moeten geven want u bent de heer der werelden
5592694 mijn dienaar die en die heeft je om drinken gevraagd en je hebt hem niet te drinken gegeven als je hem te drinken had gegeven dan had je dat zeker bij mij gevonden
5592695 trots is mijn mantel en grootsheid mijn kleed en degene die met mij om n van beiden wedijvert die zal ik in het hellevuur werpen
5592696 de poorten van het paradijs zullen op maandag en donderdag geopend zijn en iedere dienaar van allah die geen deelgenoten aan allah heeft toegekend zal vergeven worden behalve de man die een wrok tegen zijn broeder heeft
5592697 er zijn drie 54 wiens tegenstander ik op de dag der opstanding zal zijn een man die in mijn naam zijn woord heeft gegeven en dat gebroken heeft een man die een vrije man als slaaf 55 verkocht heeft en de prijs daarvan geconsumeerd heeft en een man die een arbeider gehuurd heeft diens volledige inspanning heeft ontvangen en hem niet zijn loon heeft gegeven
5592698 hij stuit op een zaak die allah aangaat waar hij iets over had moeten zeggen maar hij zegt het niet daarom zegt allah de almachtige de verhevene op de dag der opstanding tot hem
5592699 waar zijn degenen die elkaar liefhebben dankzij mijn glorie vandaag zal ik hen schaduw in mijn schaduw geven het zal een dag zijn waar geen schaduw dan mijn schaduw is
5592700 als allah een dienaar van hem liefheeft roept hij djibriel vrede zij met hem en zegt
5592701 allah houdt van die en die hou daarom van hem
5592702 ik heb een hekel aan die en die heb daarom een hekel aan hem
5592703 allah heeft een hekel aan die en die heb daarom een hekel aan hem
5592704 ze hebben daarom een hekel aan hem en voor hem wordt er op aarde vijandschap ingesteld
5592705 wie zich vijandig toont jegens iemand die aan mij is toegewijd daar zal ik mee in oorlog zijn mijn dienaar komt nader tot mij met iets waar ik meer van houd dan de religieuze verplichtingen die ik hem heb opgelegd en mijn dienaar komt steeds dichterbij door extra vrijwillige goede daden waardoor ik meer van hem ga houden als ik van hem houd dan ben ik zijn gehoor waarmee hij hoort en ben zijn gezicht waarmee hij ziet zijn hand waarmee hij aanraakt en zijn voet waarmee hij loopt als hij iets van mij vraagt dan geef ik het hem beslist en als hij bij mij toevlucht zoekt dan sta ik het hem beslist toe ik aarzel over niets meer dan over het opeisen van de ziel van mijn toegewijde dienaar hij haat de dood en ik haat het om hem te kwetsen
5592706 waarlijk van degenen die zich aan mij hebben gewijd heb ik het liefst de gelovige met karige middelen die zich veel aan het gebed heeft overgegeven die goed was in de aanbidding tot zijn heer en hem in stilte heeft gehoorzaamd 61 die zich voor de mensen verborg en niet met de vingers werd nagewezen en die net genoeg verdiende om van te leven en dit in geduld verdroeg
5592707 de dood zal vroeg bij hem komen hij zal maar weinig mensen hebben die om hem rouwen zijn bezit zal schamel zijn
5592708 we vroegen of ik vroeg 63 abdoellah dat wil zeggen ibn masoed over dit vers
5592709 wat zouden wij nog wensen nu wij vrij door het paradijs kunnen vliegen
5592710 o heer wij zouden graag willen dat u onze zielen weer in onze lichamen terugbrengt zodat we nog een keer voor u kunnen vechten
5592711 onder degenen die voor jullie kwamen was een man met een wond
5592712 de beloning voor mijn toegewijde dienaar als ik zijn beste vriend van de bewoners van de wereld tot mij heb genomen en hij dit geduldig voor mij verdraagt zal niets minder dan het paradijs zijn
5592713 als mijn dienaar mij wil ontmoeten dan wil ik hem ontmoeten als hij mij niet wil ontmoeten wil ik hem niet ontmoeten
5592714 hij die allah wil ontmoeten allah wil hem ontmoeten en hij die allah niet wil ontmoeten allah wil hem niet ontmoeten
5592715 o profeet van allah komt dit door de afkeer van de dood want iedereen heeft toch een afkeer van de dood
5592716 dat is niet zo maar het is zo dat als een gelovige het nieuws van allahs genade zijn instemming en zijn paradijs hoort dan wil hij allah ontmoeten en allah wil hem ontmoeten maar als de ongelovige het nieuws van allahs straf en zijn onvrede hoort dan wil hij allah niet ontmoeten en allah wil hem niet ontmoeten
5592717 in de overlevering van muslim wordt de hadith niet toegeschreven aan allah de hadith in deze strekking wordt ook vertaald in tirmidhi en al nasai
5592718 wie is dat die bij mij zweert dat ik die en dieniet zal vergeven waarlijk ik heb die en dievergeven en ik heb jouw eigen goede daden teniet gedaan 68 of van soortgelijke strekking 69
5592719 een man had grote zonden tegen zichzelf begaan en toen de dood naderde beval hij zijn zoons
5592720 breng voort wat je hebt genomen en daar was hij
5592721 wat heeft jou ingegeven om te doen wat je deed
5592722 mijn dienaar heeft een zonde begaan en weet dat hij een heer heeft die de zonde vergeeft en ze bestraft
5592723 mijn dienaar heeft een zonde begaan en weet dat hij een heer heeft die de zonde vergeeft en ze bestraft
5592724 mijn dienaar heeft een zonde begaan en weet dat hij een heer heeft die de zonde vergeeft en ze bestraft doe wat je wilt want ik heb je vergeven
5592725 o zoon van adam zo lang je een beroep op mij doet en mij vraagt zal ik je vergeven voor wat je gedaan hebt en ik vind dat niet erg o zoon van adam al reikten je zonden tot de wolken van de hemel als je mij om vergeving vroeg zou ik je vergeven o zoon van adam als je tot mij kwam met zonden die bijna zo groot als de aarde waren en als je mij onder ogen zou komen zonder mij deelgenoten toe te schrijven dan zou ik je vergiffenis geven bijna zo groot als dat
5592726 onze heer de verheerlijkte en verhevene daalt iedere nacht af tot de hemel van de aarde als het laatste derde deel van de nacht aanbreekt en hij zegt
5592727 de gelovigen zullen op de dag der opstanding bij elkaar komen en zeggen
5592728 ik ben niet in de positie om dat te doen
5592729 ik ben niet in de positie om dat te doen
5592730 ga naar jezus allahs dienaar en boodschapper allahs woord en geest
5592731 ik ben niet in de positie om dat te doen
5592732 zo zullen ze bij mij komen en ik zal naar voren treden en om toestemming vragen om bij mijn heer te komen en de toestemming zal mij gegeven worden en als ik dan mijn heer zie dan zal ik knielen
5592733 ik heb voor mijn rechtgeschapen dienaren voorbereid wat geen oog ooit gezien en geen oor ooit gehoord heeft noch is het in het menselijk hart verschenen
5592734 en geen enkele ziel weet welke vreugde er voor hem verborgen blijft
5592735 toen allah het paradijs en het hellevuur geschapen had stuurde hij djibriel naar het paradijs en zei
5592736 hij kwam er dus naar toe en keek ernaar en naar wat allah voor de bewoners had voorbereid
5592737 keer er naar terug en kijk naar wat ik er voor de bewoners in voorbereid heb
5592738 bij al uw glorie ik ben bang dat er niemand naar binnen zal gaan
5592739 ga naar het hellevuur en kijk ernaar en naar wat ik voor zijn bewoners erin heb voorbereid
5592740 bij uw glorie niemand die hierover hoort zal er binnen willen treden
5592741 bij uw glorie ik ben bang dat niemand aan de binnenkomst erin zal ontsnappen
5592742 het paradijs en het hellevuur waren samen aan het redetwisten het hellevuur zei
5592743 o onze heer wij presenteren onszelf aan u en zijn er tot uw genoegen en goedheid is in uw handen
5592744 ik zal ervoor zorgen dat mijn gunsten op jullie neerdalen en zal daarna nooit meer ontevreden over jullie zijn
5592745 diegenen die de maand ramadan vasten met oprecht geloof imaan en hopen op een beloning van allah al hun voorgaande zonden zullen vergeven worden en diegenen die in salaat stonden in de lailat ul qadr met oprecht geloof en hopen op een beloning van allah al hun voorgaande zonden zullen vergeven worden
5592746 o allah u bent degene die vergeving schenkt voor zonden u schenkt graag vergeving o allah vergeef mij
5592747 en zij kunnen niets van zijn kennis omvatten dan wat hij wil
5592748 niets behalve de dood kan diegene weerhouden van het paradijs die na iedere fard gebed ayatul koersie reciteert
5592749 als de dood er niet was zou een ieder die ayatul koersie reciteert na iedere fard gebed rechtstreeks naar het paradijs gaan
5592750 wa la ja oedoehoe hief dhoehoema wa hoewa al 3aliyoe al 3adiem
5592751 en ik heb de djinn en de mensen slechts tot mijn aanbidding geschapen
5592752 o mozes als de aarde de hemelen en de inhoud ervan de zee n en wat erin zit op de ene kant van een weegschaal gelegd zouden worden en op de andere schaal de kamila tawhied zwaarder wegen
5592753 het past een gelovige man en een gelovige vrouw niet wanneer allah en zijn profeet iets beslist hebben nog de vrije keus hebben in hun beschikking en wie allah en zijn gezant trotseert dwaalt duidelijk
5592754 de profeet vzmh zei heb allah lief omwille van het goede dat hij jullie elke dag schenkt en heb mij lief omwille van de liefde die hij voor mij heeft
5592755 ik heb mij niet voorbereid met veel vasten veel gebeden en liefdadigheid maar ik houd van allah swt en zijn profeet vzmh
5592756 zeg allah is de enige allah is de onafhankelijke hij verwekte niet noch werd hij verwekt en niemand is hem in enige opzichte gelijk
5592757 als mijn heer mij niet de goede richting wijst zal ik zeker tot de mensen behoren die dwalen
5592758 o mensen ik heb niets te maken met de afgoderij die jullie bedrijven
5592759 mijn heer is hij die leven geeft en doet sterven
5592760 nu allah doet de zon van het oosten opgaan doe jij haar van het westen opgaan
5592761 iedere profeet heeft een smeekbede alle smeekbeden van de profeten zijn door allah aanvaard mijn smeekbede heb ik bewaard voor mijn oemma volk voor shafaa op de dag des oordeels
5592762 wie ongelovig is aan allah zijn engelen zijn boeken zijn boodschappers en de laatste dag die is waarlijk zeer ver afgedwaald
5592763 alles wat er op deze wereld gebeurt of het nou onzichtbaar of zichtbaar is is de daad van engelen die naar de bevelen van allah handelen
5592764 het boek dat wij aan u hebben geopenbaard is vol van zegeningen laat hen dus over zijn verzen nadenken en laat de verstandigen er lering uit trekken
5592765 voorwaar wij zijn het die de vermaning de koran hebben nedergezonden
5592766 voorwaar wij boden de hemelen de aarde en de bergen aan hun iets toe te vertrouwen maar zij weigerden dit te dragen en vreesden er voor maar de mens nam het op zich
5592767 als wij deze koran tot een berg hadden neergezonden dan had jij deze zich zeker zien onderwerpen en zich splijten uit vrees voor allah
5592768 dit is een volmaakt boek daaraan is geen twijfel een richtsnoer voor de godvrezenden
5592769 dit is een gezegend boek dat wij aan jou hebben nedergezonden opdat zij zijn verzen zullen overpeinzen en opdat de bezitters van verstand er lering uit trekken
5592770 degene die geloven en niet hun geloof met onrecht mengen zij zijn degenen die veiligheid toekomt en zij zijn de rechtgeleiden
5592771 oh boodschapper van allah wie onder ons de gelovigen doet zijn ziel geen onrecht aan
5592772 ik zweer bij allah geprezen en verheven is hij naast wie er geen god is van elke surah weet ik waar het is geopenbaard en van elk ayah vers in de koran weet ik de reden van openbaring als er een persoon is die meer kennis heeft over de koran dan ik dan zal ik zeker naar hem toegaan om zijn kennis te vergaren als dat binnen mijn bereik ligt
5592773 oh mensen er is voor jullie waarlijk een bewijs van jullie rabb gekomen en wij hebben een duidelijk licht de koran over jullie doen neerdalen
5592774 o mensen voorzeker er is een vermaning van jullie rabb tot jullie gekomen en een genezing voor wat in jullie harten is en leiding en barmhartigheid voor de gelovigen
5592775 en wij zenden dat van de koran neer welke een genezing en barmhartigheid voor de gelovigen is
5592776 voorwaar wij hebben in waarheid het boek voor de mensen aan jou gezonden wie dan de leiding aanvaardt het is ten gunste van zichzelf maar wie dwaalt hij dwaalt slechts tegen zichzelf
5592777 deze koran is een duidelijke aanwijzing voor de mensheid en leiding en barmhartigheid voor een volk dat overtuigd is
5592778 dit is de openbaring die god aan die en die gaf
5592779 het woord van de heer kwam naar jonas de zoon van elmitaeh
5592780 vele mensen hebben geschreven over deze man het lijkt me daarom passend dat ik dit ook doe
5592781 deze woorden komen van god en hier zijn ze dit is een openbaring
5592782 al sinds je een jonge man was heb je de schriften bestudeerd alle schriften die ge nspireerd zijn door god
5592783 iedereen die iets wegneemt van dit boek of er iets aan toevoegt is vervloekt
5592784 het gras wordt dor de bloemen vervagen maar het word van onze god zal voor altijd blijven bestaan
5592785 dit is het boek waaraan geen twijfel is een leidraad voor degenen die zich van god bewust zijn
5592786 denken zij dan niet na over de quran en wanneer die niet van allah afkomstig was dan zouden zij hierin vele fouten vinden
5592787 zeggen zie dit en dat zeg hun dan dit en dat
5592788 o mensheid sta stil bij dit of dit heb je nagedacht over dit en dit
5592789 jezus was god want hij werd in de hemel opgenomen
5592790 je hebt god nog nooit gezien en je hebt nog nooit zijn stem gehoord
5592791 zijn vijanden zeiden het dus hij zal het ook wel gezegd hebben
5592792 toen isra l jong was hield ik van hem en vanuit egypte riep ik mijn zoon
5592793 hoe ziet mijn vader eruit dan is hij lang of kort heeft hij een bril
5592794 oh ja je hebt gelijk je hebt hem inderdaad ontmoet
5592795 bewijs het maar vertel me iets zodat ik het weet dat ik zeker weet dat u erbij was toen het universum begon
5592796 voorzeker wij bouwden de hemel door onze macht en waarlijk wij zijn het die hem uitbreiden
5592797 maar van dien dag en die ure weet niemand noch de engelen die in den hemel zijn noch de zoon dan de vader
5592798 de engelen zijn uit licht geschapen de djinn zijn uit rookloos vuur geschapen en adam is geschapen uit hetgeen aan jullie omschreven is
5592799 vrede zij u gaat de hemel binnen voor hetgeen gij deed
5592800 vrede zij over u omdat gij geduldig waart ziet hoe uitstekend is het uiteindelijke tehuis
5592801 ik ben met u versterkt de gelovigen ik boezem ontzag in de harten der ongelovigen slaat daarom hun hoofd af en slaat alle toppen van hun vingers af
5592802 de engelen gaan geen huis is waarin een hond of een afbeelding is
5592803 wij hebben jou slechts gezonden uit genade voor de hele mensheid maar de meeste mensen begrijpen het niet
5592804 door vriendelijke woorden tegen hen te spreken hen vriendelijk te behandelen en je verschijning aantrekkelijk voor hen te maken net zoals je ervan houdt dat zij dat voor jullie doen
5592805 een gelovige man moet geen afkeer hebben van zijn gelovige vrouw als hij van sommige zaken die zij doet niet houdt zal hij zeker van andere zaken wel houden
5592806 waarlijk de doenja het wereldse leven is slechts een genieting en er is geen betere genieting in de doenja dan een vrome vrouw
5592807 hij die gelooft in allah en de laatste dag moet zijn buurman niet tot last zijn en neem mijn advies aan wat betreft de goede behandeling van vrouwen want ze zijn geschapen uit een rib en het meest gebogen deel van de rib is het bovenste gedeelte als je probeert om het recht te krijgen zul je het breken en als je het met rust laat zal het gebogen blijven neem dus mijn advies aan wat betreft de goede behandeling van vrouwen
5592808 als je van haar geniet dan zal dat zijn wanneer er iets gebogens in haar blijft maar als je probeert haar recht te buigen dan breek je haar en haar breken is haar scheiden
5592809 wees vriendelijk voor de vrouwen want je hebt hen genomen door het verbond met allah en hebt het recht op seksuele omgang met hen gekregen door het woord van allah
5592810 de profeet sallallahoe aleihi wa sallem sloeg nooit zijn vrouwen of zijn slaven in feite hief hij nooit zijn hand naar iemand op behalve voor de zaak van allah of wanneer de verboden van allah werden overtreden en hij wraak nam namens allah
5592811 de slechtste positie van de mensen voor allah op de dag der opstanding is de man die gemeenschap heeft met zijn vrouw en zij met hem en daarna verspreidt hij haar geheimen
5592812 o boodschapper van allah wat zijn de rechten van de vrouw van n van ons op haar echtgenoot
5592813 je moet haar te eten geven wanneer je zelf eet haar kleden wanneer je jezelf kleedt haar niet in haar gezicht slaan en haar niet uitschelden of alleen laten behalve in het huis
5592814 niemand van jullie mag zijn vrouw slaan zoals een slaaf wordt geslagen en dan aan het eind van de dag gemeenschap met haar hebben
5592815 van de zaken die toegestaan halaal zijn is de echtscheiding het meest gehaat door allah
5592816 het verspillen van het levensonderhoud van degenen die van hem afhankelijk zijn is genoeg zonde voor een man
5592817 wanneer een man wiens dien jou tevreden stelt naar je toe komt en je vraagt om je dochter te mogen trouwen laat haar dan met hem trouwen anders zal corruptie zich over de aarde verspreiden
5592818 rasoelallah sallallahoe aleihi wa sallem verdeelde zijn bezoeken aan zijn vrouwen op rechtvaardige wijze en zei
5592819 o mijn neef rasoelallah sallallahoe aleihi wa sallem gaf niet aan n van ons de voorkeur boven de anderen wat betreft de tijd die hij met ons doorbracht het kwam zelden voor dat hij ons niet allemaal bezocht en zijn vrouwen benaderde zonder gemeenschap met ze te hebben totdat hij tenslotte de vrouw bezocht wiens dag het was en de nacht met haar doorbracht
5592820 eenieder die twee vrouwen heeft en ze niet rechtvaardig behandelt zal op de dag der opstanding verschijnen terwijl hij een deel van zijn lichaam dat naar beneden hangt met zich mee sleept
5592821 een man is raa in leider verantwoordelijke over zijn familie en is verantwoordelijk voor zijn leiderschap
5592822 de besten onder jullie zijn degenen die het beste voor hun vrouwen zijn
5592823 zal ik jullie vertellen wie de besten onder jullie zijn de vriendelijke man en degene met een goed karakter die zijn vrouw eervol behandelt wanneer hij ertoe in staat is
5592824 de meest geliefde aanbiddende dienaar is voor allah degene die het beste is voor zijn familie
5592825 er is niemand van jullie die drie dochters of zusters heeft en goed voor hen is zonder dat hij het paradijs binnengaat
5592826 de slechtste man is degene die zijn familie depressief maakt
5592827 wanneer de man zijn huis binnengaat wordt zijn vrouw nederig rent zijn kind weg en verstopt zijn bediende zich maar wanneer hij zijn huis verlaat lacht zijn vrouw en zijn familie wordt vrolijk en komt tezamen
5592828 waarlijk ik haat de man die kwaad is en die over zijn vrouw neergebogen staat met zijn slagaderen opgezwollen terwijl hij haar slaat
5592829 en dwingt uw slavinnen terwijl zij kuis wensen te zijn niet tot ontucht om de goederen van het tegenwoordige leven te zoeken
5592830 allah has forgiven for my ummah for their mistakes what they forget and what they are forced to do
5592831 the onus to provide evidence falls on the one who makes a claim and the one who denies the same can absolve himself or herself by making a solemn oath to the contrary
5592832 and those who accuse their wives and have no witnesses but themselves then the testimony of each of them shall be a testimony sworn by god repeated four times that he is indeed truthful and the fifth oath is that gods curse be upon him if he is lying and it shall avert punishment from her that she testify a testimony repeated and sworn by god four times that he is lying and a fifth oath that the wrath of god be upon her if he has spoken the truth

5592836 toen hij werd geboren was er een licht dat scheen vanuit mijn schaamstreek en de paleizen van syri verlichtte
5592837 het was een jaar van droogte en hongersnood en we hadden niets te eten
5592838 we brachten hem terug naar zijn moeder en verzochten haar ernstig om hem bij ons te laten blijven en ons baat te laten hebben van het geluk en de zegeningen die hij ons had gebracht we drongen aan bij ons verzoek dat we motiveerden door onze ongerustheid over het kind uit te spreken dat hij een bepaalde infectie die in mekka veel voorkwam zou oplopen 7 uiteindelijk werd onze wens vervuld en de profeet s a w bleef bij ons totdat hij ongeveer vier of vijf jaar oud was
5592839 in de schaduw van was een matras gelegd voor abdoel moettalib zijn kinderen zaten gewoonlijk om de matras heen uit eerbied voor hun vader maar mohammed s a w zat er gewoonlijk op zijn ooms haalden hem dan terug maar als abdoel moettalib aanwezig was zei hij laat mijn kleinzoon ik zweer bij allah dat deze jongen een veelbetekenende positie zal bekleden hij liet de jongen gewoonlijk op zijn matras zitten klopte hem op de rug en was altijd tevreden met wat de jongen deed
5592840 ik kwam naar mekka in een jaar waarin het niet regende dus de qoeraisj zeiden oh aboe talib de vallei is bladloos geworden en de kinderen zijn hongerig laat ons gaan bidden om regen aboe talib ging naar met een jonge knaap die zo mooi als de zon was en een zwarte wolk hing boven zijn hoofd aboe talib en de jongen stonden bij de muur van en baden om regen onmiddellijk verzamelden de wolken zich vanuit alle richtingen en er viel zware regen en dat veroorzaakte de komst van bronnen en de groei van planten in de stad en het land
5592841 dit is de meester van alle mensen allah zal hem met een boodschap die een genade voor alle wezens zal zijn sturen
5592842 toen jullie uit de richting van aqabah tevoorschijn kwamen wierpen alle stenen en alle bomen zich ter aarde wat zij nooit doen behalve voor een profeet ik kan hem ook herkennen aan het zegel van het profeetschap dat onder zijn schouder zit als een appel wij hebben dit uit onze boeken geleerd
5592843 ik ben getuige geweest van een confederatie in het huis van abdoellah ibn djadaan het sprak mij meer aan dan grote kuddes vee zelfs nu in de periode van de islam zou ik zon bijeenkomst bijwonen als ik werd uitgenodigd
5592844 laat degene die het heiligdom als eerste binnenkomt over dit punt beslissen
5592845 al amien de betrouwbare is gekomen wij zijn er tevreden mee ons aan zijn beslissing te houden
5592846 ik heb nooit geprobeerd te doen wat mijn volk doet op twee keer na iedere keer kwam allah tussenbeiden en weerhield mij ervan dat te doen en ik deed het nooit weer eens vroeg ik aan mijn medeherder om voor mijn schapen te zorgen toen we in het bovenste deel van mekka waren ik wilde naar beneden naar mekka gaan en mijzelf amuseren zoals de jongemannen deden ik ging naar het eerste huis in mekka waar ik muziek hoorde ik ging binnen en vroeg wat is dit iemand antwoordde het is een bruiloft ik ging zitten en luisterde maar viel al snel in een diepe slaap ik werd gewekt door de hitte van de zon ik ging terug naar mijn medeherder en vertelde hem wat mij was overkomen ik heb het nooit meer geprobeerd
5592847 terwijl de mensen verbouwden ging de profeet mohammed s a w met abbaas wat stenen dragen abbaas zei draag je lendendoek om je nek om je tegen de stenen te beschermen terwijl hij dat deed viel de profeet s a w op de grond neer en zijn ogen keerden zich naar de lucht later ontwaakte hij en schreeuwde mijn lendendoek mijn lendendoek hij wikkelde zichzelf in zijn lendendoek
5592848 hij verenigt tegenstrijdige relaties hij helpt de armen en de behoeftigen hij onthaalt de gasten gastvrij en hij verdraagt moeilijkheden op het pad van de waarheidsgetrouwheid
5592849 toen nam hij mij en omhelsde mij stevig toen liet hij mij gaan en herhaalde het bevel lees
5592850 allah zal jou nooit vernederen jij verenigt de verbroken relaties jij draagt de last van de zwakken jij helpt de armen en behoeftigen jij onthaalt de gasten gastvrij en verdraagt de moeilijkheden op het pad van de waarheidsgetrouwheid
5592851 dit is namoes d w z de engel aan wie de goddelijke geheimen worden toevertrouwd die allah naar moesa stuurde ik wilde dat ik jonger was ik wilde dat ik kon leven tot aan de tijd dat jouw mensen je uit zullen leveren
5592852 iedereen die met iets dat vergelijkbaar als wat jij hebt gebracht kwam werd vijandig bejegend en als ik tot die dag in leven blijf zal ik je krachtig ondersteunen
5592853 ik heb nooit iemand meer verafschuwd dan een dichter of een geesteszieke man
5592854 oh mohammed jij bent inderdaad de boodschapper van allah in de waarheid
5592855 dat het stoppen van de openbaring van allah voor enige dagen was om de boodschapper van allah s
5592856 terwijl ik liep hoorde ik een stem uit de lucht komen
5592857 o jij ommantelde sta op en waarschuw en verheerlijk jouw heer en reinig jouw kleden en blijf weg van de afgoden
5592858 de edele geest openbaarde aan mij geen ziel zal vergaan totdat die zijn levensloop heeft uitgeput dus vrees allah en verzoek hem vriendelijk
5592859 o jij ommantelde sta op en waarschuw en verheerlijk jouw heer en reinig jouw kleden en blijf weg van de afgoden
5592860 toen gingen de mensen in massas tegelijk de omarming van de islam binnen mannen en vrouwen en het nieuwe geloof kon niet langer geheim worden gehouden
5592861 de salaat het gebed was al in een vroeg stadium van de islamitische oproep als een verplicht ritueel ingesteld een salaat van twee rakaat gebedsonderdeel in de morgen en hetzelfde in de avond
5592862 en verheerlijk en lofprijs jullie heer in de avond en in de ochtend
5592863 het is absoluut zeker dat de profeet s a w de gewoonte had te bidden voor de nachtelijke reis maar het blijft een controversi le kwestie rondom de vraag of het gebed al als een verplicht ritueel was ingesteld voor het opleggen van de regelgeving betreffende de gewone vijf gebeden per dag er is overgeleverd dat het verplichte gebed op twee keer per dag s morgens voor zonsopgang en na zonsondergang was vastgesteld
5592864 de waarheid is onoverwinnelijk toen de bezieling van het profeetschap naar mekka kwam werd hij tegengewerkt door de voorstanders van de zonde maar de waarheid in tegenstelling tot leugens kan niet anders dan blijven terwijl leugens zeker vergankelijk zijn
5592865 dit zijn jouw ooms en neven spreek ter zake doende maar ten eerste moet je weten dat jouw verwanten niet in een positie zijn om alle arabieren te weerstaan een ander punt dat je in gedachten moet houden is dat jouw verwanten voldoende voor jou zijn als je hun gebruiken volgt zal het gemakkelijker voor hen zijn dan om de andere clans van de qoeraisj onder ogen te komen die worden ondersteund door de andere arabieren waarlijk ik heb nooit gehoord over iemand die zijn verwanten meer schade heeft toegebracht dan jij
5592866 ik huldig de lof van allah ik zoek zijn hulp ik geloof in hem ik stel mijn vertrouwen in hem ik getuig dat er geen god is die aanbeden mag worden behalve allah die geen partner heeft een gids kan nooit liegen tegen zijn mensen ik zweer bij allah er is geen god behalve hij dat ik als een boodschapper naar jullie in het bijzonder en naar de mensen in het algemeen ben gestuurd ik zweer bij allah jullie zullen sterven net zoals jullie slapen jullie zullen worden opgewekt net zoals jullie ontwaken jullie zullen rekenschap moeten afleggen over jullie daden het is ofwel de hel voor altijd of de tuin het paradijs voor altijd
5592867 wij zullen je met liefde helpen jouw advies accepteren en in jouw woorden geloven dit zijn jouw bloedverwanten die je hebt bijeengebracht en ik ben n van hen maar ik ben de eerste om te doen wat jou pleziert doe wat je bevolen is ik zal je beschermen en verdedigen maar ik kan de religie van abdoel moettalib niet opgeven
5592868 ik zweer bij allah dat dit iets slechts is je moet hem stoppen voordat anderen dat doen
5592869 ik zweer bij allah dat ik hem zal beschermen zolang ik leef
5592870 verkondig daarom openlijk dat wat je opgedragen is en keer je af van afgodenaanbidders

5592874 we wanted to create short informative podcasts that were entertaining enough to view while still delivering cruise information without the podcasts coming off as a corporate style commercial thats why i wanted to host these podcasts its not often you see a ceo getting hands on i wanted to show who we are i was also fortunate to recruit johnny favourite on this project considering he spent a good amount of time working on cruise ships he has the experience and with his wacky personality i figured we would deliver podcasts that people want to watch
5592875 i feel that many of the modern day websites are getting more difficult to navigate we are keeping the pages very basic with a good amount of information on one page even though it may be a long scroll page everything a future cruiser might want to know about a specific cruise line is right there plus they can click though 18 different cruise lines all on one website instead of surfing from site to site

5592973 carl pavano has worked his butt off hes always tried he just hasnt stayed healthy no one is trying to avoid him when hes healthy he can pitch hes one of the hardest workers weve got people dont want to realize it or look at it but thats true
5592974 he hasnt laid down on us he just hasnt been healthy people lose their objectivity and make it things its not the bottom line is hes had every intention of helping us but between all the injuries weve had a lot of stuff that hasnt worked physically when hes healthy he can do what few can do
5592975 hughes was pitching with a bug he wasnt going to say it though

5592996 but now dispensationalism and modern naturalistic hermeneutics must also be defeated for this will be the factor that will energize the evangelization of the remaining nations of the world which still lie crushed in the hegemonic grip of islam

5593011 christ redeemed us from the curse of the law so that the blessing of abraham might be to the nations
5593012 verses 13 14 the blessing of abraham comes to the nations because they are in christ christ is the seed of abraham therefore if we are in christ we too are the seed of abraham by virtue of our relationship in christ we not ethnic jews or arabs are abrahams true children and heirs
5593013 not because they are the seed of abraham are they all children
5593014 your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw and was glad
5593015 behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they will be his people and god himself will be with them and be their god
5593016 it would have benefitted the later descendants of abraham who presumed upon the favor of god by virtue of their genealogy to have considered well this point
5593017 see it does matter that we are jewish because ishmael was excluded from the promise therefore the
5593018 where are the many nations coming from if only isaac is allowed to be the child of promise and in this line of reasoning should i wonder if the physical line really means anything one bloodline doesnt equal many nations whats going on here
5593019 abraham believed god and it was counted to him as righteousness
5593020 weep no more behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has conquered so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals
5593021 worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals for you were slain and by your blood you ransomed people for god from every tribe and language and people and nation rev 5 10 and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our god and they shall reign on the earth
5593022 by you israel will pronounce blessings saying god make you as ephraim and as manasseh
5593023 the bus was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge at the bottom and from what i can see at the scene that bus has not managed to go round the bend and has careered through a wall and down a drop into a garden
5593024 theres a bus in a difficult situation which crews have had to secure and obviously the crews are working very hard in difficult circumstances
5593025 i heard this massive crash rumble of either crunching metal or what sounded to me initially as a thunderstorm as it was heavily raining before
5593026 then after that we heard shouts and screams so we obviously put it down to a crash
5593027 when i got to the scene there was a bus overturned it looked like it had ploughed into a car and then down a neighbors driveway into the garden
5593028 it must have dropped about 20ft 6m it was on a slope its diagonal not head first
5593029 there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus there were many walking wounded all being seen to by the ambulance staff
5593030 i went to the front door and there was there was about 12 to 15 people all crying hysterically blood running down their faces and their arms and they couldnt speak english but they were able to say
5593031 its a narrow country road its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour of rain just before it happened
5593032 i was in the local pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets
5593033 we all went to help but the area had been cordoned off by police
5593034 unless i am convinced by the testimony of the scriptures or by clear reason i am bound by the scriptures i have quoted and my conscience is captive to the word of god i cannot and i will not retract anything since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience i cannot do otherwise here i stand may god help me
5593035 unless i am convinced by the testimony of the scriptures or by clear reason i am bound by the scriptures i have quoted and my conscience is captive to the word of god
5593036 here i stand i cannot do otherwise may god help me
5593037 i want you formally to recognize certain persons as kingdom heirs i want you to do so through baptism and i forbid you to exclude the infant children of those who believe in me as kingdom heirs i want you to recognize them also as possessors of the kingdom
5593038 because these persons possess covenant realities something which it would be impossible to possess and not be a member of the church it would be wrong to forbid them the covenant sign of baptism
5593039 even to as many as the lord our god shall call
5593040 because the head of the household believed the whole household was baptized
5593041 not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt
5593042 it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience i cannot do otherwise here i stand may god help me
5593043 you are a full participant of the saving effects of the atonement
5593044 you are outside of the redeemed community alien to the people of god
5593045 we have no choice but to recognize that christ shed his blood to put a heart of faith in all those who would be included in the covenant
5593046 you make a good point about luke 18 i am not sure how to answer it at this point
5593047 the position advocated in this book is that baptism is not a major doctrine that should be the basis of division among genuine christians but it is nonetheless a matter of importance for ordinary church life and it is appropriate that we give it full consideration
5593048 treats of the underlying presuppositions and linguistic considerations inherent in arriving at one or the other viewpoint
5593049 what replaces physical circumcision is not another physical symbol but
5593050 i believe the scriptures are laid out simply enough for a child to understand
5593051 wine is something big people drink you know like coke and coffee
5593052 wine is an icky drink that only people that dont love jesus drink
5593053 too afraid or stubborn to give the bible supreme authority and seek to know its every precept
5593054 if god wanted us to baptize infants he would have said so
5593055 for as many of you as were baptized into christ have put on christ
5593056 if you are christs then you are abrahams offspring heirs according to promise
5593057 allow them read ta brefe to come unto me for of such read of the brefe and others like them is the kingdom of heaven
5593058 could the baptism in this context be water baptism or must it not be the reality which water baptism only signifies
5593059 i have been baptized i have been incorporated into christ i am your child
5593060 behold the days are coming declares the lord when i will punish all those who are circumcised merely in the flesh
5593061 look the textual evidence supports paedo baptism so you better go for paedo baptism
5593062 when it comes to eschatology i land like a butterfly with sore feet
5593063 you are living in sin and are unable to be a part of the church
5593064 well were not sure if this is doing any good and i know half of you dont think this is a legitimate member of the covenant community but here goes hand me that eye dropper
5593065 for example if baptizing a baby the pastor can give the whys and wherefores and request that the congregation honor the parents desire to see the child included in the church family if baptizing a 7 year old who has recently professed faith the pastor can speak of believers baptism need i remind that we all agree on this and what it signifies
5593066 it would appear from a perusal of the book of acts that the church is made up of those who have embraced christ as lord and whom the holy spirit has incorporated into christs body the different churches that are spoken of as mutually exclusive of each other are merely so indicated for necessary geographical reasons
5593067 youre wrong enough that you cant be included in my church congregation
5593068 im right enough to not have to extend the totality of christs love to you
5593069 i think you may still be bringing too many preconceived american notions to bear on the question
5593070 as far as the concerns of who would shepherd such believers what church polity would look like etc i would suggest that anyone biblically qualified with a sound grasp of scriptures and a heart to exercise the office of an elder would be fitted to shepherd the church
5593071 anyone biblically qualified with a sound grasp of scriptures and a heart to exercise the office of an elder
5593072 and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire
5593073 do these things affect the purity of the gospel directly perhaps not but they are extremely important and affect a whole variety of areas ecclesiology eschatology outreach etc
5593074 do i run around calling those who disagree in these areas sinners
5593075 by the way does anyones wife have a submit button
5593076 i am not endorsing an ect like embracing of catholics but perhaps luthers desire to reform instead of separate was guided not from an mistaken adherence to his catholic background but from a desire to not divide what he felt could be simply corrected
5593077 if we ourselves admit that its unimportant to the gospel itself why do we let our practice play out like its more important than the gospel
5593078 one cannot be too careful when dealing with issues that although they seem petty are still important
5593079 you would fit in better with this other church next to us i trust you are a true christian but because you do not believe doctrine x you are not a member of this church
5593080 do you mean you would have someone speak at your church who did not espouse the doctrines of grace
5593081 i would contend that a local church is comprised of every single believer in a close geographical area and that the only authority humans in the church have to recognize membership or the lack thereof is by a mature bibilical analysis of whether or not a person is a genuine christian
5593082 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls
5593083 your statement seems to imply perhaps you did not so intend it and if not please forgive my assumption that those believers who have unbiblical doctrine are not part of the same body of christ with those believers who have more doctrinal understanding
5593084 just leave them alone and let them do their own thing
5593085 we are all brothers and sisters in christ and our unity in the gospel is precious and indissoluble
5593086 or would you keep teaching your flock the doctrines you felt were biblical although in disagreement with the other church
5593087 is it likely that the disciples would have baptised stephanas and lydia and also anyone else in the household whether or not that person had become a believer on the basis that they were members of the households alone is it likely that they would have done this given that jesus command to them was to baptise disciples i e those who actually believed
5593088 here is some water what is to keep me from being baptised
5593089 lest in doing so we expose the soul of the child to the risk of eternal perdition
5593090 nothing grieves me more than at present i have to baptise children for i know it ought not to be done
5593091 if however i were to terminate the practice then i fear i would lose my prebend his stipend
5593092 all that is really necessary grammatically is that the baptizing and teaching present participles be included as integral parts of the making of disciples discipleship is occuring when these two things are taking place but of the specific order of the events i think you have to take a few too many liberties with the grammar to speak dogmatically from this text at any rate i think the first option is patently impossible the text does not imply a three part process make a disciple then baptize him then teach him in a manner that is mutually exlusive to making him a disciple rather one basic function disciple making that involves at least two elements as integral parts of the one essential activity
5593093 because these persons possess covenant realities something which it would be impossible to possess and not be a member of the church it would be wrong to forbid them the covenant sign of baptism if christ said of infant children of believers that they possess covenant realities the kingdom of heaven then it would be likewise wrong to forbid them the covenant sign of baptism
5593094 reformed view ie presbyterian i am not well studied on this and get very confused with respect to the convenant view which i grasp but i am still confused about regeneration issues may 27th 2006 at 6 17 pm
5593095 due to some of the same discussions that were raised in this blog
5593096 question 2 perhaps a little indirectly 77 i think his answer is god commands us to apply the sign of the covenant to those who belong to it
5593097 if it was good enough for jesus it is good enough for me
5593098 put your opinion into what you think the bible says
5593099 may i seize this opportunity to thank the catholic church i feel happy to speak before thousands of catholic faithful persons that have contributed their prayer so that today the angolans feel the positive deeds of this greatest good achieved six years ago
5593100 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed

5593107 nor is there any forecast or other financial information which could assist shareholders in valuing the company and making a timely and informed decision
5593108 origin is a strongly performing australian integrated energy company with an impressive track record of growth
5593109 origin has failed to demonstrate any confidence that the coal seam gas monetisation process will yield superior value for its shareholders
5593110 theres a sense that origin has gotten quite a positive response on its csg monetisation process but thats still in early days so its hard to decide which is a better option
5593111 its going to be like that for the next three too
5593112 were trying to play with a chip on our shoulder we go out every night and try to get better
5593113 i expect them to play hard to play tough theyre not intimidated they wont back down theyll come ready to play
5593114 they run a continuity offense theyre very proficient at it they run hard cuts set hard picks theyre very smart it will be a different ball game
5593115 we know argentina is a very experienced team we hope to have a little revenge because they knocked us out in the last olympic tournament in greece in our home
5593116 when you play a team like argentina the first thing no mistakes patience and try to have a clear mind on every pass and every time you defend
5593117 it will be a difficult game they have a lot of players that can change the game everyone of them that means we need a lot of concentration
5593118 i kept busy attending camps i went to south florida where i worked out and threw for coach leavitt my parents and i flew out to tampa and it was a one day kind of things
5593119 the coaching staff showed me around the campus but it was kind of short because i had to catch a flight almost as soon as i got done with the mini camp
5593120 i attended camps at u of h louisiana tech rice smu and texas tech
5593121 they all went really well im mainly just focusing on having a great year
5593122 my top three choices would probably be one south florida followed by the university of houston and smu
5593123 the south florida coaches told me they were waiting told me they were waiting on two other guys to see what they would do i guess i was the number three before nathan scheelhasse committed elsewhere so i guess that bumps me up to number two for them
5593124 if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin
5593125 snatch them from the fire and so i have this new theory
5593126 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5593127 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5593128 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5593129 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5593130 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5593131 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5593132 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5593133 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5593134 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5593135 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5593136 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5593137 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5593138 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5593139 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5593140 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5593141 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5593142 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5593143 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5593144 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5593145 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5593151 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5593152 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5593153 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5593154 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5593155 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5593156 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5593157 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5593158 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5593159 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5593160 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5593161 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5593162 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5593163 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5593164 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5593165 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5593166 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5593167 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5593168 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5593169 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5593170 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5593171 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5593172 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5593173 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5593174 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5593175 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5593176 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5593177 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5593178 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5593179 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5593180 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5593181 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5593182 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5593183 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5593184 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5593185 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5593186 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5593187 in simple terms school refusal is absenteeism where children complain of physical symptoms or express fear about going to school
5593188 its different from truancy because these kids generally stay home with their parents knowledge
5593189 certainly the continued growth of cdhps is a key headline to come out of this years survey
5593190 fee for service and exclusive provider organizations now virtually disappeared from the market and hmos are losing ground as employers seek to help contain the rising cost of health care and insurance premiums
5593191 across the board were seeing a trend toward employee empowerment and participation when it comes to health care
5593192 theyre taking more control over health care expenditures by increasing participation in cdhps and they are also realizing that there are financial benefits in addition to health benefits of participating in wellness programs as the 2008 presidential election approaches and health care costs and plans continue to be a focus of national attention we only anticipate that employees will look even harder at their own health plans designs and costs

5593199 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5593200 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5593201 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5593202 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5593203 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5593204 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5593205 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5593206 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5593207 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5593208 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5593209 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5593210 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5593211 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5593212 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5593213 who are open to doing something on the production side
5593214 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5593215 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5593216 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

5593219 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5593220 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5593221 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5593222 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5593223 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5593224 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5593225 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

5593293 i remember my first year 1997 minnesota vikings i was just happy to be running out into the stadium
5593294 in april it was reported that the fbi had been focusing on as many as four suspects
5593295 confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
5593296 i was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described the tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years this is not spin this is not true
5593297 the fbi has completely shut congress out of its investigation into anthrax attacks on capitol hill and around the nation
5593298 scientists in and out of government say the rush to destroy the spores may have eliminated crucial evidence about the anthrax in the letters sent to congress and the media
5593299 this was an astonishing thing to do it should have been preserved as evidence this was a roadmap of everybody and anybody that had gotten access to develop the super strain that hit leahy and daschle
5593300 fbi scientists early on had but destroyed the unique strain of anthrax used in the deadly 2001 attacks that years later would lead them to dr bruce ivins this was anthrax that ivins took from his army lab in february 2002 and gave investigators
5593301 the only thing i can do is keep concentrating on learning the offensive playbook which i think i have a good grasp ive spent some good time with drew its going to be fun weve got a lot of time like i said this week im going to push it a little bit more just to see how it goes from there
5593302 looking at it from a fans point of view id probably boo myself too
5593303 the fans have a high expectation and so do i and the coaching staff
5593304 this is the nfl its part of the game theres no one to blame but myself im the only who can really stop the boos it has nothing to do with the coaches it has nothing to do with the players its pretty much just me
5593305 let there be no doubt these are dangerous individuals these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism

5593308 it is a pretty amazing place full of people who really look after their bodies
5593309 i just feel so sorry because there were so many people supporting me i told myself i had to run but i just couldnt do it
5593310 it was unbearable if i had finished the race i would have risked my tendon i could not describe my feeling at that moment
5593311 i never quit easily i am not that type of person
5593312 i think there will be a day when i will be better i think now the main thing is to quicken the recovery process to make the achilles tendon better
5593313 there will be more opportunities next year there will be more opportunities later i must be optimistic i cant complain about destiny
5593314 im one that cant accept failure easily i will rise up its in my character
5593315 to withdraw from a race is not to give up liu xiang had no choice and this was a moment of great courage

5593319 i thought our guys were really quite switched on in their roles defensively i thought our backs were really sound they were prepared to come off their men and assist at times and we quite regularly saw two on ones three on one scenarios happening where backmen went to franklin and were able to do the job those who played on roughy were really quite solid on him as well
5593320 four quarter wise that was the thing that we were more pleased about that from start to finish we sort of got the job done the way we wanted to
5593321 i was really surprised i must say when i picked up the papers and saw id taken aim at them i didnt think it was that at all

5593331 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5593332 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use
5593333 for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but it s not normal
5593334 nothing like going to a starbucks and looking at all the books

5593349 this is a difficult decision because of the great significance it has for mr schalchlin
5593350 i respect judge mathesons decision im sure it was a well though out decision
5593351 at this point were going to focus on the larger aspect of the trial which is actually the trial
5593352 it makes me happy that hes being charged as an adult
5593353 its been tough my niece is having a particularly hard time but were helping her through it
5593354 i do feel its fair because he had choices and he made the wrong choice and needs to pay the consequences for his actions
5593355 the seriousness of this crime this alleged crime outweighed the interest of interest of mr schalchlin had he remained in juvenile court
5593356 it is a relief to think he will be off the streets for quite some time
5593357 i am a star trek fan and dragged my family husband and 16 year old son to this experience and had to apologise afterwards for wasting their time never mind it costs 40 each just for the basic experience its just exploitation

5593360 it is not hard to see england failing to qualify for 2010 just as in the 1970s when we missed 74 and 78 world cups through a mixture of arrogance bad management awful tactics inferior skill level and an over reliance on the same old faces
5593361 england must get over that psychological barrier sure therell be games when we dont play well but you need to feel that even when things arent going to plan youre going to win the game its something we need to improve on i wouldnt say that any one player lacks confidence or belief when he puts on an england shirt but i just think that while you can improve your technical and fitness stuff we need to improve our mentality as a team were trying to do it were not burying our heads in the sand were going out there and trying to play getting the ball down and trying to build we need to stay cool and calm and keep going forward its pigeon steps going forward a little bit every time the world cup isnt for another couple of years so we dont want to be peaking too early we just want little bits of improvement every time and by the time we get there hopefully well be in a better position than we are in now technically physically and mentally
5593362 john terry one hundred per cent i went on record before the last world cup and nothing has changed hes still a great leader a great footballer a great man i think you can see it on the pitch john terry can lead and organise better than anyone else hes a bit more vocal he has communication skills he attacks the ball hes strong hes quick he has the experience now i think hes a good leader if there is a captain there to help you win the football game then you make him captain its simple and if i want to win football games then i would have jt as my skipper
5593363 rooney is the best england have but what to do with him
5593364 sir alex believes current united squad dont need any new players to triumph this season
5593365 englands most unflappable and immaculate captain bobby moore is the only one so far to have lifted a major trophy the parallel with ferdinand has obvious flaws but the united centre back is accomplished enough to be unflappable and with his anticipation and manoeuvrability he is usually first to the ball despite the calm manner he does seem stable too and served his punishment in full for that missed drugs test with his exclusion from euro 2004 the odd lapse is still conceivable and it is a pity that a defender of his quality did not have sharp enough peripheral vision to spot a police car before passing it at 105mph ferdinand received a short driving ban for that offence in 2005
5593366 before capello informs ferdinand and john terry who will be england captain today the coach must take into account ferdinands broader appeal in a dressing room packed with disparate characters terry is a good leader an old school sleeves rolled warrior type and capello has been impressed with the way the chelsea captain has fought back from the heartache of that missed penalty in moscow naturally vocal and combative terry does not need the armband to bring out his leadership qualities but the captaincy will make ferdinand an even better player it seems to accentuate his concentration levels
5593367 there has been a growing sense around the england set up in the past few weeks that terry with his strong displays at the end of last season and the way he has conducted himself may have done enough to convince the italian that he should be retained if terry succeeds in doing so it will represent a remarkable comeback for the 27 year old after the d b cle of the steve mcclaren regime he had clearly fallen behind ferdinand in capellos thinking and at one stage was accused of moping around last night however sources continued to stress that it was too close to call between the pair
5593368 the decision is not an easy one not least because he must know that ferdinand and terry would do a perfectly good job but a decision has to be made and the italian must have considered a number of factors before making his choice both players expect to be selected for england when fit even if ferdinand remains the better of the two centre halves and both have displayed great leadership qualities that said missing out on the captaincy would be another heavy blow and capello could opt for terry in the knowledge that he would be lifting rather than crushing the spirit of a key player
5593369 it is not hard to see england failing to qualify for 2010 just as in the 1970s when we missed 74 and 78 world cups through a mixture of arrogance bad management awful tactics inferior skill level and an over reliance on the same old faces we are still some way from the dawning of a new era for england englands darkest hours are now at hand and it calls for capello to think radical think revolutionary not to do so will be to fail not just england fans but english football as a whole capello is showing very worrying signs that he not only doesnt know how to do this he isnt even going to try
5593370 rooney is the best england have but what to do with him he clearly loathes being used as a lone forward he has yet to find a partner with whom he works effectively in a pair and it is a complete waste of his ability to use him on the left of a three perhaps it is time to recognise the player belongs in midfield after all if euro 2008 taught us anything it is that a team will best prosper and thrive with a ball playing number ten pulling the midfield strings thats rooney play him in front of gareth barry and owen hargreaves just behind gerrard wide on the right and walcott on the left and gabriel agbonlahor in the middle up front well can you think of a better solution
5593371 amr zaki arrived for next to nothing albeit on loan and showed real class deco was an ingenious delight and palpably 8m well spent johan elmanders price tag means hes less of a bonanza but his goal and all round performance against stoke admittedly went some way to confirming expectations that hell be a significant upgrade on kevin davies and samir nasri more expensive than any of those hinted that he could turn out to have a longer lasting impact than any of them its early days of course and the examples of thierry henry nemanja vidic and gretar steinsson whose goal may have been jammy on saturday but whose performance was highly accomplished prove that newcomers who dont begin promisingly could still come good and of course the reverse is also true bright debuts can raise false hopes just ask ronnie rosenthal serhiy rebrov and regi blinker
5593372 ive never seen the home team at stamford bridge play like this before i was genuinely amazed by the midfield of frank lampard and deco this threatens to be one of the most spectacular partnerships of the season they looked like theyd been playing together for years and chelseas performance was certainly ominous for the rest the fact they played with such style made the result even better i dont know of many players however good who have arrived from overseas and fitted in quite so quickly decos skill has always been obvious but physically he held his own against the portsmouth midfield
5593373 telegraph columnist and former arsenal striker alan smith added i think the booing on saturday was down more to the fact he didnt pass when he should and it was only a small section
5593374 if the fanzines are an accurate representation then it is fair to say ronaldo is being viewed in a much different light and that to some the damage might be irreversible red newss editorial describes the man who scored 42 goals last season as a 23 year old prima donna red issues columnists are more acerbic one branding him a conniving little shit another describing the players pledge to remain as meticulously devised all round face saving pr guff masquerading as an interview its easy to be honest and remorseful after you fail to get away with something not trying it on in the first place is the difficult and praiseworthy bit football fans are notoriously fickle of course and when ronaldo recovers from his ankle injury his first game is pencilled in at blackburn rovers on october 4 his goals will be cheered much the same as usual
5593375 manchester united are due to launch a fresh bid for dimitar berbatov and their first for roque santa cruz this week

5593377 ferguson seemed quite relaxed about the situation even though united have already slipped a couple of points behind their main title rivals with just one match of the season gone
5593378 you want tough views on law and order ask a footballer football is a working class sport and most knife crime affects working class communities stephen lawrence was a pupil at ferdinands school damilola taylor was from the same peckham estate when beckham was 13 the older brother of one of his closest friends was stabbed and paralysed on an otherwise unexceptional day in the east end he was about to sign professional forms with leyton orient more than most politicians these guys have seen knife crime from the sharp end
5593379 ebullient outspoken fiery and proud sensi was one of the last padre padroni owners who are like father figures to their players this attitude worked well in the passionate roman environment especially with captain francesco totti who sensi worked long and hard and paid profusely to keep from succumbing to sirens from other clubs it was sensi who hired fabio capello after his first stint at real madrid under capello and franco baldinis guidance sensi bankrolled the squad that won the 2000 01 scudetto signing players such as emerson gabriel batistuta marcos cafu and jonathan zebina a side which pipped juventus to the title by just two points
5593380 i think what we have given the fans a no fear factor our dream has always been premier league football not just now but when we were trying to get out of league one as well how long is it going to take it could be five years 10 years two years we dont know but what is clear nowadays is that you need to take solid steps in whatever you do so that every day the club grows stronger so that one day when you get there you will be able to compete the fans the players the directors everyone understands how difficult the road will be but so long as we are united we shouldnt fear anything
5593381 this feels like a new year or a new beginning the boss has brought in lots of his own players and others have left you can really see that something is happening you can see that we are already playing as a team im not saying that we are going to win everything but what i am saying is that you can already see that this is a different kind of team we are playing with a lot of pressure high up the pitch and thats always good we get the ball back earlier and that means were regaining possession higher up the pitch not getting drawn back quite so deep that means were getting the ball forward a lot quicker and we are also playing nearer the opposition goal so theres less ground to cover to go and score goals
5593382 its late at night and you need somebody to talk to but who are those people that you once knew and if you called just what would you say would you break down right away youre so alone youre so alone you wanna die and nobody knows

5593516 the red planet is about to be spectacular this month and next earth is catching up with mars in an encounter that will culminate in the closest approach between the two planets in recorded history the next time mars may come this close is in 2287 due to the way jupiters gravity tugs on mars and perturbs its orbit astronomers can only be certain that mars has not come this close to earth in the last 5 000 years but it may be as long as 60 000 years before it happens again the encounter will culminate on august 27th when mars comes to within 34 649 589 miles of earth and will be next to the moon the brightest object in the night sky it will attain a magnitude of 2 9 and will appear 25 11 arc seconds wide at a modest 75 power magnification mars will look as large as the full moon to the naked eye mars will be easy to spot at the beginning of august it will rise in the east at 10p m and reach its azimuth at about 3 a m by the end of august when the two planets are closest mars will rise at nightfall and reach its highest point in the sky at 12 30a m thats pretty convenient to see something that no human being has seen in recorded history so mark your calendar at the beginning of august to see mars grow progressively brighter and brighter throughout the month share this with your children and grandchildren no one alive today will ever see this again

5593568 the auto tune vocal studio offers the most powerful collection of vocal processing tools in existence

5593581 when we looked at the computer power that we all pretty much take for granted these days we realized that by developing a new core processing technology that took advantage of that power we could offer capabilities that we could have only dreamed about back when we first introduced auto tune combined with a host of productivity and workflow enhancements auto tune evo is both the most powerful and easiest to use vocal processing tool weve ever offered
5593582 on the economic level if travel and trade with the us were normalized it would boost the cuban economy
5593583 but then on the other hand the cuban governments number one preoccupation has been to maintain control over the island and that is much easier within the context of the us embargo
5593584 cuba prefers to deal with countries that shares its ideology or at least respects it
5593585 the ideological rationale for close relations with cuba ended with the demise of the soviet union of course and there has been little interest in moscow in reviving the relationship until now
5593586 however moscow is keen to support the idea of a sovereign cuba which does not fall wholly under a us sphere of interest
5593587 cuba has no strategic value to a post soviet russia which is a regional great power but no longer a global superpower and furthermore it runs counter to moscows attempt to play a constructive role in international relations
5593588 cubas attitude is well take your money but that doesnt mean well do what you want
5593589 frankly i dont see russian power projection in the caribbean or in the rest of latin america
5593590 it took me five years to get to the premier league after i left aston villa so it was a great day for me made even better by our first win in the top flight
5593591 this is a different challenge for me at this level and it will be a magnificent achievement if the club can continue to build in the way it has done over the time i have been at hull
5593592 you never know how far we can go but we showed again on saturday the character that has taken us to the top level if we keep that we may well be good enough to stay up
5593593 since i have been at hull a lot has changed a new stadium several managers and now we are in the premier league
5593594 certainly being in the wales squad has helped my development and everything that has happened to me in the last year or so has been a great experience
5593595 maybe when i left villa i could not have envisaged where i am now at villa when i was about 20 i felt i was not good enough to play for the first team and needed to go somewhere else to gain experience and move my career along
5593596 that is what i did it could have gone differently but at hull things have snowballed and we have to keep that going
5593597 now i want to do well for wales again i am 27 now and want to be playing until my late 30s like kevin phillips dion dublin and teddy sheringham
5593598 i have to prove something to john toshack if i do well then i believe i can stay in the squad
5593599 i feel refreshed the move from derby was a great weight off my shoulders
5593600 it is not doom and gloom any more i feel like a new flower it was a massive shock to be left out by wales i had to look a few times at the squad to believe it
5593601 but it made me think about making decisions about my career where i was going and the need to move on i am just happy to be back involved
5593602 my club career needed to be sorted out and then came the axe from wales and i was gutted really shocked
5593603 if i do well for wales it will help me at forest i need to be consistent now for club and country and i have to make it impossible to leave me out
5593604 i should tell you that you were my first love
5593605 i should tell you that you were my first love

5593624 pada tahun 2004 rakyat berasa euphoria sebab terlalu lama berada di bawah pemerintahan seorang perdana menteri pm dan dalam tempoh 22 tahun itu banyak berlaku konflik maka perasaan untuk meraikan perubahan itu wujud di kalangan rakyat dan membuatkan mereka memberi mandat terbesar kepada bn dengan keyakinan untuk menjayakan beberapa perubahan pentadbiran ke arah kebaikan rakyat
5593625 fokus kepada 40 kerusi saya ibaratkan sebagai pendekatan yang merendah diri jika rakyat kata tidak cukup dan ahli kata mesti lebih maka dia rakyat kena tingkatkan gerak kerja pilihan raya sudah tentu pas sendiri akan bertanding lebih daripada 40 kerusi cuma tumpuan diberikan kepada 40 kerusi dalam teori pengurusan tumpuan boleh memberikan kemenangan

5593638 he obviously has a lot to teach hes been out there so long he knows a lot more about the game than i do right now so im definitely going to just try to listen to him pick his brain
5593639 he knows how to pitch and hes been through it he just knows how to set up hitters what pitches to throw when
5593640 hes the type of guy that just makes everybody better around him
5593641 he has so much knowledge and besides the fact that hes still a great pitcher just everything that he knows can help our young team hes a great guy to have on the team no doubt
5593642 when you throw a guy like that into a rotation it just bolsters a team that much more so we just have more firepower now it was cool for me just to be able to face him but now to be a teammate of his obviously to get to play with a couple hall of famers on the same team its cool

5593664 you dont need to have the keenest insight to understand that the humanitarian bridge being erected by the pentagon has little to do with the humanitarian needs of georgia this is the first concrete step taken to support saakashvili steps that were not in evidence in the early days of his invasion of south ossetia its telling that a week after the event washington has only now begun to lash out at the kremlin

5593763 doctor mwanawasa had been making steady progress until last night when his condition suddenly changed and required intervention
5593764 in animals with two sides that were designed by natural selection to be symmetrical subtle departures from symmetry may reflect poor development or exposure to environmental or genetic stress
5593765 in many species these departures are related to poor health lower survival and fewer offspring
5593766 it seems that because bodily asymmetries are too subtle to be seen with the naked eye evolution has instead engineered more conspicuous signals and displays such as broad shoulders curvy waist lines or smooth dance moves to indicate mate quality
5593767 we are sad for him that he has resigned perhaps it would have been better if he had faced impeachment and then stepped down if the public wished that
5593768 it s better that he has resigned otherwise he would have faced impeachment

5593771 the situation is moving in a positive manner the tension is now being cooled down

5593774 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect fire
5593775 according to our reports about 30 taliban tried to attack the salerno base they were fired at we have found six bodies which were all wearing suicide vests
5593776 some of them have blown themselves up others are hiding in nearby houses and corn fields the troops are searching for them
5593777 the issue of judges is likely to be resolved today
5593778 any decision about musharrafs accountability will be taken by the leaders of the coalition parties
5593779 as of december 5 2006 we are no longer actively
5593780 the presidents dialogue forum is not for politicians who just want to get back into parliament for immediate personal gain and who do not care for fijis future
5593781 it is more important for fiji to agree on a better way forward under the peoples charter than just having an election in march 2009

5593812 thats the holy grail by continually monitoring how consumers are using the phone they are able to be super responsive to glitches
5593813 everywhere i go people have told me im getting nervous
5593814 i have to just remind people that it is true that just as john mccain has embraced george bushs policies hes embraced his politics and the same people who brought you george bush are now trying to package john mccain
5593815 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5593816 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5593817 sending a strong signal that the united states is committed to the process of free and fair elections rather than civil war
5593818 an affront to the hemisphere and the democratic traditions we hold important
5593819 the sandinistas unwillingness to negotiate with the democratic opposition its military harassment in the country and now its unilateral breaking of the cease fire confirms president ortegas desire to maintain power at all costs
5593820 we hope the government of nicaragua will reconsider this regrettable decision which raises serious questions about its commitment to the process of elections
5593821 we still have a long way to go but they the democrats have done a lot of things
5593822 it may just be possible to strike a deal in the next couple of weeks
5593823 the united states will have to depend on foreign rockets and spacecraft to send americans to orbit
5593824 as president ill make our space program a priority again by devoting the attention and resources needed to not only inspire the world with feats of exploration but also improve life here on earth
5593825 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5593826 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of senator obama let me say just in case senator obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting nasa funding i oppose such cuts
5593827 i will ensure that space exploration remains a top priority and that the u s continues to lead the world in this field
5593828 primary advisor to the secretary and the department on energy and technology policy development
5593829 expected to offer opinions and participate in policy debates thats the way the process works
5593830 he always struck me as being naturally and philosophically opposed to regulation at the outset and it took an enormous amount of discussion and analysis to convince him otherwise
5593831 i cant think of a case where chase advocated more environmental or health protections
5593832 well see if they can turn their attention to governance and get a handle on their problems
5593833 they have been using the musharraf thing as an excuse for non governance
5593834 this is really the moment of truth for pakistan if this fails it is unclear what will happen
5593835 it will take the new government a full year to work things out on counterterrorism a year to make the mistakes they have to make it is a huge experiment
5593836 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing
5593837 pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5593838 were confident that we will maintain a good relationship with the government of pakistan
5593839 had a good meeting with the prime minister a couple of weeks ago in washington the pakistanis realize that the threat of terrorism the threat of extremism is a threat to them as well as the rest of the world
5593840 he hasnt effectively been leading pakistan for the last six months
5593841 youre truly not going to see any great changes in pakistan with musharrafs resignation with the exception you will start to see greater political infighting among the coalition partners
5593842 you could count on him to make tough decisions even though you could never count on him to completely follow through
5593843 it will probably be much harder to get decisive action as we did with musharraf the good news is that the democracy process is moving forward and it may be possible to create a more durable political framework

5593932 we found that if a teacher has a high achieving group of students pushing them harder by giving them more homework could be beneficial
5593933 similarly if a teacher has a low ability class assigning more homework may help since they may not have been pushed hard enough
5593934 given these students abilities and time constraints learning by doing may be a more effective tool for improvement
5593935 there has been an extensive amount of research examining the influences of students achievement but it has been primarily focused on financial inputs such as class size or teachers credentials
5593936 our study examined the affect that additional homework has on test scores
5593937 this does not mean that homework is unimportant for average achievers

5593988 peter has made a wonderful contribution in both the financial and strategic directions of qantas over the past eight years and has served the company and shareholders with distinction mr dixon said

5593991 whoever did it has climbed over the back fence and got in through the back door
5593992 we have fought our way through this centres project from raising the money to lay the foundations to continue to raise money to pay for the finishing touches and this makes it a sad knock back
5593993 police seem to think the break in was for either money or drugs but we do not have anything like that on the premises
5593994 this is so so sad we have a beautiful centre here and hundreds of kind hearted people have made it happen those involved with the centre and those who use it are heartbroken and cancer sufferers will be asking how could anyone do this to us
5593995 the situation was controlled late on sunday night but re erupted on monday morning with heavy stone pelting in rangila pol and nagori wad
5593996 in all around fifteen vehicles were torched and seven people were injured who were later shifted to the vs hospital we are searching for the reason that triggered second round violence on monday
5593997 while i was returning from a dinner with friends in my car at around 11 30 i saw mobs near dilli darwaza the mob even tried to stop my car twice but i escaped there were two groups that were pelting stones at each other a few stones even hit my car and then a tubelight smashed on the wind shield
5593998 it was a tough task for us to handle the situation as the area affected was huge we had to call upon the nearby police stations to control the situation however the riots continued till 3 30 am on monday after that we patrolled the area and detained some of the youth no arrests have been made in the case as on monday afternoon
5593999 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge

5594008 the members of pink floyd were just people i knew roger waters for example was a boy who lived around the corner and dave gilmour went to school over the road
5594009 in the years after he came back to cambridge he could still sometimes be very amusing with me but he could also be very shy and reclusive because hed withdrawn
5594010 after returning to cambridge he showed no interest in pink floyd and just tried to put that whole thing away

5594026 if the deaths had been caused by any other form of violence there would be a national outcry and rightly so for make no mistake deaths on the road are violent
5594027 ask any of my officers who have to attend the scenes of collisions or any of the other emergency service workers who deal with the aftermath
5594028 and yet in a strange fashion the carnage is accepted almost as a price we have to pay for being able to travel by car it neednt be like that for a start it is easy to seek to blame any cause other than driver behaviour
5594029 roads are dangerous we hear from the commentators and pundits
5594030 in a small number of cases there is merit in those arguments too many of our roads were constructed long before the advent of mass motoring and no one in this county needs reminding how congested they can become
5594031 but in the final analysis its almost always the actions of drivers which cause collisions speed recklessness carelessness driving without a thought for road conditions or other road users the list is endless
5594032 if only there was a magic answer to stop it but there isnt thats why we have campaigns against speeding and drinking and driving
5594033 tens of thousands of pounds are invested in safety devices yet the collisions keep on happening and families keep being torn apart by the tragic news of death or crippling injury at the same time bizarrely as the anti safety camera lobby keep complaining about speeding motorists being taxed
5594034 i would hope theyd heed the signs of success on the a14 between cambridge and huntingdon where the average speed cameras have cut the number of serious and fatal collisions by more than 80 per cent

5594037 a new visual search engine could help photographers keep track of their photographs whenever and wherever they appear on the internet the tineye search engine developed by canadian company idee allows users to search by uploading a picture rather than typing in a keyword it then conducts a pixel by pixel search across the internet flagging up all instances of that image even if its been cropped merged or digitally altered in some way

5594045 we have a very affordable season ticket package but we want to ensure our most loyal fans that the woes of the economy does not interfere with their opportunity to enjoy their racing first hand
5594046 with the debit card the cost of season tickets will actually be less in 2009 if you pay early if you cant we will work with each and every fan that may need a layaway program of some sort to secure their season tickets

5594216 it took them this long to figure out that sanchez and five other schools need to be inspected and they only realized that a week before school started that they arent ready to open
5594217 these problems have been going on for years why did it take them this long to figure this out
5594218 i could see the water come down and my teacher would use buckets and trash cans and she would always complain and say by next year when the new school opens i am going to transfer there and for that entire year she was complaining but they would never fix it

5594251 and i want to prove that i can be the starting point guard on a championship team
5594252 if you have five guys on the court who are all about themselves its not going to be very successful as we have seen in the past and thats the job of the point guard at least the way i was taught growing up get the scorers the ball at the right spots and the right time stop the other guy on defense and spot up and hit some shots it has worked for me so i dont know why i would ever change it
5594253 what i do works for me and im happy with what i have
5594254 if i can dribble with my eyes closed then i can see my teammates better
5594255 i think it wont be much of a decision i think with him at that number 4 0 million and with us having a successful season it wont be that difficult of a decision
5594256 he has to be a starting point guard on a team that can get to 46 48 50 wins and be consistent night in and night out
5594257 thats what starting point guards do that doesnt mean being consistent with his shot or anything else it means playing winning basketball and identifying that brandon is hot or lamarcus is hot and being that quarterback of the team

5594274 consumenten zijn vandaag bang voor een verdere stijging van de rente en kiezen daarom voor een woonkrediet met vaste rente financi le instellingen spelen in op de angst van hun klanten en wijzen hen op het risico dat de rente kan stijgen tot boven de 8 procent uiteraard moet een krediet te allen tijde terugbetaald worden maar het is boerenbedrog om te spreken over een rente van 8 procent
5594275 de hoogste rente die de voorbije tien jaar werd vastgesteld bedraagt 5 7 procent met vaste renteformule van 5 33 procent zit je daar dicht bij
5594276 de stijging van de grondstoffen en de inflatie zijn over hun hoogtepunt heen als de economie verder gaat slabakken zal de ecb de rente laten zakken en worden woonkredieten met jaarlijks aanpasbare rente ook goedkoper

5594281 you have to like that and you have to like a company that has executed so well
5594282 itll be one of the slowest days of the year and i think it just kind of fed into itself
5594283 some of these things become self fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile
5594284 a 9 percent wage increase is pretty good obviously the union had some leverage in that qwest didnt want to have a strike with the dnc coming into town
5594285 we didnt get everything we wanted but we achieved the best settlement possible in light of qwests struggle to regain its financial health
5594286 i appreciate the collaborative effort the bargaining teams made in confronting key issues facing employees and qwest especially health care
5594287 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here to adapt

5594291 theyre heavily concentrated in states where home prices are plummeting
5594292 could go down the street and get that loan somewhere else
5594293 all of us in new york hollywood and across the country should be concerned about how this failure to reach an agreement is impacting our members we have already suffered significantly as a result of the wga strike and now we are experiencing an additional loss of work made worse when we can find a job by having to work without a contract under old terms and conditions there are some who feel we have all the time in the world to make this deal we on the n y board do not
5594294 this is not in the best interest of new york division sag members or any sag members across the country it could tend to delay and prolong the negotiations by emboldening management with a false belief that sag actors are split on the issues the plainly political nature of this action is cynical and unfortunate

5594303 but the rate at which tenants are seeking property is being outstripped by the number of rental properties coming on to the market leading some to speculate that rents which have been rising may flatten out
5594304 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5594305 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5594306 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5594307 do these two sets have the same number of objects

5594315 if australia were to follow the racps recommendation to include adhd as a disability category eligible for additional support funding special education budgets for all australian educational jurisdictions would skyrocket
5594316 schools and educational systems will not be able to cope with the demand and as such each additional supported child will receive less
5594317 in the end children with significant disabilities cerebral palsy autism intellectual impairment will not receive the support they require and the segregation of students with high support needs will continue to increase
5594318 more educationally and fiscally responsible approach would be to provide targeted funding for which individual schools and teachers could apply to support their access to professional development in the area of inclusive educational practice

5594328 it was not an absolutely decisive factor whether georgians were trained by americans or not
5594329 what happened was due to the political decision of georgian authorities and not the performance on the ground

5594333 it is a wise and prudent move the market is going through a period of uncertainty now but the chances of the market picking up in the next four years is quite high
5594334 they certainly have the capacity to wait it out and the four years gives them theoption of working out the best possible strategy

5594338 my previous research suggested that bodily symmetry is not necessarily what people attend to when they find someone attractive but nonetheless the physical cues that they do prefer may reveal an individuals underlying developmental quality i e degree of symmetry this new research identifies an explanation for the correlation between bodily shape and attractiveness your body proportions shape and stature are signals that conspicuously advertise your good development or health and therefore the degree to which you are a desirable reproductive partner in many species fewer departures from perfect symmetry are associated with good development health and reproductive success

5594365 bene ecco led disse padre tempo vieni a sederti vicino a me e che nel frattempo gli si porti da bere
5594366 led sono io che ho chiesto di vederci qui perch non sono affatto contento di come vanno le cose mi sembra ingiusto che tutti i mesi abbiano feste ricorrenze e bel tempo mentre io non ho nulla
5594367 s vero nulla prendi ottobre per esempio lui il mese del vino e sai quanto gli uomini amino il vino e poi ha pure la soddisfazione di chiudere alla grande con la festa di halloween e non parliamo di dicembre le feste natalizie il capodanno la settimana bianca oppure giugno luglio agosto in cui sboccia lestate tanto desiderata da tutti senza contare che poi nel loro periodo il tempo stupendo e che mi dici di aprile che con la sua primavera fa sbocciare bellissimi fiori e germogliare i semi delle altre piante in pi io rappresento la fine delle vacanze e linizio della scuola e inoltre con la mia venuta finisce il bel tempo e comincia la stagione pi deprimente di tutte lautunno tutti hanno qualcosa tutti sono ammirati tranne me voglio anche io un motivo per essere amato dagli uomini

5594382 we found that if a teacher has a high achieving group of students pushing them harder by giving them more homework could be beneficial
5594383 similarly if a teacher has a low ability class assigning more homework may help since they may not have been pushed hard enough
5594384 given these students abilities and time constraints learning by doing may be a more effective tool for improvement
5594385 there has been an extensive amount of research examining the influences of students achievement but it has been primarily focused on financial inputs such as class size or teachers credentials
5594386 our study examined the affect that additional homework has on test scores
5594387 this does not mean that homework is unimportant for average achievers
5594388 but it does mean that this population may also benefit from other activities such as sports art or music rather than additional hours of math homework
5594389 we plan to do something different than is usual at conferences we aim to present insights and understanding of the complexities of one of the most important oil and gas markets in the world the insights will be provided by major industry players and experts who will share their views with the audience on the key issues facing the industry in india the conference is expected to attract large national and international participation and will be an ideal opportunity to network and expand commercial interests
5594390 previous research has suggested that its not individual hiv viruses that get into the brain but rather hiv infected immune cells known as monocytes
5594391 using an animal model we wanted to find out first of all whether being infected with hiv enables monocytes to do what they dont usually do escape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue
5594392 these results demonstrated very clearly that being infected with hiv somehow gives monocytes the capacity to cross an intact blood brain barrier bbb but we also suspected that something else was making it easier for hiv infected monocytes to breach the defences protecting the brain from infection
5594393 so we hypothesized that the combination of hiv infected monocytes and elevated lps levels would amplify the ability of hiv to cross the bbb and get into the brain
5594394 clearly hiv infected monocytes uniquely benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people so when hiv infected monocytes are knocking on the door of the bbb and starting to crack it open the lps facilitates their entry by making the bbb more permeable apparently by weakening blood vessel structure
5594395 these results demonstrate very dramatically that hiv infection of cells associated with the bbb in conjunction with lps exposure contributes to bbb breakdown so when hiv infection occurs we seem to have a 1 2 3 combination of punches working in concert to facilitate entry of hiv infected monocytes into the bbb protected brain hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
5594396 we may be able to use antibiotics that kill intestinal bacteria that make lps and drugs are already available that can bind to lps and clear it from the bloodstream ideally we would promptly start newly diagnosed hiv infected patients on a treatment to reinforce their bbbs so that hiv cant penetrate it and perhaps we could even strengthen the bbbs of people whove been infected for quite a while but before we can prevent the tragedy of hiv associated dementia we need to better understand the mechanism by which these molecular and cellular punches interact to undermine the bbb

5594403 according to businessweek the solution to the iphone 3gs chipset issues could be easier than most of us probably expected apparently apple set up the infineon chip to demand more of a 3g signal than was necessary which resulted in a switch back to the slower network if there are too many people in the area using an iphone at the same time this involves an issue with software on the chip which can probably be remedied through an upgrade instead of a costly and annoying recall businessweek claims that apple and chip maker infineon are hard at work on the fix and it could be released as early as the end of this month businessweek via cnet
5594404 here is the bug here is the fix update the driver
5594405 im glad i kept my original iphone and didnt upgrade to 3g

5594436 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
5594437 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
5594438 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
5594439 we are not staying home with our children by default
5594440 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
5594441 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening

5594460 the government is committed to combating corruption however large or sensitive in keeping with instructions from the political leadership
5594461 this will be an example to those who break the law and proves that no one is above the law neither the police nor the public
5594462 fighting corruption is a global challenge and a never ending effort for all countries and the uae for its part is committed to maintaining the highest international standards to fight graft
5594463 fighting corruption is deeply enshrined in our religion and traditions and simply means that the right thing is done transparency must be upheld to assure that the right thing is done and accountability if it is not done on condition that no injustice is done to anybody
5594464 cases of corruption that emerged in the recent past and the firmness with which the government has dealt with them confirm that no one has immunity and the law is above all

5594467 we commit to further strengthening our collaboration with the bsa and its members in combating this social and economic threat
5594468 we thank the uae ministry of economy for supporting the bsa and its members in their efforts this latest initiative reflects the uae governments strong stance against intellectual property rights violations particularly against the software trade which is an integral part of the fast growing middle eastern it sector
5594469 in collaboration with concerned governmental institutions such as the ministry we hope to prevent software piracy from ruining the significant gains of the uae in this field

5594473 the large increase in the uaes income over the past few years has allowed it to build up its overseas assets massively and this in turn has enabled it to easily finance any budget deficit without resorting to withdrawing from its deposits with the uae banks
5594474 in previous years the uae had resorted to both overseas assets and bank deposits to shore up the shortfall this explains the rapid growth in government deposits with local banks as all the deficit has been financed through return from those assets since 2000 in 2005 2006 and probably 2007 the budget recorded massive surpluses and this sharply boosted those deposits

5594509 someone made the comment to me the other day that if you took billy slater greg inglis and michael crocker out of the storm side it would make a big difference
5594510 brisbane need to keep all their key players on the field and build towards the finals
5594511 i still think at full strength and playing their best they are one of the few sides capable of testing melbourne
5594512 at times they go one out too much but they have hodgo and karmichael back and those guys can score great tries
5594513 ive been working really hard on my defence at training and playing against mark gasnier last week hes big and strong and fast
5594514 but i really enjoy it playing with all the boys and the more i play the more confident i get
5594515 it will help if we can keep the same team each week and having those guys hodges hunt and carroll back is certainly going to help us
5594516 we havent had that consistency for the last five or six weeks
5594517 prince is a quality player and while we havent spoken about it im sure therell be some traffic heading his way
5594518 since my first time in iraq in 2005 one essential fact on the ground has completely changed
5594519 while coalition troops are still the most powerful fighting force in the country the coalition is no longer in control the iraqi government is now exercising its sovereignty and does not wish to be dictated to
5594520 you will only be able to perform your role as an adviser if you accept this fact and work with it you are there to offer help not to dictate
5594521 coalition force members are not popular in iraq they see us as responsible for destroying their country even if they are glad to have been liberated from saddam
5594522 this may not be fair but in their eyes it is true similar opinions about the foreign invaders are also found in afghanistan
5594523 we are working in war zones peoples lives are often difficult in such circumstances humans turn to humour learn to laugh particularly at difficult situations
5594524 the russian side is gravely violating the conditions provided for by the peace accord signed by the presidents of georgia france and the russian federation
5594525 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5594526 nobody is planning to withdraw the russian contingent very swiftly as there is no such necessity
5594527 im not sure theres a whole lot that could happen to me as far as winning and losing or being benched starting or not starting that i havent been through already
5594528 he has a much better knowledge of the offense than the other two youngsters because hes been in it
5594529 its amazing that hes been able to accomplish what he has thus far given all the things weve asked of him
5594530 i feel like ive got certain talents and i use them to the best of my ability
5594531 ill agree the drink isnt cheap ill agree everyone should eat more fruits and berries you will agree that most north americans dont even come close to the recommended daily allowance
5594532 he told me that it would be great if i decide to go to baylor but that i needed to make the best decision i could for myself and that he was proud of me wherever i go
5594533 i want to take some visits and learn more about the schools
5594534 when i am positive about my decision i will announce it
5594535 he could still be on the streets of miami either hurting somebody or having somebody hurt him
5594536 instead hes going back to school this fall to finish his degree and hes got an olympic medal
5594537 i made so many mistakes because i wanted to win so bad
5594538 i realized track could get me out of the streets of miami
5594539 the people at st augustines college its a small place but i want to show them that no matter what school you come from the sky is the limit you can do anything you put your mind to
5594540 it sneaked up on me i wish i had been more of a leader gotten more of the younger players to work out with me and get ready for the season
5594541 i started thinking about this my freshman year when we lost to reidsville in the playoffs
5594542 weve worked hard right now we just looking at the first game against garner weve got to look at it one game at a time
5594543 i wish you could concentrate on sportsmanship for a year put it in a jar and place it on a shelf and think you had taken care of it
5594544 the most wonderful part of it is not the almost superhuman achievements but the spirit in which it is done take away that spirit and it is done
5594545 it gives you a chance to succeed if you focus on the little things and the details
5594546 they had won four games in the six years before i got there
5594547 every minute is accounted for every second one thing we never do is waste time
5594548 i rely on them heavily to teach the fundamentals to the players
5594549 as a coach i look at this roster we have landon donovan and david beckham as a starting point thats fabulous
5594550 i think we have a good group of players to join in and make this a good team
5594551 hes definitely one of the greatest athletes ive ever seen in my life
5594552 its humbling for me and for kobe bryant it was unbelievable especially for myself
5594553 going against greece and spain those were easy to get up for this game it might have been easy to come out and have a game where afterwards we make excuses but we didnt take a step back and it felt good
5594554 i dont think we can intimidate opponents but we can take care of business
5594555 its the way im playing and the way im approaching this whole tournament were going out there playing with a chip on our shoulders playing angry
5594556 were a good team getting back to square one but its still getting back to square one for the medal round
5594557 were looking forward to it were going to have to get a lot of rest and take care of our bodies one thing well try to do is get up and down and wear them down a lot
5594558 its nothing i can control and honestly i can say it has been very fair to me and i got the biggest gold medal of them all
5594559 im a little sad but at the same time its great to have four olympic medals
5594560 if the doctors say he can go he says he can go and manager davey johnson says he can go he can go
5594561 time will tell but hes not a guy you write off
5594562 i had bike issues somewhere in the middle of the bike leg i gave everything i had
5594563 that time when the hunts tried to corner the silver market
5594564 then i found out it was brazil and i was cheering in the doping control room
5594565 i think its going to be a battle we both know each others styles quite well but i think that were prepared and we have such a strong unit i dont think theres any break in us
5594566 we havent lost that feeling of what it felt like last year in the semifinals were going to carry that with us we want this gold
5594567 the information we have is very scant and comes from employees at the store who reported seeing the children in the vicinity of the dumpster in the past two weeks
5594568 it appears they may have been sleeping in the dumpster
5594569 according to store employees the children are two boys aged about four and six years old and a girl aged about nine years
5594570 we are trying to do the best thing for them and we dont want them to think they are in trouble but we have to treat it as serious
5594571 we are hoping that they are most likely from a home nearby but we dont know what their home situation is like and therefore have to speak to their parents
5594572 the child jumped up and both of them were shocked
5594573 they have cleaned the bin and placed a mattress in it
5594574 banks are already borrowing short term money at 11 plus and september has traditionally been tight for liquidity with advance tax outflows and people borrowing to fund their balance sheets at the end of the second quarter of 2008 09

5594576 three years down the road the prospects for the cpa are uncertain but not necessarily bleak
5594577 ultimate success however will require the parties to realize that peace can only be consolidated through the full implementation of the abyei road map
5594578 a successful implementation of the cpa brightens the prospects for peace in darfur

5594584 as to your real question the idea of immediate compilation and
5594585 they are young cute amp fresh and they enjoy a tight twink ass
5594586 this is being preserved for the enjoyment of visitors and locals alike now and for generations to come
5594587 with cattana wetlands home to some of the few remaining stands of feather palm its important that we strike a balance between enjoyment and preservation
5594588 the bligh government wants to ensure that we are planning so that into the future we have the facilities needed to enjoy such a place of beauty but also to minimise their impact on the environment
5594589 the tread lightly development project helps ensure that the cattana wetlands habitat is preserved locations such as these are becoming increasingly popular with visitors
5594590 im delighted we are working together with council on this very worthy q150 project
5594591 this is a significant project for the northern beaches and creates passive recreational open space in a sensitive environment known for its abundance of unique flora and fauna
5594592 once completed this will become a showcase for the region and will be progressed in stages providing boardwalks lakes and enhancing the existing foliage in an area so close to the heart of smithfield township

5594594 previous research has suggested that its not individual hiv viruses that get into the brain but rather hiv infected immune cells known as monocytes
5594595 using an animal model we wanted to find out first of all whether being infected with hiv enables monocytes to do what they dont usually do escape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue
5594596 these results demonstrated very clearly that being infected with hiv somehow gives monocytes the capacity to cross an intact blood brain barrier bbb but we also suspected that something else was making it easier for hiv infected monocytes to breach the defences protecting the brain from infection
5594597 so we hypothesized that the combination of hiv infected monocytes and elevated lps levels would amplify the ability of hiv to cross the bbb and get into the brain
5594598 clearly hiv infected monocytes uniquely benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people so when hiv infected monocytes are knocking on the door of the bbb and starting to crack it open the lps facilitates their entry by making the bbb more permeable apparently by weakening blood vessel structure
5594599 these results demonstrate very dramatically that hiv infection of cells associated with the bbb in conjunction with lps exposure contributes to bbb breakdown so when hiv infection occurs we seem to have a 1 2 3 combination of punches working in concert to facilitate entry of hiv infected monocytes into the bbb protected brain hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
5594600 we may be able to use antibiotics that kill intestinal bacteria that make lps and drugs are already available that can bind to lps and clear it from the bloodstream ideally we would promptly start newly diagnosed hiv infected patients on a treatment to reinforce their bbbs so that hiv cant penetrate it and perhaps we could even strengthen the bbbs of people whove been infected for quite a while but before we can prevent the tragedy of hiv associated dementia we need to better understand the mechanism by which these molecular and cellular punches interact to undermine the bbb
5594601 i was thinking about how denver could use the convention spotlight to share news about the citys vibrant art scene

5594606 i think in the downtown area it will likely not be a normal commute because of additional traffic
5594607 so people should plan ahead and add extra time to their commute
5594608 lincoln and broadway are going to be your best friends in terms of getting around on the east side of downtown
5594609 i hate to say this but for most people the convention is not an immediate part of their lives so just take the freeway go out east and get around it

5594612 on the left side one starts getting many diseases like schizophrenia in the upper level of this group this side these same seven centers act to give you very serious troubles one of them is that people become schizophrenic it can be cured it can be cured if you can move that person to the center and by kundalini awakening you can do it
5594613 now you see the disease of schizophrenia also can come from mooladhara problem
5594614 all your incurable diseases right from all muscular troubles like mellitus and all that all your incurable diseases right from cancer onwards all your psychosomatic problems right from schizophrenia and everything come because of the disturbance in mooladhara when the roots are not all right how can you cure the tree if the roots are all right then any medicine can reach any center any area any place any fruit but if the roots are not all right how can you work it out
5594615 apart from that ie diseases of the physical side we have the mental troubles with people like a left sided person will have a mental problem like he will be a sly person he will be a frightened person he would not be talking to others he would be nervous he would not have self confidence he will be running away from public and also then he becomes schizophrenic that he hibernates sort of thing in the house becomes like a cabbage that kind of a lunatic he becomes
5594616 americans have got into problems of very serious nature of very horrible diseases which i have predicted two of them one which comes from aids and another one where a brain goes off a person becomes mad at a very young age
5594617 although conflict has many aspects one that warfighters and policy makers often talk about is the motivation to fight which undoubtedly has its origins in the brain and is reflected in peripheral neurophysiological processes
5594618 so one question would be how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight other questions raised by controlling the mind how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands as cognitive neuroscience and related technologies become more pervasive using technology for nefarious purposes becomes easier

5594627 in england the speaker of the house is not allowed to speak
5594628 i take the resignation of pervez musharraf as president of pakistan in true spirit adding it must be taken positively for the sake of national interests
5594629 musharraf has always been unpredictable and that is what made me think that he might not resign
5594630 i am still confused whether this is a step towards stability or more instability
5594631 appointments just to make everyone in the coalition happy is a dangerous trend
5594632 it will be a great disappointment if they again fail to deliver
5594633 we expect our leaders to take solid steps to check inflation

5594637 choice of presidential candidate has become a test case for the ruling coalition after musharrafs exit
5594638 we remained steadfast with president musharraf until he resigned from his office while similarly we cooperated with the nawaz sharif and his family as his children and family members stayed in our homes but he went to saudi arabia by making an agreement of 10 years exile
5594639 we would further strengthen the party since the political parties always gain momentum by sitting on the opposition benches

5594648 this nuclear energy is vital following the increase in the world fuel price and our limited oil reserve moreover nuclear energy is cheap and clean
5594649 but in terms of discussions today there is no doubt there are significant moves where our governments are moving in a similar direction
5594650 i dont deny we have a long path to walk but i am also very confident we are walking that path together
5594651 theyve both come up really well positive outlooks for both people
5594652 archie was obviously a bit down when he got back but the medical guys examined him yesterday and signs are really good hes progressing well he progressed well in the last 24 hours
5594653 so he looks like hes a really good chance to play against newcastle and nick wards the same
5594654 i think brebners got a real good chance of being involved this week
5594655 hes probably unlikely to start but theres a good chance that brebner will get on the pitch at some stage
5594656 in 10 or 12 years ive never faced anything like this
5594657 there were times when i thought was it worth it because it was hard thankfully now im towards the other side of it
5594658 theres no getting away from it its going to be hard
5594659 someone made the comment to me the other day that if you took billy slater greg inglis and michael crocker out of the storm side it would make a big difference

5594670 since my first time in iraq in 2005 one essential fact on the ground has completely changed
5594671 while coalition troops are still the most powerful fighting force in the country the coalition is no longer in control the iraqi government is now exercising its sovereignty and does not wish to be dictated to
5594672 you will only be able to perform your role as an adviser if you accept this fact and work with it you are there to offer help not to dictate
5594673 coalition force members are not popular in iraq they see us as responsible for destroying their country even if they are glad to have been liberated from saddam
5594674 this may not be fair but in their eyes it is true similar opinions about the foreign invaders are also found in afghanistan
5594675 having had a spitritual awakening as a result of these steps we tried to carry this message to alcholics and to practice these prinicples in all of our affairs
5594676 our stories discclose in a general way what we used to be like what happened and what we are like now
5594677 dealing with all or the overall universall aspects of the subject under consideration esp without attempting to consider or deal with details or specific aspects
5594678 he ferreira said political parties will never support the naxal organisations abvp has given them funds for their activities bal thackeray and his party shiv sena members had given them funds for their activities in mumbai
5594679 look hes my brother and i need to find him now
5594680 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5594681 it an alleged threat and it is not true the government of sudan is a serious government and it is totally committed to its obligations especially when it comes to agreement signed with other organizations and especially the united nations and the african union im not aware of any threat that has been towards to the united nations regarding their very existence in the sudan if the icc has and the judges have confirmed the indictment of the president
5594682 i would rather say that the government is totally committed to its obligations and we have never threatened the united nations peacekeeping force here in sudan whether in darfur or in the south
5594683 in fact they usually do that not only in sudan but everywhere just in case because it happens that when the icc announced its indictment of the president of sudan some of the un peacekeepers here have been relocated outside of the sudan in case anything might happen and this proves just a precautionary measure and because nothing happened and things are going normal in sudan and now those are taken away from sudan the peacekeepers have been flown back to sudan
5594684 if a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it but its a very slim chance
5594685 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5594686 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5594687 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5594688 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5594689 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5594690 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5594691 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5594692 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water

5594697 im on unpaid leave but its worth it there are so many people who have no chance to watch the games
5594698 but its all about the atmosphere i just wanted to bring them here and surely they know about liu xiang and the hurdles
5594699 not bad i feel really terrible about liu xiang though
5594700 we are very close to deciding to send the prime minister for the closing ceremony of the olympics to be participated by many foreign dignitaries
5594701 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5594702 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5594703 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5594704 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5594705 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case

5594742 de godsspraak over babel die jesaja de zoon van amoz aanschouwd heeft
5594743 hoor een gedaver op de bergen als van veel volk hoor een rumoer der koninkrijken van verzamelde volken de h ere der heerscharen monstert een krijgsheer
5594744 zie de dag des h eren komt meedogenloos met verbolgenheid en brandende toorn om de aarde tot een woestenij te maken en haar zondaars van haar te verdelgen
5594745 dan zal ik aan de wereld het kwaad bezoeken en aan de goddelozen hun ongerechtigheid en ik zal de trots der overmoedigen doen ophouden en de hoogmoed der geweldenaars vernederen
5594746 daarom zal ik de hemel doen wankelen en de aarde zal bevend van haar plaats wijken door de verbolgenheid van de h ere der heerscharen ten dage van zijn brandende toorn en het zal geschieden dat zij als een opgejaagde gazel en als schapen die niemand bijeen houdt zich zullen wenden ieder naar zijn eigen volk en zullen vluchten een ieder naar zijn eigen land
5594747 en babel het sieraad der koninkrijken de trotse luister der chaldee n zal worden als sodom en gomorra toen god ze onderstboven keerde het zal in eeuwigheid niet meer bewoond worden noch bevolkt zijn van geslacht tot geslacht
5594748 want de h ere zal zich over jakob ontfermen en nog zal hij isra l verkiezen en ze op hun eigen bodem doen wonen dan zal de vreemdeling zich bij hen aansluiten en men zal zich voegen bij het huis van jakob en de volken zullen het met zich nemen en het naar zijn eigen plaats brengen en het huis isra ls zal ze als erfelijk bezit verkrijgen op de grond des h eren tot slaven en tot slavinnen zo zullen zij degenen die hen gevangen namen gevangen nemen en heersen over hun drijvers
5594749 en een sterke engel nam een steen op als een grote molensteen en wierp hem in de zee zeggende z zal babylon met geweld geworpen worden de grote stad en zij zal nooit meer gevonden worden

5594751 een toenemend aantal evangelische christenen gelooft volgens een christelijk spreker en voorganger niet langer dat ongelovigen voor eeuwig verloren gaan ook hij zelf denkt dat uiteindelijk iedereen wordt gered
5594752 de spreker wees er in een tent vol jongeren op dat er in de bijbel teksten voorkomen die suggereren dat ongelovigen voor eeuwig verloren gaan maar ook passages die erop wijzen dat het uiteindelijk met iedereen goed komt spreekt de bijbel zichzelf dan tegen nee dat geloof ik niet aldus de voorganger de bijbel wordt echter wel vaak verkeerd uitgelegd vindt hij zo komen er volgens hem in de grondtekst verschillende woorden voor die in het nederlands met eeuwig worden vertaald maar die in feite slaan op een periode die wel een einde kent eeuwig oordeel betekent dus niet voor altijd maar heeft een tijdelijk karakter ook staat er in de bijbel dat het gods wil is dat alle mensen worden gered zouden er dan toch mensen verloren gaan vroeg de spreker zich af als god zijn eigen wil niet kan waarmaken is hij in feite een zondaar zonde betekent namelijk je doel missen zijn einddoel is dat alle mensen uiteindelijk zullen zeggen here jezus u bent mijn heer dat jezus zegt de weg de waarheid en het leven te zijn ondersteunt de referent alleen maar in zijn opvattingen alle andere wegen lopen uiteindelijk dood aan het eind der tijden zal blijken dat gods genade zo groot is dat iedereen gered zal zijn de hel ziet hij als een plaats van loutering waar ongelovigen worden ontdaan van hun ongeloof en waar zij zuiver uit tevoorschijn komen geloven heeft dus wel zin volgens hem
5594753 halleluja het heil en de heerlijkheid en de macht zijn van onze god want waarachtig en rechtvaardig zijn zijn oordelen want hij heeft de grote hoer geoordeeld die de aarde met haar hoererij verdierf en hij heeft het bloed zijner knechten van haar hand ge ist
5594754 halleluja want de here onze god de almachtige heeft het koningschap aanvaard laten wij blijde zijn en vreugde bedrijven en hem de eer geven want de bruiloft des lams is gekomen en zijn vrouw heeft zich gereedgemaakt en haar is gegeven zich met blinkend en smetteloos fijn linnen te kleden want dit fijne linnen zijn de rechtvaardige daden der heiligen

5594927 apabila dia masih kecil dan belum baligh maka tidak diharuskan puasa akan tetapi jika dia mampu dan tidak merasa berat maka dia diperintahkan untuk berpuasa dahulu para shahabat menyuruh anak anak mereka berpuasa sampai sampai jika ada di antara anak anak itu menangis mereka memberikan mainan untuk membuat mereka lupa namun jika memang hal ini benar benar membahayakan maka orang tua boleh melarangnya karena allah subhanahu wa taala melarang kita memberikan harta milik anak anak kepada mereka karena khawatir akan rusaknya harta tersebut maka tentunya kekhawatiran akan bahaya yang menimpa badan lebih utama untuk dicegah akan tetapi larangan tersebut bukan dengan cara yang keras karena hal ini tidaklah layak dilakukan terhadap anak anak pada saat mendidik mereka

5594945 i am so happy and grateful now that i am taking continuous personal action to promote wealth throughout the world each day i commit to performing five actions towards my goal of creating a wealthy and abundant life
5594946 i found that if i set a goal even if i dont know how im going to accomplish it the setting of the goal raises my awareness to notice ideas people and situations that help me to achieve it bob always says that if you know how youre going to achieve a goal than its not big enough as i become a stronger leader and act based on what i want i always attract the people i need to achieve my goals
5594947 i was looking for a mentor and someone to emulate
5594948 taking continuous and persistent personal action is what bob helped me to do and gave me an example of
5594949 we believe the way to end poverty is to teach people how to earn money i know when i went to college i expected to learn how to earn money there but they dont teach how to earn money in college
5594950 i really think that bob is emulating his mentors in doing this program

5594966 i havent changed a real lot maybe i just had easier shots thats all it was theyve just been closer to the posts
5594967 if you can strike while the iron is hot if you can take advantage of field position and pressure and momentum then the game does have a fair amount of chemistry to it
5594968 no not psychological i dont think it is at all
5594969 i think the tri nations shows how tough it is to win away from home obviously south africa did it in new zealand which was a huge effort
5594970 its just the way this competition is your home games are the ones that you really want to win and you really have to win
5594971 its not something that weve spoken about too much i suppose the history its more just this year
5594972 weve been given our opportunities now weve got two games over here so wed like to win both of them
5594973 whether the springboks won or lost wed still go into the game with a bit of confidence

5595003 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people
5595004 i think that there should be no mercy for that we will do our best not to let this crime go unpunished
5595005 you just dont move more than 1 200 tanks and 15 000 soldiers into a country within 12 hours without previous planning
5595006 were talking about pulling our troops away to the borders of south ossetia they will not be on georgia territory
5595007 russians have committed to withdrawing and they need to withdraw and so that is what we are looking for
5595008 we were all set and then the georgians came up with a bunch of new requirements with no time for us to act so the time to exchange prisoners was interrupted
5595009 russian forces continue to consolidate their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia

5595014 people dont become alcoholics as a side effect of the surgery
5595015 they become alcoholics for the same reasons anyone becomes an alcoholic the surgery is not a cure all for everything transpiring in the patients life
5595016 the surgery creates profound changes in people both physical and mental
5595017 even though theyre good changes they could ignite problems in people with active substance abuse problems
5595018 you shorten the time to the brain so much that if you liked alcohol before youll love it now
5595019 they always feel something is lacking and in order for them to feel ok they need to use something that boosts the dopamine in brain
5595020 it is a wise and prudent move the market is going through a period of uncertainty now but the chances of the market picking up in the next four years is quite high
5595021 they certainly have the capacity to wait it out and the four years gives them theoption of working out the best possible strategy

5595033 while negotiations on a government of national unity are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on 29 march
5595034 we hope that no one would do anything to breach the memorandum of understanding on the talks
5595035 we dont have consensus to reconvene parliament how do you reconvene parliament with an illegitimate government
5595036 the zimbabwean issue is far from resolved and so the continent as a whole has a responsibility to continue to engage with us in finding solutions
5595037 part of it is actually a process of trying to unlock the deadlocks that have emerged in the negotiations
5595038 is bakassi not part of the nigerian constitution did president obasanjo and now yaradua who approved the ceding of bakassi not swear to uphold that same constitution do nigerians understand what a constitution is and what about those who framed the constitution in the late 1990s did they not know that by then that bakassi ownership was under dispute should nigeria not have gone to any length to defend that constitution or should a national constitution be disregarded that casually

5595044 in all the sea turtle habitats and sanctuaries ive visited ive seen less and less sea turtles coming onto the beaches
5595045 this signals the qualitative destruction of the sea turtle habitat be it by pollution or beach degradation
5595046 usually fishermen release sea turtles because its considered bad luck to keep them but they tend to release them without taking out the hooks that caught them
5595047 one of the methods for adoption is to introduce a widespread campaign for fishermen to use a circle hook

5595051 our personnel deployed to the location were limited so that the flames cannot be extinguished totally
5595052 until now the fire is still raging frankly speaking we have difficulty in putting out the fire as the wind continues to blow hard
5595053 i had lots of field trips then we had a big problem with waste management destruction of natural flora and fauna there were also indications of the then future trend of global warming and ozone layer depletion

5595058 they saw the artificial lights and took the wrong route
5595059 the diners were at first quite curious and then someone alerted the coastal authorities
5595060 we successfully lured the calf about a kilometre out to sea probably the first time thats been done using a yacht as a surrogate mother
5595061 later we saw whales a bit further offshore and there was a slender chance it may have linked up with them but this morning we have got reports that it has returned to the western shores of pittwater
5595062 weve consistently said it was a slim chance that it might link up with its mother or other whales but the reality is that in the wild for various reasons mothers sometimes reject their young
5595063 looking at its behaviour the way it was nuzzling up to yachts would indicate it was primarily still suckling
5595064 it really was trying to suckle just below the waterline and against the keel with its head engaged against the boat
5595065 there is no place in california where frogs are still thriving
5595066 weve got to invest a lot more in research of the ecology of infectious disease

5595070 i often use samso as an ambitious example of how to cope with the big challenges that our own country faces in the race to become independent of fossil fuels
5595071 i think samso has set an agenda for the climate issue and alongside other projects it has shown that this is possible
5595072 we invested us 84 million a big number for 4 000 people but in reality its not a whole lot
5595073 first of all you need determination and can do spirit and then you need an economic foundation to make it possible
5595074 we held a lot of meetings but we managed to do it because we hired good experts and trusted our own instinct
5595075 what is intriguing about samso is their ability to make this project a sport for them to show that this can be done
5595076 what were trying to learn is how to do it how to achieve that level of energy renewable self sufficiency that samso and the community here have achieved
5595077 using resources that are locally available and producing it in a way that is self sufficient for the island while exporting green energy is something many nations would love to see

5595087 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance
5595088 the patience of our soldiers in trying to uphold the primacy of the peace process is very commendable but at some point we really have to act decisively
5595089 we will pursue and take aggressive action against the perpetrators of the dastardly acts committed against innocent civilians
5595090 we regret the loss of lives and property in lanao del norte but we would to emphasise that the milf leadership has not authorised these actions
5595091 if they cant control them the government will certainly control them and we will undertake our mandate to protect the people and the communities and we cannot renege on that constitutional mandate
5595092 everyone must think about the underlying forces that are at play here
5595093 these forces try to influence students entering universities to join student demonstrations that undermine development
5595094 the political parties that represent these students have fallen these parties know the result of the upcoming elections and are consequently trying to create problems for the government
5595095 the government has not taken a policy decision to have private universities says abewardene
5595096 but we should have private education that is my personal opinion anyone who can afford it is now sending children abroad even mortgaging their houses it is only poor parents children who in government universities that are being misled
5595097 i would like to ask where the jvp leaders children are educated are they in sri lankas state universities
5595098 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5595099 irresponsible drinking among young people college age and high school students and even those who are younger is a nationwide problem
5595100 westminster vigorously upholds the drinking laws of the state and the incidents of irresponsible drinking here are substantially lower than on most campuses across the country
5595101 i signed the amethyst initiative because i advocate exploring new ideas and new approaches about the best ways to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol i did not sign to advocate changing the legal drinking age from 21 to 18
5595102 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5595103 support an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21 year old drinking age

5595111 at least 26 new traders have started trading in steel in an effort to make quick money
5595112 steel prices increased until last month which attracted several new traders and speculators into the business but most of these new entrants have no adequate storage facilities and are keen on getting rid of their imports at the earliest possible moment
5595113 an oversupply of steel in the uae market thanks to a flurry of imports especially from turkey coupled with a slowdown in construction activity due to the extreme summer temperatures have played a role in bringing steel prices down
5595114 we are talking about people who have invested not just hundreds of thousands but several million they want their money back and so are willing to sell it with a reduced margin
5595115 there is a lull in the construction industry that will continue until the end of ramadan
5595116 the real impact will only be visible if the price fall becomes a long term phenomenon if it lasts for the next two years there will definitely be a difference
5595117 we buy our steel directly from factories in turkey and have been told that bookings for october and november are already being made at the rate that existed two to three weeks ago
5595118 some experts feared that the price would shoot up to 2 000 per tonne during august but exactly the reverse is happening we only hope that the trend continues unlike large contractors we are affected most by rising construction costs we have been struggling to meet the targets and are asking developers to absorb the cost
5595119 the governments commitment to keep construction costs down was very evident when it took measures to bring down the price of cement today despite a marginal hike the cement price is well under control it is steel and diesel that is playing a major role in pushing up costs
5595120 we cannot say anything definite though it is all based on supply and demand today the market is overcrowded and that is the reason prices have crashed

5595176 in the assessment of the election results its apparent the low voter turnout was due in part to the early election date
5595177 the decision to go to an early election has been shown to be a concern to many territorians
5595178 she was insistent on going and there was nothing anybody could do to persuade her otherwise
5595179 fixed terms will ensure territorians have a clear timeframe to which governments can be held to account
5595180 since then there has been a clash going on between nato and the taliban six taliban were killed after they blew up the bombs they had on their bodies two children have been killed and two more along with a woman have been wounded

5595209 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past

5595212 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections

5595239 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5595240 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5595241 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5595242 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5595243 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5595244 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology

5595253 uranium mining has taken our country away from us and destroyed it mining and the millions of dollars in royalties have not improved our quality of life
5595254 the greatest minds in the nuclear establishment have been searching for an answer to the radioactive waste problem for fifty years and theyve finally got one haul it down a dirt road and dump it on an indian reservation
5595255 for eight years in the white house every weapons proliferation problem we dealt with was connected to a civilian reactor program and if we ever got to the point where we wanted to use nuclear reactors to back out a lot of coal then wed have to put them in so many places wed run that proliferation risk right off the reasonability scale
5595256 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community

5595265 hmmm we realize that someone cannot mention everything in one column so that these are selected things that professor clayson has learned i am sorry that he has chosen to publish such negative stuff since there is a lot more to learn
5595266 i would just like to mention that calling those holding an opposing view stupid is nothing new
5595267 mccain is still considered the republican candidate for president while edwards is not
5595268 i have heard over and over again about mccains affair what channel are you watching i think it is one of the only things the democrats have that and showing pics over and over of mccain with bush as if because he took a pic with him he is just like him
5595269 jeroze doyou read anything other than left wing talking points
5595270 the polls are tied yet i cant find anything reporting that bit of info here or on the national sites why
5595271 what does it matter if mccain had an affair its common knowledge that obama had an affair as well
5595272 today prof clayson denounces the press for its religious reverence to obama he then tries to prove it by providing three examples
5595273 the bat thinkaboutit and mister t have apparently been living on the moon for a while and have been out of touch with events here on earth the fact that john mccain was fooling around with cindy while he was still married to carol is something that he admits
5595274 jeroze you are right on mccains affair i did not see the entire saddle back event i was watching the swimming
5595275 cross you kill me every week i cant help but think you read a different article than me each week because your generalizations of claysons intent and meaning behind is writing seams to be much different than what i read
5595276 i dont get it the title says it all now liberals everywhere are trying to say clayson did not learn these things
5595277 cire asks what does it matter if mccain had an affair
5595278 cross is your goal to be insulting to people because if it is you are surely reaching your goals
5595279 sorry cire i wont take you seriously anymore and please dont take what i just wrote seriously
5595280 if you watched that youtube video and thought they were being serious im beyond concerned

5595282 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5595283 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5595284 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5595285 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5595286 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5595287 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5595288 for eight years weve had a vice president who stayed in undisclosed locations trust me its already change we can believe in its just the next vice presidents identity thats undisclosed
5595289 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
5595290 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
5595291 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
5595292 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
5595293 she has the perfect place for a republican platform the washingtonpost com
5595294 if sen barack obama should choose hillary clinton i will stay home on election day and i am not alone
5595295 fail to act and whats been accomplished will be lost
5595296 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
5595297 if they would only let her into the debates and stand on the same stage with all the leaders people would be able to compare and see that for themselves
5595298 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5595299 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5595300 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5595301 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5595302 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5595303 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5595304 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5595305 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5595306 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5595307 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5595308 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5595309 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5595310 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5595311 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5595312 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5595313 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5595314 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5595315 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5595316 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5595317 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5595318 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5595319 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5595320 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5595321 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5595322 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5595323 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5595324 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5595325 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5595326 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5595327 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5595328 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5595329 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5595330 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5595331 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5595332 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5595333 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5595334 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5595335 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5595336 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5595337 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5595338 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5595339 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5595340 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5595341 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5595342 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5595343 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5595344 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5595345 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5595346 we must pull together and support the candidate for president who is on our side barack obama this is at the core of what it means to be a member of our union
5595347 theres not a single good reason for any worker especially any union member to vote against barack obama
5595348 theres only one really bad reason to vote against him because hes not white
5595349 were going straight at our people and talking to them about the differences between mccain and obama and the fact that race could be an issue you go straight at it
5595350 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5595351 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5595352 were sorry but the head you are calling has been disconnected
5595353 obamas granny has selected the vp she will announce this afternoon at 5 00 pm eastern time
5595354 who would have thought last year that me and t boone pickens would be in the same boat pulling the same oar the same way
5595355 when you go to the gas pump you dont check whether you are a democrat or republican
5595356 now dependent on foreign nations for 70 percent of its oil the u s is exporting 700 billion annually more than four times the cost of the iraq war
5595357 there are people standing by with billions ready to invest in the future sun wind geothermal biomass
5595358 we cant drill our way of this situation but we will do everything we can to produce more domestic energy just two years ago i pushed for 8 3 million acres of drill sites in the gulf of mexico now that is done
5595359 any credible domestic energy policy must reduce our dependence on foreign oil by at least 30 percent in the next 10 years
5595360 he understands the issues and is interested and excited by the work we are doing to educate and involve the people
5595361 importing 70 percent of our oil now thats an issue of security its going to take us 10 years to reduce our dependency by 30 percent
5595362 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5595363 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5595364 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5595365 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease
5595366 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5595367 the israelis have claimed for years that iranian uranium enrichment efforts are the first steps toward the development of a nuclear weapon a weapon they believe may be used on the jewish state
5595368 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
5595369 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
5595370 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
5595371 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
5595372 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
5595373 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
5595374 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
5595375 what do you want your look to say to people
5595376 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
5595377 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
5595378 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
5595379 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
5595380 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
5595381 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it

5595384 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5595385 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5595386 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5595387 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5595388 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5595389 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5595390 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5595391 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5595392 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5595393 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5595394 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5595395 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5595396 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5595397 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5595398 since man lives by the permission of physical geography it is his fate to be divided by mountains rivers and seas into groups that develop in semi isolation their diverging languages and creeds their climatically conditioned features customs and dress
5595399 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5595400 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5595401 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5595402 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5595403 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5595404 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5595405 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5595406 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5595407 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5595408 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5595409 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5595410 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5595411 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5595412 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5595413 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5595414 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5595415 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5595416 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5595417 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5595418 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5595419 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5595420 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5595421 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5595422 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5595423 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5595424 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5595425 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5595426 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5595427 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5595428 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5595429 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5595430 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5595431 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5595432 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5595433 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5595434 they have to be careful sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5595435 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5595436 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5595437 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5595438 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5595439 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5595440 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans
5595441 its their mouth they can use it to haul coal if they want to
5595442 the gallant kids from around here who lost their lives
5595443 it is the same exact people its the same f ing bunch of fight sing drink pray people who are over there who are over here in these mountains
5595444 youre damn right theyre on hadrians side of the wall is where they are and they want the scots irish vote well its true its f ing genes its who we are as a people well say f you to bush longshanks or maggie thatcher f any of em
5595445 bitterly clinging to their religion guns and antithapy towards others
5595446 im here to advocate for sen obama that we get a democrat into the wh
5595447 the film changed my life and my way of thinking i decided to do whatever i could
5595448 when i learned of their problem i decided to do something at least help them dig wells in their area which would provide a perennial source of water
5595449 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5595450 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it
5595451 the drive began in july and by the end of the month a total of 2600 was collected this money was sufficient to dig a bore well as well as fit an electric pump
5595452 i want to build rural maharashtra i want medical attention to be available to everyone and make physicians available in every village in rural maharashtra
5595453 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5595454 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
5595455 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5595456 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5595457 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5595458 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5595459 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5595460 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5595461 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5595462 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5595463 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5595464 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5595465 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5595466 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5595467 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5595468 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5595469 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5595470 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5595471 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5595472 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5595473 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5595474 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5595475 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5595476 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5595477 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5595478 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
5595479 10 6 gw the generation capacity of the six plants x 7884 hours of generation per year assuming 90 operational 83 57 twh y 83 57 twh y x 0 65 54 mt co2 y
5595480 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
5595481 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
5595482 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up
5595483 since i run a small computer repair business of my own i have a handful of guys working with me and i always stress to them that i want happy customers first through decent work and second by never making the customer feel stupid even if the customer made a mistake or did something stupid
5595484 although i like to think im practicing a little buddhist or socialist right livelihood here its also sound capitalism since happy customers not only come back they tell other people that your work was good and you treated them well and so they bring you more customers
5595485 we print critiques of obama all the time and dont have to go into your hyperbole
5595486 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5595487 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5595488 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
5595489 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5595490 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5595491 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5595492 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5595493 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5595494 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5595495 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5595496 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
5595497 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5595498 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
5595499 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
5595500 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5595501 environmentalists will be forced to compromise next year and support the development of clean coal nuclear power and other alternative fuels
5595502 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5595503 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5595504 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5595505 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5595506 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5595507 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5595508 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5595509 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5595510 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5595511 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5595512 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5595513 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5595514 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5595515 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5595516 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
5595517 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
5595518 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
5595519 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5595520 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5595521 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent

5595526 look at that delta plane its so small its such a small flight look its so small
5595527 you called me shaggy and you called me hippie and you called me grungy weve got like a combo of comments like a trombo
5595528 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5595529 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5595530 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5595531 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5595532 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5595533 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5595534 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5595535 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5595536 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5595537 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5595538 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5595539 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5595540 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5595541 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5595542 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5595543 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5595544 obamas challenge is the fruit of bob kuttners lifetime of engag reporting analysis and advocacy it is riveting brilliant and persuasive kuttner in concise chapters written with great vigor and clarity shows what the change could look like if obama is bold enough to go for it and the gods continue to smile on him

5595549 this would have led to the saa not being able to deploy its routes in america
5595550 it was jordaan who had convinced the inspectors from the faa and icaa to give the sacaa an extension
5595551 the reason for the faa and icaas actions was the lowering of the technical standards of saa technical
5595552 that means that there is an accident waiting to happen
5595553 the freedom front plus had already in april of this year warned the government and requested it to take action at the time we said that the shortage of expertise in the aviation industry has the potential to force the saa to a standstill
5595554 airlines have to adhere to international standards and excuses by local officials will not be accepted to lose 300 workers in two years proves the incompetence of management to take action
5595555 otherwise we will be confronted with a catastrophe which will cost many lives
5595556 saa undertook to rather outsource work than compromise safety or employ competent whites
5595557 an aircraft will fall owing to this i guarantee this
5595558 he had a lot of positive energy that made people feel comfortable
5595559 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
5595560 emerging gnome trends set the dialog at guadec it was online desktop last year and gnome mobile the year before that
5595561 we are excited to see what the community brings to guadec this year
5595562 there is no dispute that the substance in question was cocaine the only issue is whether he was in fact snorting it or simply tasting it as he claims
5595563 i saw him holding a piece of paper and two matches to snort the powder
5595564 i believed it was some sort of drug the way he was inhaling it
5595565 it is the most stupid thing i have every done i dont even know what cocaine tastes like and i should never have contemplated putting the powder anywhere near my mouth
5595566 once again we see travellers turning to airlines because of problems with the rail network
5595567 imagine what would happen if government moves to increase air taxation forced airlines to discontinue domestic services
5595568 there would be no alternative should the rail network be disrupted and rail operators would not face any competition on pricing
5595569 given the current economic climate it is difficult to say that passengers not using the train have switched to the airlines
5595570 news will morph significantly in the more competitive environment of the web
5595571 we firmly believe that a transparent and credible media industry is vital to the health of the world democracy
5595572 weve also done our research and there are hundreds of surveys and papers that show that the public continues to fault news organizations both traditional and online for a number of perceived failures with solid majorities criticizing them for political bias inaccuracy and failing to acknowledge mistakes
5595573 julie dropped enough hints for me to realise she wanted me to ask her out so i did i never thought i had a chance because im a bit of a punk and shes gorgeous
5595574 the idea was that she should ride in on a brilliant white harley
5595575 but we quickly realised that it wasnt really very practical
5595576 i had a problem with what to wear for the big day as i dont do suits
5595577 i spend virtually my entire life in biker gear whether working or during my leisure time even i realised this wouldnt be on for the biggest day of my life when i knew julie was going to look wonderful so the solution was a kilt
5595578 part of the family has scottish roots and i love the place so i opted for the murray tartan which i am entitled to wear
5595579 we plan to spend as much time as we can touring on harleys
5595580 from being a teenager i had always hated harleys which i thought were too slow and too expensive
5595581 current systems often take two or three specially trained soldiers to operate them and cant be used by front line troops where the information is most needed
5595582 the military have an urgent requirement for surveillance support in urban environments and its likely they would deploy any new technology immediately if it was shown to be effective
5595583 we are looking for an experienced and successful leader to work with the police authority the public and our staff to make the people of cheshire safe
5595584 we are seeking high calibre applications for the post as we need someone who can lead a force which is committed to delivering effective and citizen focused policing
5595585 its my opinion that the 21 dogs have suffered as a result
5595586 i love animals and i would never throw a dog out on the street things really got out of hand and nobody would take them off me
5595587 in my experience people who are victim to sexual abuse as a child rarely get over it it can mean flash backs and memories triggered by something as simple as a smell
5595588 it impacts on people throughout their adult lives and can cause problems with relationships it can also cause difficulties in holding down a job because it can result in people having a mistrust of those in authority
5595589 the judge indicated that there was an overwhelming likelihood green will face an immediate and significant sentence of imprisonment when he is sentenced next month this can only be right and proper given the dreadful abuse he subjected a succession of young boys to
5595590 i would however urge them to either contact the police or speak to me in confidence in order to bring closure to their ordeal
5595591 we have co operated with the authorities since the beginning of the investigation
5595592 it is regrettable when something like this happens our priority and concern is always for the victims
5595593 i travel here daily on the trains and it has become a concern that stealing cabling is virtually epidemic
5595594 the train i travel on is delayed very regularly because people such as this defendant choose to steal the cabling
5595595 the reasons this happens is that the metal from this cabling can command a considerable price
5595596 this sort of offence is happening time and again causing disruption and inconvenience and financial losses to many people who travel on trains in addition there is danger caused to the system of the signalling which is interfered with
5595597 this is a case that needs a deterrent sentence and a message has to go from this court to others who may be minded to behave in the way you have
5595598 he had no idea of the massive inconvenience he had caused to the rail network the 40 50 pales into insignficance against the cost he caused
5595599 im in a state of shock and the thought of looking like this at 57 is terrifying
5595600 having seen these images i can honestly say i am never going to use a sunbed again
5595601 you can so easily get brown from a bottle these days there is just no point in ruining your looks and risking skin cancer by using sunbeds
5595602 i hope the horrible image of me will make other young people think twice before they next use a sunbed
5595603 while young people think sunbeds make them look good now in the long term they are doing serious damage to their looks
5595604 miniaturising medical diagnosis technology will bring major advances and it may even be possible for ordinary people to detect potential diseases by themselves just as they can measure their own blood pressure today
5595605 this means for instance breast cancer treatments could be less invasive as the cancer cells presence would be detected at an earlier stage

5595607 why are you ordering a salad when this place is known for their burgers

5595614 they say that we want renewable energy but we dont want you to put it anywhere
5595615 father thomas is a martyr he sacrificed his life for the poor and marginalized
5595616 but he did not die in vain because his body and his blood enrich the church in india particularly the church in andhra pradesh the southeastern state where he died
5595617 the church in india is shocked and deeply saddened by this barbarous killing the result of a growing climate of intolerance and violence against christians in this country
5595618 as the dust settles from the breakdown of the wto negotiations in geneva some parties are recognizing that there was a good package of results left on the table
5595619 it would be a mistake for the world economy and harmful for developing countries not to retrieve it
5595620 given the high food prices around the world and the need for poor people to lower their cost of food it just does not make sense for the doha negotiations to founder upon this barrier
5595621 since the purpose of a safeguard is to help cushion the effect of a significant increase in imports on local producers an acceptable justification for the safeguard could require examination of factors in addition to increased trade flows
5595622 a big problem with safeguards is that once a country triggers them it can take two years or more to challenge the grounds for imposing them
5595623 in the meantime the new barriers block trade so a compromise could create a speedy due process for challenges without appeal
5595624 this protection could be disciplined and limited it may be understandable that tired negotiators couldnt assemble these and perhaps other variables in a way to solve the problem
5595625 those who write me expressed their joys to me but also their worries their life plans but also their family and work problems their heartfelt expectations and hopes as well as the anxieties connected with the uncertainty that humanity is experiencing at this time
5595626 i can assure each and all of you of my remembrance especially in the daily celebration of holy mass and in the recitation of the holy rosary
5595627 i know well that the first service i can render the church and humanity is in fact prayer because by praying i confidently place in the lords hands the ministry that he himself has entrusted to me together with the destiny of the whole ecclesial and civil community
5595628 those who pray never lose hope even when they find themselves in difficult and even humanly desperate situations
5595629 how many examples in fact we can recall of situations in which it was precisely prayer that sustained the journey of saints of the christian people
5595630 among the testimonies of our age i would like to mention that of two saints whose memory we recall these days teresa benedicta of the cross edith stein whose feast we celebrated on aug
5595631 both ended their earthly life with martyrdom in the auschwitz concentration camp it would seem that their existence could be regarded as a defeat but it is precisely in their martyrdom that the brilliance of love shines which conquers the darkness of egoism and hatred
5595632 heroic proof of love was his generous offer of himself instead of a prison companion an offer that culminated in death in a starvation bunker on aug 14 1941
5595633 witnesses who succeeded in fleeing from the terrible massacre recounted that teresa benedicta of the cross while dressed in the carmelite habit and moving consciously toward death was outstanding for her peaceful conduct and her serene attitude and her calm behavior and attention to the needs of all
5595634 prayer was the secret of this saint co patroness of europe
5595635 and the foreigners who join themselves to the lord to minister to him i will bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer for my house shall be called a house of prayer
5595636 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5595637 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5595638 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5595639 we just want to make sure its not a problem
5595640 the search committee has done its job and will not hold any further meeting
5595641 i heard the rotors and looked east and here was this magnificent whirlybird
5595642 i waved my arms but i sank underwater i could see the spotlight hit my arms by the time i surfaced it was heading west
5595643 i said a prayer and the helo turned east i waved my arms and kept my head above water this time he flicked his light that he saw me
5595644 i had my lifejacket on my seat next to me
5595645 we suspected we had a person in the water in distress

5595730 lately ive been listening to a little bit of pop as ive been listening to punk for 12 years
5595731 its good to hear something different every now and then and find inspiration here and there ive actually taught myself how to play mileys see you again but i dont think the other boys in the band would go for playing that at the ep launch i sat down the other week to work it out and realised its pretty easy to play its a really catchy song maybe well see how it goes if you hit the right level of intoxication playing it might be a goer
5595732 i broke my arm at the big day out after i jumped the fence to take a piss in a more secluded spot i went belly up over the fence and snapped my left wrist i didnt quite think id broken it i just thought it was like when you stack a skateboard and you can shake it off i spent about an hour in the tent but stuck it out at the big day out for the rest of the day and i think i partied until about 4am when i woke up at 9am i realised it was broken and had to call up my mum to take me to the hospital
5595733 it would be nice to say it was but its actually just a sound we thought would be pretty cool and ive listened to many records but never heard the sound of someone skolling a can of wild turkey we got our mate to come in and skol a can since we had to stay pretty sober for the recording process red dog came in to do vocals on the secret song on the ep and then we thought while he was in the studio he could crack open a can there was a bit of pressure since that was the last can he had it turned out pretty good
5595734 even when im a mess i still put on my vest with an s on my chest oh yes im a superwoman yes i am

5595833 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5595834 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5595835 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5595836 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money

5595885 this is actually the fourteenth because some years weve done two
5595886 well we try to think ahead and we have a few tricks up our sleeve where we can add topical lines here and there into something that weve been doing for weeks and people always assume the whole things just been written when that happens
5595887 we start writing about a month of so before rehearsals anything before that just goes out of date and we get a bit panicky to start with and generally the feel of the show will dictate the content like this ones got a touch of waiting for godo t about it the beckett so theres more absurd and some might say silly stuff in the show as well as politics and it sort of works weve got a sketch about the iemma government thats sort of like a carry on doctor type thing with chaotic incompetent people everywhere you look
5595888 but thats the thing isnt it sometimes the real world is more absurd than comedy didnt us satirist tom lehrer retire after kissinger received the nobel peace prize saying something like theres nothing more i can do political satire is dead
5595889 the other thing is that in the revue form you can do that and as an actor and an artiste
5595890 you can play a whole lot of characters one after the other very quickly and some actors are horrified at the thought of doing that particularly those who spend weeks getting into a character and everything to say walk through that door and come out as a 75 year old woman is beyond them
5595891 we need to get four brendan nelson wigs because were all playing brendan nelson because hes everyone and nobody and hes everywhere and nowhere

5595895 if we had been able to catch them at the beginning of the game and stayed close then for sure yao ming should play a long time
5595896 but this was not a game not a time to have him on the court
5595897 for sure yao is a fighter he wants to play but he is a player i am a coach i am the guy who makes decisions
5595898 we can challenge any team in the world if we keep the momentum
5595899 maybe it was the first time in chinese basketball history that we play four games in a row so good
5595900 maybe we were tired today but this is professional basketball and we were not ready for this
5595901 the snap is the first three pedals which gets you out in front so you dont get cut off
5595902 thats 90 percent of the race to get out get your elbows in front and control things the race is over in 40 seconds so theres no room for error
5595903 when i won the test event race i realized this was my style of track
5595904 mental preparation was the key for me i wasnt the fastest rider but i handled the pressure
5595905 thats my style to sit back and let my riding do the talking

5595918 we not only lost the game but we may have also lost our catcher wang wei for the rest of the olympics he got hit in the leg they play hard and we play hard

5596002 un messaggio molto chiaro di solidariet nei confronti della georgia
5596003 that the circumstances are such that the belief is reasonable
5596004 a lawyer of reasonable prudence and competence would ascertain the matter in question
5596005 sorry you just dont have the clearance to see this stuff
5596006 youre asking me to tell you how were going to get to a place weve never been with a map i dont have
5596007 i want my own legal team and i dont want to be tried with these guys because of what were all being charged with
5596008 well i think its almost prosecutorial incompetence not to think in those terms its important that you do so
5596009 accounts of hartmanns bullying and intimidation of other lawyers participating in the process circulated
5596010 specific allegations that he was jockeying to have cases publicized and tried
5596011 was inappropriately aggressive in pushing for prosecution of certain cases that he felt had media value
5596012 if its behind closed doors its going to be viewed as a sham
5596013 who we will charge what we will charge what evidence we will try to introduce and how we will conduct a prosecution
5596014 as things stand right now i think its a disgrace to call it a military commission its a political commission
5596015 trust me you would have been impressed if only you could have seen what we did in the courtroom
5596016 if we dont get some cases going before the election this things going to implode
5596017 national attention focused on this dispute has seriously called into question the legal advisers ability to continue to perform his duties in a neutral and objective manner
5596018 when the government seeks the death penalty it must not reduce legal procedures to mere formalities the integrity of the system must be upheld regardless of the nature of the crimes charged or identity of the accused
5596019 the accused are entitled to due process and a fair trial
5596020 spray and pray charge everybody lets go speed speed speed
5596021 went from the freezer to the frying pan thanks to general hartmann
5596022 as a principle its really been around since alexander the great most military people understand this one

5596025 there arent enough players there are already too many overseas players and there isnt enough money in the game
5596026 roger lewis needs reminding that he was nowhere to be seen when we went through one of the most tumultuous periods in welsh rugby he was handed everything on a plate
5596027 as a direct result of the changes we had regional rugby two grand slams in four years problems solved over the millennium stadium debt and the union in profit none of that had anything to do with him
5596028 i like warren and recommended him to wales but he should stick to coaching
5596029 one of graham henrys problems when he was coaching wales was that he started to get involved with areas that were no concern of the national coach
5596030 nothing has changed that would make a fifth region work and its an insult to north wales to say that they should follow a development team who are likely to get thrashed most weeks
5596031 people have compared the idea to connacht in ireland but no one follows them

5596058 nei quarti contro rivas mi sono gestito troppo ma lui si chiudeva molto
5596059 e vero forse ho dato limpressione di gestire troppo le energie racconta il campione del mondo ma di fronte avevo un avversario che si chiudeva molto e lasciava pochi spazi
5596060 sicuramente con linglese price in semifinale sar un match molto diverso lui alto ma io sono pi veloce e sicuramente posso alzare il ritmo rispetto alla sfida con rivas
5596061 il bronzo non pu essere lobiettivo di un campione del mondo attacca cammarelle la vittoria con rivas la considero come un normale passaggio del turno lo dico chiaramente un altro risultato diverso dalloro sarebbe una grande delusione
5596062 if you live in this country and you put on a russian uniform you are not a patriotic person
5596063 one of our favorites is a necklace with a bezel wrapped with real antique french lace bows with the phrase

5596066 mr young could have done a walk through to look for items that were missing or out of place
5596067 he could have provided the names of persons that may have had a conflict with him or his wife he could have provided information on recent visitors or workers that may have been in the residence
5596068 ive seen more death on the highway than id like to think about
5596069 the roads themselves should be safer than they were in the past
5596070 is it people driving drunk is it people who have no license and maybe dont understand our rules who are dying and causing deaths
5596071 alcohol is also involved in a lot of these fatalities
5596072 from time to time therell be a spike in highway deaths its just one year that it spiked so far this year were significantly down
5596073 if youre doing 65 theyre doing 95 you expect somebody to yield and they dont
5596074 i talk to troopers and i ask them why people here dont signal before they change lanes they say to me we dont enforce that unless theres an accident i mean you gotta be kidding me
5596075 if you go into virginia you dont dare go fast on i 85 between the end of our state and richmond the police are up there and people know theyre up there so they slow down and take it easy
5596076 so obviously theres a lot more people driving on the highway than troopers
5596077 were out there doing our part doing what we can to try to combat that dwi problem in our state
5596078 they ought to hire a slew of them and let them get out there and do their jobs
5596079 meanwhile we just have to be prepared to protect ourselves when were out there
5596080 both groups cause panic and fear and havoc within our communities
5596081 one did it based on the color of someones skin and the other does it based on the color of a piece of cloth
5596082 but after the federal government became involved their influence faded we want to do the same with the gangs
5596083 obviously the gang legislation passed by the state was a good start
5596084 it allowed us to standardize what a gang is and provides funding for prevention and intervention
5596085 isnt enough but were very encouraged by that level of funding
5596086 we have to have that we still have levels of violence that are unacceptable but those are two significant changes weve seen
5596087 he could still be on the streets of miami either hurting somebody or having somebody hurt him
5596088 instead hes going back to school this fall to finish his degree and hes got an olympic medal
5596089 i made so many mistakes because i wanted to win so bad
5596090 i realized track could get me out of the streets of miami
5596091 the people at st augustines college its a small place but i want to show them that no matter what school you come from the sky is the limit you can do anything you put your mind to
5596092 i really thought they were dead the way they had gotten hit
5596093 based on what happened nine out of 10 times its going to end up worse than it did
5596094 he is a super kid it seems as though he made a bad judgment
5596095 and i cant imagine what the parents of those girls are going through we hope that everything gets better that they make a full recovery and there are no side effects of any of this
5596096 hes a person whos never been in trouble in his life in any way
5596097 parents get angry when theyre spanking and its not working
5596098 if a child gets spanked so often they just dont care anymore and will misbehave anyway
5596099 people want to change behavior immediately and they think spanking is the way to go
5596100 down the line though these children do far worse that relationship of trust is broken
5596101 spanking can be administered in a loving manner to help children understand whats right and wrong
5596102 but its not just something that ought to be done with little thought
5596103 plastic plumbing pipe a 3 foot shrub cutting or a belt
5596104 it broke my heart i worried about him hating me
5596105 he made a poor choice he made a wrong choice
5596106 i dont know what they paid the postal service but they obviously didnt get what they paid for
5596107 its really a challenging time in young students lives because they are on their own for the first time
5596108 some kids who have been sheltered they find it difficult to just transition from having parents providing three meals a day to making their own selections
5596109 freshmen have a schedule packed with classes that makes it difficult to eat regular meals
5596110 i encourage them to look at their class schedule and find times to eat their meals its not a good idea to rush to class and not eat anything until 2 p m
5596111 i know a lot of college students really enjoy sleeping late and then rushing to classes but i think its really important to take time for that meal
5596112 they dont want to miss the social experience but i tell them they can enjoy their friends without eating again if theyve already had dinner
5596113 during finals we had an ice cream night and a doughnut night
5596114 and you can almost always find someone who wants to order pizza
5596115 i recommend that when they go to a dining hall they first start with a salad or soup
5596116 which has been shown to curb appetite and then later eat food that is more calorically dense
5596117 the hardest thing is to just let students know there are resources available
5596118 that there is a dietitian on campus that students can see for free
5596119 im not sure theres a whole lot that could happen to me as far as winning and losing or being benched starting or not starting that i havent been through already
5596120 he has a much better knowledge of the offense than the other two youngsters because hes been in it
5596121 its amazing that hes been able to accomplish what he has thus far given all the things weve asked of him
5596122 i feel like ive got certain talents and i use them to the best of my ability
5596123 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5596124 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5596125 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5596126 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5596127 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5596128 their goal is to get as much in them as possible before they go out because once theyre out they cant get caught with alcohol
5596129 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5596130 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5596131 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5596132 i tell you my friends do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more but i will show you whom you should fear fear him who after the killing of the body has power to throw you into hell yes i tell you fear him
5596133 when theres nothing left to burn you have to set yourself on fire
5596134 over the weekend i danced with the pussycat dolls for one night in vegas it is about time ha ha robin antin the creator and choreographer of the pussycat dolls as you know is a good friend of mine and we have been dreaming this up for almost two years it finally came true over the weekend

5596136 our findings illustrate that the abiotic synthesis of hydrocarbons in nature may occur in the presence of ultramafic rocks water and moderate amounts of heat
5596137 hydrocarbon production by ftt could be a common means for producing precursors of life essential building blocks in ocean floor environments or wherever warm ultramafic rocks are in contact with water
5596138 we have probably failed to understand that the russians are really quite serious when they say we have interests and were going to defend them
5596139 russia does have interests and at some point theyre going to stand up and draw lines that are not simply to be ignored

5596145 we can console ourselves with the fact that her legacy will be that she taught thousands of women and children throughout the world who have benefited from her work
5596146 she was an extraordinary young woman who was absolutely passionate and worked tirelessly for people particularly women and children all over the world
5596147 she would often be in war torn or disaster torn countries but she would helping to better their lives we are very proud of that
5596148 she was so focused highly intellectual and had a great capacity for hard work but when she came home to suffolk she would just slot back into family life
5596149 the bus was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge at the bottom and from what i can see at the scene that bus has not managed to go round the bend and has careered through a wall and down a drop into a garden
5596150 theres a bus in a difficult situation which crews have had to secure and obviously the crews are working very hard in difficult circumstances
5596151 i heard this massive crash rumble of either crunching metal or what sounded to me initially as a thunderstorm as it was heavily raining before
5596152 then after that we heard shouts and screams so we obviously put it down to a crash
5596153 when i got to the scene there was a bus overturned it looked like it had ploughed into a car and then down a neighbours driveway into the garden
5596154 it must have dropped about 20ft 6m it was on a slope its diagonal not head first
5596155 there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus there were many walking wounded all being seen to by the ambulance staff
5596156 its a narrow country road its mayhem absolute mayhem we had a torrential downpour of rain just before it happened
5596157 i was in the local pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets
5596158 we all went to help but the area had been cordoned off by police
5596159 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5596160 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5596161 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5596162 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5596163 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5596164 its really rare to have five big name acts from canada perform on the same stage on one night especially at the low ticket price we are offering we encourage everyone to come out and enjoy a night of diverse musical canadian talent

5596166 boredom arises not for a lack of things to do but the inability to latch onto any specific activity nothing engages us despite an often profound desire for engagement and so few things engage me these days

5596169 weve been training together for a long time and we had the same goals growing up
5596170 obviously 2004 was a huge year for him and i didnt quite make the team for different reasons he gave me the wrist band to try to inspire me it was a small thing from a friend that meant a lot
5596171 i didnt make a big deal out of it i just gave it to him
5596172 in 2004 he didnt make it not because he wasnt good enough but because he had an injury
5596173 mark was held down by his left hand and i was giving him something to put on his left wrist to remind him of the fact that he deserves to be here and he will be here
5596174 we both kind of knew what it meant and that it was a special thing
5596175 when you are sitting on a good race you know when you have prepared well and everything is going well you feel good on the water at the right times its just kind of a confidence thing
5596176 hes an inspiration showing that a canadian can succeed at that level

5596181 i went to get one of my poles and it wasnt there
5596182 we bring the poles inside a tube and give it to organizers so they can take the poles to the place where we are going to compete but they lost one of the poles somewhere along the way i dont know what happened
5596183 i wanted the officials to stop the event so they could figure out where the pole was but they kept saying i needed to go looking for it myself
5596184 that pole was essential if i wanted to get over the 4 55 and the 4 65 marks
5596185 i wish she took a medal from this because she is ready

5596207 will give developers a chance to build polished applications once hardware is available
5596208 due to significant api changes in the upstream open source project and due to the timeline of getting certain bluetooth profile implementations certified a comprehensive bluetooth api will not be possible or present in android 1 0
5596209 due to the security risks inherent in accepting arbitrary data from outside the device the data messaging facility of the gtalkservice will not be present in android 1 0

5596211 we look forward to the possibility of restoring some or all of this functionality in a later version of the android platform

5596273 americans need to get over the political bigotry that there are only two parties
5596274 must be astonishing to canadians who have a multiparty system
5596275 mainstream political parties can essentially cooperate in failing to even attempt to solve problems faced by a majority of citizens usually because they have been funded and supported in other ways by large corporations

5596336 similar to the results for the first quarter of 2008 our results for the second quarter reflect the continued successful implementation of our profitable rapid growth strategy we achieved marked growth in sales that is a combination of accelerated organic growth in our core activities at a considerably higher rate than the growth rate in our industry and the contribution of the seven strategic acquisitions made in 2007 which were successfully merged into our global activity the continued trend of improvement to profitability is firstly due to the completion of most of the merger process of the acquisitions which according to plan began contributing already in the first quarter of the year not only to sales growth but also to the improvement in profit and margin and secondly due to the steps we took to adjust our products selling prices to the price rise in raw materials used in our production
5596337 frutarom will continue to act resolutely to achieve ongoing high profitable organic growth of our core activities to adjust the companys selling prices to price increases in raw materials used in production if they should occur and to concentrate on guarding and improving margin levels frutarom will also continue to strive to achieve optimal efficiency from the seven acquisitions made in 2007 and to extract and maximize the many cross selling opportunities in the acquisitions made in recent years we are satisfied with the rate of organic growth and the seven acquisitions that we made in 2007
5596338 frutarom will continue to invest considerable effort and resources in the continued implementation of our rapid growth strategy and in seeking and performing additional strategic acquisitions in order to continue strengthening our position as one of the global leaders in the field of flavors and unique ingredients

5596370 laconi ca is not a service but rather a technology and the founder and developer evan of identi ca i think recognizes that were seeing this as so many other microblogging services have come up recently some others even open source identi ca will evolve as it builds around this basic technology of microblogging and finds new ways to use it whats great is that theyre sharing the basic technology so that others can do the same and build their own creative services around the technology
5596371 identi ca is an open network service our main goal is to provide a fair and transparent service that preserves users autonomy in particular all the software used for identi ca is free software and all the data is available under the creative commons attribution 3 0 license making it open data the software also implements the openmicroblogging protocol meaning that you can have friends on other microblogging services that can receive your notices the goal here is autonomy you deserve the right to manage your own on line presence if you dont like how identi ca works you can take your data and the source code and set up your own server or move your account to another one
5596372 laconi ca is building an actual protocol underneath it all where other types of software can also communicate with laconi ca this would put it almost in the same realm as sendmail which communicates with other mail server software via the smtp protocol or even apache which communicate with other web servers via the http protocol or even bind which communicates with other dns servers via the dns protocol i could go on and on evan prodromou the founder of identi ca is not just building another microblogging service hes developing a standard along with software that adopts that standard so that you too can build software that communicates with that standard this is profound and in my opinion we havent seen such innovation and selfless development of new communication techniques since the invention of the web itself identi ca is in many ways building an entirely new open layer of the internet add to that the shared api built around the service and the fact that any software written for identi ca will work on almost any other laconi ca platform with just the change of a host name and you can quickly see the power of identi ca and the software that powers it twitter seems to be completely ignoring this as they shut the doors on developers try to develop entirely in house and build an entirely proprietary system businesses will quickly realize this build software on the laconi ca platform and as the customers and communities that follow those communities flock to their platforms they will also naturally join other supported services such as identi ca users will soon have no reason to be on twitter any more if nothing is done i always said developers would begin the demise of twitter and laconi cas making it awfully easy for that to happen unless twitter adopts and opens up in a major way they will fail
5596373 this one simple and amazing example goes to show that we have only hit the tip of the iceberg here on microblogging technology
5596374 it looked like we were flat we didnt come out to play

5596380 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect fire
5596381 our commando units were deployed into the area and engaged the attackers and pushed them back
5596382 so far 13 attackers have been killed six blew themselves up six others died in the explosions and one died in gunfire from commandos their bodies have been recovered
5596383 thirteen suicide bombers were killed in kijran area of ali sher district
5596384 they were fired at we have found six bodies which were all wearing suicide vests
5596385 some of them have blown themselves up others are hiding in nearby houses and corn fields the troops are searching for them

5596391 the rate of fee increases is levelling off as non executive directors and the boards that employ are working harder to balance fees with the responsibilities that come with the role
5596392 were seeing much more emphasis on reviewing fee structures and levels over half of the companies we surveyed had carried out a review during the last 12 months historically non executive directors fees were reviewed every three years so this increasing frequency signals a significant shift
5596393 as fee increases become more moderate we can expect more focus by institutional shareholders on the disclosure of the neds effectiveness rather than merely what they earn
5596394 for me one of the joys of writing is articulating something i have felt but never expressed before
5596395 there was no message in the film other than that the film was good
5596396 it wouldnt have taken einstein to work out they were holding something like that
5596397 the problem weve got is that we dont know what theyve got because it is such a secretive investigation we dont know what they are holding
5596398 im sure they have got all sorts of things that they are keeping
5596399 why did they criticise that instead of using it as a vehicle to help them
5596400 if they couldnt enhance it why didnt they release it anyway at the time when it was really fresh in peoples minds
5596401 the other thing is that very often someone is keeping a secret and that person may be a wife or a mother but putting that sort of pressure on 12 years ago could well have tipped somebody
5596402 twelve years on that person could be dead they could be divorced it really does beggar belief

5596405 i started to get worried that he hadnt come back yet
5596406 when he pulled me out of the car and when he was tying me up he was shaking more than i was
5596407 the man didnt say anything the whole time when i tried to talk he put his hands over my mouth to stop me
5596408 i was extremely scared i kept wondering where he would be taking me why he had taken me and i was trying to think what i or my family may have done to cause someone to kidnap me
5596409 i thought that i was going to be killed during the drive when we stopped and i was dragged out of the car and my clothes cut and ripped off me i also thought that i would be raped before i was killed
5596410 during the week that i was with him we ate very little the third day my boyfriend caught a snake he killed it with a stick but we were unable to make a fire and therefore we didnt eat it as we didnt want to eat it raw
5596411 the fourth day i ate blackberries and raw fish my boyfriend was walking in the river and a fish jumped between his feet he grabbed it and killed it again we were unable to make a fire so we shared the fish and ate it raw
5596412 i gained consciousness and located a knife and freed myself and then freed my girlfriend
5596413 basically he told me that if we had sex it would keep us warm and we would have a better chance of survival and that we would be married before god as we had had sex
5596414 i think that most days he would say it was getting colder and maybe i should reconsider having sex with him to keep warm

5596446 i could not become anything neither bad nor good neither a scoundrel nor an honest man neither a hero nor an insect and now i am eking out my days in my corner taunting myself with the bitter and entirely useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot seriously become anything that only a fool can become something
5596447 i dont think people are meant to be by themselves thats why if you actually find someone you care about its important to let go of the little things even if you cant let go all the way because nothing sucks more than feeling all alone no matter how many people are around

5596453 habiendo mantenido constantes los factores que en ocasiones anteriores confluyeron para la creaci n del fuego paneles media sombra y p blico que hab a dado muestras de su afici n a la pirotecnia chab n carec a de motivos razonables para confiar en que no se producir a nuevamente un episodio de tales caracter sticas
5596454 chab n no es responsable de la tragedia y vamos a demostrar que el incendio fue intencional

5596456 est de buen estado de nimo pero con mucha ansiedad cu nto m s se acerca la fecha m s ansioso se pone ya me dijo que quiere asistir a todas las audiencias
5596457 no hay dudas de que el hecho se trata de un estrago doloso pero las defensas van a tratar de que la figura sea culposa para que sea excarcelable
5596458 no implica ni alcanza como consecuencia necesaria la muerte de los all presentes
5596459 ellos eran m sicos que iban solamente a tocar y no entend an nada de seguridad ni de habilitaciones por lo que nunca se iban a imaginar que en sus recitales iba a haber un incendio
5596460 s lo los une el espanto de considerarse inocentes y tener que e ir a un juicio oral por 194 muertos
5596461 cualquier intento por parte de rusia de recrear la guerra fr a en europa y antiguas rep blicas sovi ticas y estados sat lites fracasar
5596462 tenemos que rechazar los objetivos estrat gicos de rusia que estaban claramente encaminados a socavar la democracia de georgia a usar su capacidad militar para da ar y en algunos casos destruir las infraestructuras y a debilitar el estado georgiano
5596463 rusia no puede tener las dos cosas no puede actuar como lo hizo en la guerra fr a y esperar que se le trate como un socio responsable al mismo tiempo
5596464 es un estado que desafortunadamente usa el instrumento que siempre ha utilizado que es la fuerza militar
5596465 voy a hacer lo de siempre est bueno volver a empezar con la base es enganchar otra vez a tu p blico

5596482 si bien el decomiso aumenta las fronteras de las zonas sensibles como el norte se mantienen porosas y permeables al ingreso de grandes cantidad de coca na lo que se amplifica ante la falta de un buen sistema de radarizaci n
5596483 es necesario mejorar el control de calidad de las medicinas y medidas para evitar que sirvan como insumo til para prevenir desviaci n para la fabricaci n de estupefacientes porque el futuro del narcotr fico en la argentina pasa por los mediadores qu micos

5596485 en los dos partidos del torneo no jug bien es una realidad los futbolistas muchas veces tienen altibajos puede pasar por lo futbol stico o por los factores que se est n manejando hay que tratar de recuperarlo r pidamente
5596486 estoy muy conforme con villar aprovech su oportunidad es lo que siempre les digo a los jugadores no dejen pasar la oportunidad porque cuando juegan tienen que demostrar y l lo hizo su entrada nos dio mucha frescura
5596487 el funcionamiento del equipo fue otro estoy muy conforme con el segundo tiempo y la actitud fue la mejor jugamos contra un buen equipo y en base al orden la actitud y el juego pudimos sumar
5596488 no podemos mirar para adelante cada partido es una final y solamente pensamos en hurac n
5596489 the combination of infrastructure elements such as presence and ip telephony collaborative tools such as shared directories and calendars and contact center technologies is one of the keys for companies looking to provide a stellar customer experience
5596490 however the weak integration of the disparate elements of acds cti servers outbound dialers self service technologies such as ivrs and a new breed technologies like voice portals in legacy contact centers frost amp sullivan believes that it will take unified contact center suites such as aspect unified ip to truly tap the full potential of the contact center

5596492 lo cierto que es que se agota el tiempo vamos a llevar adelante acciones sobre el congreso y si no hay soluciones para nuestros reclamos declarar antes de fin de agosto la vuelta de la protesta global esto ser a un paro agropecuario o la no comercializaci n de granos

5596498 no es lo mismo producir leche en zona de alfalfas que en otras regiones donde cuesta m s la alimentaci n de los animales y cambian los rindes
5596499 esperamos que el plan lechero contemple costos diferenciados para los diversos sectores de producci n ofreciendo distintas alternativas de insumos porque un tambo que produce 30 o 40 mil litros de leche consigue los insumos a un precio menor que el peque o y mediano productor
5596500 esto va en detrimento de los peque os productores lecheros que no pueden competir con los precios de los grandes
5596501 no entregan los certificados y un tr mite que antes tardaba dos d as hoy lleva m s de diez sin respuesta

5596503 no pretendemos que el estado subsidie la producci n pero s que intervenga con medidas concretas como la desgravaci n impositiva en la compra de insumos internacionales
5596504 la liberaci n de las exportaciones de carne debe ser inmediata y despu s hay que dise ar estrategias que impulsen la cr a de ganado pol ticas que hagan que sea m s rentable guardar las madres para cr a que venderlas al matarife

5596607 i heard what i thought sounded like thunder and the next thing i knew my front door was being banged on
5596608 there were 12 or 15 young people standing there crying and with blood running down them
5596609 they said there had been an accident they couldnt speak much english
5596610 i rang 999 and went outside i was astonished to see a bus
5596611 it had dropped through my neighbours garden it must have fallen about 15 feet and had rolled over all these people were crying i ran out with some towels and blankets
5596612 the bus was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge at the bottom
5596613 from what i can see at the scene the bus has not managed to go round the bend and has careered through a wall and down a drop into a garden
5596614 alton towers first responders were on the scene within minutes of the accident occurring and the resort is now providing assistance with casualties who are being brought back to the park

5596617 i was in the local pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets
5596618 we all went to help but the area had been cordoned off by police
5596619 there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus
5596620 the majority of the people were walking wounded probably half a dozen had serious injuries
5596621 from what i could see a coach had crashed at the hill and ploughed through a neighbours garden
5596622 it ploughed through two cars parked in a driveway one of them was bouncing down the road the other must have flown along with the coach
5596623 it was on a slope its diagonal not head first
5596624 theres a bad bend at the bottom of the hill which is in line with the neighbours driveway
5596625 i saw the coach flying through the garden and just dialled 999
5596626 i grabbed a loud of towels and took them out
5596627 it is bad it is just awful to think that someone has lost their life and so many people have been injured
5596628 it has been a bit sombre in the pub tonight and that is what everyone has been talking about

5596696 i just thought steve by a shade but it was too close to call
5596697 if it takes two it takes two if it takes five it takes five
5596698 i always think you need four and well have four ready
5596699 in the last seven years at west virginia weve used multiple backs
5596700 at times weve had three that played at a fast tempo you run more plays anyway so you want to keep em fresh keep em rolling naturally if a guy got a real hot hand youre gonna keep riding him but were flexible
5596701 and basically plan out who are the guys who are in the potential two deep and who needs to be on the scout team
5596702 ill never be able to get that out of my head i guess you learn to move on and its something you have to live with
5596703 i remember him saying god wants me to go to michigan
5596704 after that i started sleeping a lot better because i knew what kind of men were going to be taking care of my son
5596705 he doesnt let his pain affect him were trying to help him along any way we can but he wants to be just like any other guy
5596706 you could tell he was gonna be a ballplayer the day he got to the ballpark
5596707 im just playing a game the only way i know how
5596708 i guess my speed makes it exciting and i guess i do have the ability to break it open at any time but i feel like a lot of guys have that
5596709 he has good presence for a young guy it looks to me like hes going to be very very good hes got extraordinary ability
5596710 i think you factor any way you can to have all of your possible weapons available to become as good as you can become and most especially at quarterback
5596711 he just looks the part of the returning quarterback from a good team
5596712 every time i go out there i feel that much better about myself
5596713 im still working on the little things and trying to do it right all the time
5596714 ohio is the buckeye state and ohio sports fans give their heart to the college team unlike some states where college football isnt strong and professional sports are what matters
5596715 sometimes when youre competing you want to do a little bit extra to set yourself apart
5596716 the thing weve been trying to stress is the thing that sets you apart is just following the plan
5596717 i dont know how many points we averaged last year but if we practice the way we did saturday well be on the same path
5596718 it hasnt been as tough as i thought it would be its a blessing to be back
5596719 hes much much improved with knowing where to go with the football
5596720 i dont mean that wrong he likes to turn on balls and look for pitches he likes to hit the ball out of the ballpark if he hit 25 home runs and hit 270 hed be a star
5596721 but if youre trying to hit home runs when youre hitting 210
5596722 im trying to say this as a compliment i think hes really working hes at least making an effort but he should be able to hit 260 270 with some production
5596723 hes working at it and we need him to work at it because he needs to be a productive player for us next year but if you go up there take too many pitches get one swing and with that swing you try to hit a home run that adds up to about 210
5596724 i think weve finally gotten through to him a little bit though catching he needs a lot of work but i think hes going to be fine
5596725 acknowledging that you havent given up on this season isnt the thought of a season attractive in which you know from the start where carlos guillen is going to play where inge is going to play and where miguel cabrera is going to play
5596726 im comfortable with all that but our no 1 thing is to re evaluate our pitching and thats kind of tough because we dont know about jeremy bonderman we dont know about dontrelle willis we dont know about joel zumaya
5596727 thats one of the main reasons were at where were at when you have to tinker with your pitching for the most part you are doomed thats no 1 for me
5596728 our quarterback was touched a bit more on the other side than were used to
5596729 you know sometimes you walk off the field and say man we just kicked their butts
5596730 but you look at the film and say woo we actually didnt this wasnt one of those times
5596731 as coach rod marinelli always says you are what is on your tape it makes you feel good that the day after a game when you see the things we are preaching are coming together we got a long road to go but i think we are on the right path i feel good about where we are right now
5596732 they not only are one of the biggest offensive lines in the nfl but they are really good we threw out a challenge to not only our entire defense to not only stop the run but we wanted to get after the quarterback it looked like we got after him pretty good and that is great to see
5596733 not only dewayne and cory but our entire defensive line is the piston in our engine that is driving the bus for us
5596734 the awesome thing about brian kelly is hes a technician
5596735 because hes a technician hes going to do it right and hes going to be in position the impressive thing is brian out competed him for the ball
5596736 not having to score a touchdown and then going to kick the extra point its going to be a lot easier just getting put in for a field goal and thats all i have to worry about
5596737 i thought this last weeks been really good for donnie coming in the first week it was different than what he had been used to his whole life hes been a football player now that hes just a kicker he doesnt have to go play running back or linebacker or anything like that it was an adjustment for him but hes made the transition real well and i thought he had a really good week this last week
5596738 i just had to really relax and stop thinking so much
5596739 sunday i really focused on relaxing in my warmups and my kicks and you could definitely see a difference it was definitely nice to have a comeback day
5596740 en los ltimos 18 d as entre el 1 y el 18 de agosto beijing report 9 d as con calidad del aire de clase i y los d as restantes de clase
5596741 his recovery had moved along more quickly than we thought
5596742 we still have to make sure that we protect him as far as not putting him at risk but hes doing well his strength is back and he feels good so were going to see how that goes
5596743 i think doucet will do a little bit more in practice than he did last week
5596744 i think hell be a little bit limited on some of the deep stuff so well have to control his reps a little bit but hopefully hell work his way back like anquan boldin did and hell be ready to go this week
5596745 evidently we didnt do enough work in the last 10 days
5596746 like i told them its my fault for trying to save them a little bit and not beat them up on the practice field so we came down here and got beat up in the game
5596747 as soon as we got back to practice amani showed me
5596748 hes the best in the business at that he knows just how to stay in even if he has to fall doing it

5596759 the paintings which simon sainsbury has bequeathed to the national gallery will make a huge difference to our impressionist and post impressionist galleries he will be remembered as one of our greatest benefactors as a trustee he was outstanding in his devotion to the gallery and during the construction of the sainsbury wing he was tireless in his supervision of the building work
5596760 simon sainsbury was one of the uks most private but generous philanthropists giving his wealth time and experience to numerous and varied causes especially in the cultural sector this is one of the most important gifts in the history of tate and these outstanding works will enhance many different areas of the tate collection

5596772 yeah haha sis i have to get going raf said he wants to meet me
5596773 i know you forgot thats why i had the perfect timing to get this gift for you
5596774 it was my grandmothers before she died she gave it to me since i was her only grandchild she told me to give it to the girl
5596775 i love you so much honey but you said you have something to tell me right
5596776 why do you look so sad its our anniversary you should be happy
5596777 i told you before i was leaving but since i had an accident my parents told me i could stay here for a couple of months but i still am going
5596778 but what if youre leaving youre taking my everything away from me you know i would die just to be with you right
5596779 i dont want to get to that point ok but just for a second listen to me
5596780 i managed to get 3 tickets to my flight my parents agreed on having you come with me one ticket for you one for me and one for our chaperon ate lydia i cant let my parents down but i can bring you with me to the us its your choice if you wanna come with me id be more than happy but if you wont its fine with me just as long you promise me we will still have contact with each other

5596790 i went out to taskers and bought a surveillance camera and put it into the eye of a teddy bear and put it in my mums bedroom
5596791 it didnt look suspicious because there was another teddy bear on the other side of the room
5596792 the offence was particularly serious because the victim was elderly and suffering from a terminal illness and the defendant had been specifically employed to make the victims life more tolerable and easier
5596793 whilst the amounts stolen were relatively small no doubt they would have been greater if not for the prompt action of the victims son in detecting the crime
5596794 i hope i can avoid surgery but the way it is right now its pretty bad pretty sore and i cant play
5596795 if its surgery then im out eight weeks and im done for the season but until the doctor tells me im going to hope for the best
5596796 there are a lot of things i want to accomplish you prepare to play a full season and when its cut short thats disappointing
5596797 my hope is that this will be big in bringing new riders to the sport
5596798 kids will see this on tv and want to race they may have seen their local bmx course but nothing like this

5596800 my dad was very excited when i decided to come to clemson
5596801 i felt like it was going to be tough especially at the quarterback position to have your son playing for you
5596802 i didnt want the pressure of trying to be unbiased because im not unbiased i love the kid i see the positives in him i didnt want to put the pressure on our staff that way and i didnt want my wife whos our water girl to tell me who should start at quarterback
5596803 as a coach i look at this roster we have landon donovan and david beckham as a starting point thats fabulous
5596804 i think we have a good group of players to join in and make this a good team
5596805 thats the rules and you have to play by them
5596806 i didnt believe him at first but then i was very happy when i found out
5596807 i was hoping i would have done a little better than what i did
5596808 most of them were long at bats they were not just a couple of pitches and see you later
5596809 a lot of them were five six or seven pitches i was seeing a lot of pitches which helped me out at the end i saw enough pitches that i felt good
5596810 knew how to delegate had the passion to inspire and established the vision the tone
5596811 ultimate example of a man who knew what he didnt know and was perfectly willing to admit it
5596812 in the fifty years my parents were married in the thousands of conversations my dad had with me it had just never come up and so there i was weeks after his death getting another lesson from him about the meaning of sacrifice and about the power of humility
5596813 it is a thrill to fulfill your own childhood dreams but as you get older you may find that enabling the dreams of others is even more fun
5596814 go out and do for others what somebody did for you
5596815 ive long held on to a clipping from a newspaper in roanoke virginia it featured a photo of a pregnant woman who had lodged a protest against a local construction site she worried that the sound of jackhammers was injuring her unborn child but get this in the photo the woman is holding a cigarette if she cared about her unborn child the time she spent railing against jackhammers would have been better spend putting out that cigarette
5596816 my colleague told me it took a long time but ive finally figured it out when it comes to men who are romantically interested in you its really simple just ignore everything they say and only pay attention to what they do
5596817 i wanted to help students learn how to judge themselves in the end educators best serve students by helping them be more self reflective
5596818 showing gratitude is one of the simplest yet most powerful things humans can do for each other
5596819 if i could give only three words of advice they would be tell the truth if i got three more words id add all the time my parents taught me that youre only as good as your word people lie for lots of reasons often because it seems like a way to get what they want with less effort but like many short term strategies its ineffective long term

5596844 in 04 as a young player it was really hard for me to lead with that group of guys especially with me not playing as much and not feeling involved compared to my role right now on this team its a big difference
5596845 we won by almost 50 points its kind of hard to get it going when youre already up by 40 ill be getting it going by wednesday im ready for wednesday
5596846 wanted to see where i was at and not slow down too much
5596847 i was pretty mad but had to get over it
5596848 it was unfortunate but hey you never know what happens nowadays
5596849 i still have the scars but im happy im thankful

5596851 if a person who has had a stroke can walk across a room i should be able to run 20 miles

5596862 the prices of houses seem to have reached a plateau and there is reasonable expectancy that prices will decline
5596863 houses cost too much for the mass market todays average price is out of reach for two thirds of all buyers
5596864 the goal of owning a home seems to be getting beyond the reach of more and more americans
5596865 the era of easy profits in real estate may be drawing to a close
5596866 if you are looking to buy be careful rising home values are not a sure thing anymore
5596867 most economists agree a home will become little more than a roof and a tax deduction certainly not the lucrative investment it was
5596868 were starting to go back to the time when you bought a home not for its potential money making abilities but rather as a nesting spot
5596869 financial planners agree that houses will continue to be a poor investment
5596870 what in the h e double hockey sticks is my problem
5596871 i am very pleased to carry on as club captain this season
5596872 it was my first season as captain last year and although i am 31 now i am still learning
5596873 i really enjoyed the responsibility last season everyone could see that and i tried to do the best job i possibly could
5596874 it was a really positive experience and this season i have to use that and carry on doing my best for the team
5596875 i know a lot more about the job now thanks to last season
5596876 it is true that we have the objective of doing better than we did last season so we have to keep on improving that has to be our aim
5596877 we are a young side and some more promising youngsters have come through for this season but they have all got the quality which you need to have if you play for arsenal
5596878 if you play at this club you must be ready to play at the very highest level

5596883 if you had a bunch of hardworking people that were making you rich youd want them to remain alive as slaves
5596884 you give them money from the time of birth until the time of death every house bought every car every boat the electricity the phones you name it they control it very hard to stop giving them money
5596885 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
5596886 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5596887 the preseason is important but i think the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off
5596888 we didnt make any plays i probably held the ball too long and made a lot of mental errors
5596889 we played them twice down in rio at the world league finals and we tend to be i think a little better when we play teams more often
5596890 i dont think well be surprised they have a great setter in nikola grbic a great opposite in ivan miljkovic so if we try to slow those two guys down i think well have a great chance to win
5596891 if youd told us going in that wed finish pool play undefeated i wouldnt have laughed but i would have been somewhat surprised
5596892 i dont think we played great at any point in time but weve just played real consistent and found ways either offensively or defensively to win matches
5596893 i think were starting to really adapt to different styles of play and the amount of effort our team gives every night so far has carried us through
5596894 eventually you have to retire and come out of retirement and then play again and then retire
5596895 i havent even retired yet and come out of retirement so i still have a little ways to go before i actually retire
5596896 it was hands on him showing me what i was doing
5596897 for me it always comes down to mechanics being tall theres a lot that can go wrong
5596898 i still have a month and a half left of starts and im excited about that
5596899 and theyre meaningful games another reason i wanted to come back from last year
5596900 we have been smart trying to get what we could and still have a physical presence but keeping our players healthy
5596901 you have to be careful of your players and try not to beat them up too much
5596902 we dont have the depth a lot of teams have you want your best 11 to be ready by the season opener aug 30 as of right now we will be 100 percent healthy for the first game
5596903 it is kind of par for the course we didnt practice nearly well enough this morning
5596904 we should not be patting ourselves on the back we are supposed to block for him
5596905 he is not supposed to be touched that is our job it is good he felt more comfortable but that is how it is supposed to be
5596906 we took a lot of grief as far as the offensive line goes
5596907 it was our fault whatever we couldnt protect willie the running game was not going that took its toll on us
5596908 you want to have bigger guys protecting the quarterback and pushing the pocket
5596909 i dont think our athleticism has changed a whole lot we are a little bigger but i still think they are very good athletes
5596910 we just recruited some bigger players that is how you want them i dont want to just get a bunch of big guys who cant move that is not going to help you
5596911 we have to clean up some stuff on our execution
5596912 we will show up one morning and not show up the next consistency is plaguing us right now
5596913 those five move this team we cant get anything started without them
5596914 only in a rural setting and with a life or death twist i called her and she read eye of the dolphin we had a meeting and were off and running on what became a pretty grand adventure
5596915 which is comiung out under the sony pictures classics label this spring she has been extremely busy with her work at the studios and i was afraid we might not be able to get her back for way of the dolphin but some things broke in our favor and now shes here
5596916 ive been doing this for a while and i didnt think id be super surprised at what was going to happen here
5596917 what he has done here will enable us to get our message out with a much bigger reach
5596918 michael phelps would be worth 40 or 50 million to nike
5596919 he could literally allow them to launch a massive swimwear company and i think you are going to see an incredible bidding war for him
5596920 we dont discuss contracts and that extends to future or potential sports marketing relationships
5596921 that connection will be tightened which we think will serve shareholders well
5596922 what is the value of eight golds in beijing before a prime time audience in the u s
5596923 id say 100 million over the course of his lifetime
5596924 its an aggressive number put out there by an aggressive agent
5596925 but also eight gold medals was an aggressive number not a good idea to bet against the man right now
5596926 were trying to get this stuff out the door as fast as we can
5596927 strange is our situation here upon earth each of us comes for a short visit not knowing why yet sometimes seeming to a divine purpose from the standpoint of daily life however there is one thing we do know that we are here for the sake of others for the countless unknown souls with whose fate we are connected by a bond of sympathy many times a day i realize how much my outer and inner life is built upon the labors of people both living and dead and how earnestly i must exert myself in order to give in return as much a i have received

5596931 i think that it is absolutely regrettable that the leader of fiji has decided not to attend the forum it would have been far better for the leader of fiji to sit down with the leaders of the pacific island countries and answer for the commitments that have been previously given by fiji to fellow island states
5596932 if someone is not prepared to come and be accountable for breaking commitments given to leaders a year ago that in itself speaks volumes so i expect that there will be a robust outcome from the forum
5596933 there is no reasonable excuse at all for fiji not attending the pacific forum i personally intervened to ensure transit visas were available for the fiji delegation to go through auckland airport to niue so they could be accountable to the forum leaders for commitments given last year
5596934 there are problems in terms of we have problems in terms of the taliban we have problems in terms of the porous nature of the border

5597400 i think its illegal and if its illegal what were talking about is the physicians causing the death of the three patients and that would be homicide its immoral i think it should be stopped
5597401 the whole area of organ donation relies on the public trusting physicians in that they believe they wont murder them or commit homicide they wont hasten their deaths

5597432 anything that doesnt fit into the political appointees ideological theological or political agenda is ignored marginalized or simply buried
5597433 the problem with this approach is that in public health as in a democracy there is nothing worse than ignoring science or marginalizing the voice of science for reasons driven by changing political winds the job of surgeon general is to be the doctor of the nation not the doctor of a political party
5597434 if bush is looking for a sg who is not necessarily distinguished or even qualified for the position but who will promote an untenable ideological position in the face of factual scrutiny and common sense why doesnt he get a creationist or climate change denialist

5597479 for people who love cats its very depressing to go into our existing cattery
5597480 its a cat prison we want people to go into a cattery that is modern that is clean that is attractive that they want to be in and that really showcases our cats
5597481 when you have as many animals as we do at the shelter and as many cats being euthanized we need to do something we truly do
5597482 is it necessary yes the conditions out there right now are deplorable
5597483 some things you have to complete city business has to go on
5597484 readjustment is not like a light switch that comes on automatically when they get home

5597492 if youre in an emergency room youre there to be treated you cant just sit and be neglected
5597493 our preliminary review shows the patient was treated promptly and appropriately
5597494 when we are finished we will drink some georgian wine
5597495 i think the public thinks you can just inject cells and have the patient feel better
5597496 it just will take us time to figure things out
5597497 in light of this new technology myc has really come into the spotlight its a really hot field

5597504 parson i thought i heard ms parson telling you not to eat salt
5597505 these have a lot of salt youre going to get in trouble
5597506 i dont have a theological question today lets talk about politics
5597507 yes im a little concerned about this election well thats not true im really frustrated about this election
5597508 the main thing is i think the voters are really stupid
5597509 yeah i know that but youre a pastor so youre used to people talking about you
5597510 all american voters are stupid ill give you an example of really stupid my aunt mildred was over last week she found out my dad is going to vote for obama do you know what she said
5597511 she stood right there in the middle of my kitchen and told us that good church people would vote for john mccain
5597512 he didnt say anything he just stood there so i told her that was the stupidest thing id heard this year
5597513 i dont know mom got mad and sent me to my room you didnt see me last week because i was on restriction for talking like that to aunt mildred
5597514 it wasnt too bad and it didnt do any good
5597515 well i guess there are different kinds of stupid parson but listen i really think we have a problem in this country look at my dad he keeps talking about this country has to not be dependent on oil did you know my dads a democrat
5597516 well so heres a democrat who thinks we should not be dependent on oil but he drives his car to work every day its only five miles to his office he could ride a bike to work every day i go all over the place almost every day and i dont use a gallon of gas so i think its really stupid to say we shouldnt be using so much oil and being addicted to your car thats what it is you know its an addiction
5597517 im saving you from a heart attack eating all that salt is really
5597518 you could say that anyway parson ive been listening to the news and what obama and mcclain are talking about and ive decided they are talking about nothing absolutely nothing
5597519 when are you adults going to make people who want to be president talk about real stuff when are we going to vote for people who will actually do something different
5597520 but both of them say theyre going to be different
5597521 thats right parson thats right everybody who wants us to vote for them say theyre going to be different and every election we keep voting for them i guess that makes us the problem
5597522 the problem with our voting system is the same problem the church has
5597523 my body is still intact sort of not all of my men were so lucky
5597524 i dont have feeling in my left arm leg or several fingers and cant fully control its use

5597602 in his will he left me a painting that had been in his basement for decades when i took it to get appraised the appraiser told me that it was an original picasso and worth several million dollars
5597603 but when i found out that i owned a painting worth several million dollars all that changed i quit my job moved to a new city and started a new life
5597604 but knowing that i had that painting under my bed made it possible i never worried because i knew that if worst came to worst id be ok
5597605 yeah but a few years ago i took the painting to another appraiser
5597606 a world famous antiques roadshow kind of bigwig and he said the painting was a forgery and it was actually worth 50
5597607 imagine if i had known that years ago who knows where id be right now

5597632 modern writers injure the smoothness of our tongue by omitting vowels wherever it is possible and joining the harshest consonants together with only an apostrophe between thus for judged in it self not the smoothest of words they say

5597635 mark we thought this was supposed to be about the original jewish olympics all we see here is a selection of various judaic olympic events throughout history

5597644 weve watched the games start and then all the british team get underway
5597645 now i want to get out there and show what i can do
5597646 i enjoyed playing other sports like football but not to a competitive level it was always going to be taekwondo for me
5597647 to be honest every open water race is different and i am not thinking everyones looking at me to get a medal

5597665 one thing that made mark invaluable was his institutional knowledge of the village of matteson
5597666 he was like an encyclopedia when it came to things around the village it really aided us a lot in decision making
5597667 he not only cared about matteson he cared a lot about the south suburbs
5597668 he adapted as the years went on and as things changed
5597669 there were few mayors who had the longevity he did
5597670 we want to make sure its a smooth transition because we have a lot of important things going on
5597671 this spiral has to be nipped in the bud and that means having interest rates at a suitable level until the threat of higher inflation has passed
5597672 all being well inflation will fall again next year and will be much closer to the two percent target by the end of 2009 but that will only happen if people dont chase inflationary wage increases

5597678 george was one of the founders of modern meteorology who transformed weather forecasting from qualitative guesswork to quantitative science
5597679 he was stingy with himself but where he did spend was things like tipping and making other people feel good about themselves
5597680 when my father died we were still somewhat young and george became our substitute father
5597681 he picked up a sense of responsibility for absolutely everything and carried through in that role as substitute father to the very end
5597682 he really cared for these things not because he wanted to possess them but because he wanted to create this resource for scholars
5597683 people form a collection and usually want to live with it and learn from it
5597684 he always solved his cases he would pursue the subjects of his investigations until they were adjudicated
5597685 sometimes you never believe an investigator who has this sort of macho kind of job would have this softer very delicate side to him but he was all about singing
5597686 he stepped up and said he could do it and he did an excellent job
5597687 he was a guy who loved to sing and loved society and was very devoted to his friends sometimes he would sing and harmonize for hours if there was someone singing at a piano he would be right over there
5597688 last weekend he had just attended his 50th class reunion

5597720 its interesting that when your boyfriend shared his fantasy with you you jumped right to the term cuckolding
5597721 by definition a cuckold is a married man whose wife cheats on him behind his back a cuckold fetishist on the other hand not only knows about his wifes dalliances but often enjoys the humiliation of being forced to watch
5597722 nothing about responsible nonmonogamy involves a free pass of any sort
5597723 its absolutely possible for you to transform your monogamous relationship into one thats nonmonogamous but you need to sit down and hash out the details including whats okay and whats not
5597724 its a little disappointing but all in all i tried to pull out what i could and im really happy
5597725 its my first time around and im definitely going to be here four years from now
5597726 i always look back at when i didnt have a dream when i didnt have a spirit
5597727 i didnt know what the olympics was all about i was just hanging out on the street i was not humble i was not a nice person doing things that were socially unacceptable
5597728 when you cant read or write at 14 or 15 in most cases youre headed for trouble and trouble was finding me
5597729 this is when i committed myself to track and field
5597730 i trained and i trained and i trained in the rain in the snow i began to feel incredible about myself
5597731 i said i cannot be denied what ive trained so hard for i stood up at this incredible runway in mexico city and said its time to take it to another level i ran down this runway it was so fast i couldnt even control it everything was relaxed i hit the board
5597732 ralph boston said you just jumped 29 feet 2 1 2 inches all of a sudden i was on the ground i just lost it
5597733 i thought this is unbelievable maybe ill wake up from a dream it was the most incredible experience of my life it was exciting it was unreal to even think i had jumped 29 feet i didnt even get a chance to jump 28 feet we went over 28 feet and went to 29
5597734 we have young guys but theyre good guys and they want to learn
5597735 i ran the math department i ran a dorm i did a little bit of everything out there
5597736 you understand the game its how to get the individual things done hanging out with alex helped a lot that was like a 24 hour information channel hes a great coach and a great communicator i listened to him and learned from him i dont know that he taught me everything he knows but he taught me a lot that i know
5597737 i think running backs coach bobby turner does such a great job of teaching those guys where to go how to cut where to feel
5597738 the whole system is based on everybody doing their thing and it just meshes with him teaching the running backs and us getting everything going we just tend to think the defense cant be right wherever they are well go somewhere else
5597739 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5597740 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5597741 the preseason is important but i think the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off
5597742 if i felt stiff its because i was standing around too much the last couple days
5597743 i hate to say its just two guys because our whole team has played really well
5597744 but those two guys are really playing at the highest level
5597745 being a leader of 11 other superstars you have to have a chip on your shoulders
5597746 thats just how ive wanted to play from the very beginning i dont think we can intimidate opponents but we can take care of business im just going out there and playing angry and trying to move forward each game
5597747 the best time ive had since ive been in the nba
5597748 i still dont know what happened there but for me individually it just wasnt good
5597749 i was 19 years old i thought i was good enough to be playing but i wasnt and being away from home for 37 days and not doing what you love to do was tough on me
5597750 they arent even in the same book i look at this as a team i look at that as a bunch of individual guys who never had a chance to become a team
5597751 he didnt fight him back marquand certainly could have beat that kid ive always told him how proud i was of him for not fighting back
5597752 hes a good player and above all he loves the game
5597753 when youve got a guy like that you can win with him
5597754 i got the biggest surprise there must have been at least 12 of them there that night
5597755 he had three that wanted him to go to miami three that wanted him to go to florida state it was so funny
5597756 its helped me deal with different kind of guys different characteristics attitudes
5597757 of course i love todd helton but hes 35 years old has a bad back cant hit for power anymore and his 16 6 million contract is dead weight cant we find a way to get rid of him but in a nice way
5597758 youve got to go home to that every night come here you need another hug
5597759 were pretty close brothers we have to watch the film after practice and
5597760 im really proud of him hes really stepped up when hes in there its hard not to root for him
5597761 every day im coming out here with the same mentality that i have to maintain my job every day and one slip and im out of there
5597762 it would probably be a little worse if klint did because we talk a little trash
5597763 my biggest challenge now is to keep pressing billy every day play smart and see what happens
5597764 youve got to have that mentality that you are going to play every game

5597986 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5597987 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5597988 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5597989 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5597990 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5597991 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5597992 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5597993 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5597994 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5597995 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5597996 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5597997 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5597998 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5597999 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5598000 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5598001 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5598002 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5598003 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5598004 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5598005 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5598006 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5598007 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5598008 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5598009 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5598010 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5598011 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5598012 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5598013 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5598014 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5598015 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5598016 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5598017 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5598018 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5598019 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5598020 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5598021 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5598022 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5598023 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5598024 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5598025 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5598026 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5598027 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5598028 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5598029 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5598030 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5598031 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5598032 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5598033 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5598034 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
5598035 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5598036 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5598037 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n

5598040 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5598041 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5598042 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5598043 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5598044 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5598045 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5598046 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5598047 god is the one who made all things and all things are for his glory he wanted to have many children share his glory
5598048 his unchanging plan has always been to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through jesus christ and this gave him great pleasure
5598049 it was a happy day for him when he gave us our new lives through the truth of his word and we became as it were the first children in his new family
5598050 lo siento no tuve otra opci n sino retirarme de la carrera

5598052 no me sent a bien mientras estaba calentando justo antes de la carrera sab a que mi pie fallar a
5598053 no soy de ese tipo de personas que se retiran f cilmente y creo que volver
5598054 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5598055 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5598056 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5598057 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5598058 no permitiremos que rusia dibuje una nueva l nea de separaci n en los estados que a n no est n integrados en la estructura transatl ntica como georgia y ucrania
5598059 tenemos que rechazar los objetivos estrat gicos de rusia que estaban claramente encaminados a socavar la democracia de georgia a usar su capacidad militar para da ar y en algunos casos destruir las infraestructuras y a debilitar el estado georgiano
5598060 rusia no puede tener las dos cosas no puede actuar como lo hizo en la guerra fr a y esperar que se le trate como un socio responsable al mismo tiempo
5598061 looks like me sounds like me but might not be me
5598062 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5598063 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5598064 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5598065 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5598066 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

5598070 il faut des initiatives sur le pouvoir dachat cest in vitable

5598075 we are aware that either of those violations could lead to safety issues for the students being transported
5598076 it appears now that the chances are less that central north carolina will get beneficial rains form the system
5598077 the mountains still have a chance but it will be later in the weekend
5598078 leave the winds behind and 3 to 5 inches of rain over 12 to 24 hours would be fantastic
5598079 it would be great to just not have to worry about it
5598080 i want to show people whats really going on and yeah you have a lot of enthusiasm
5598081 and you got some of those who just dont believe in it who just dont believe in the hype
5598082 registration does not equal voting and people register and they still dont vote
5598083 part of it will come down to actions of particular individuals and how hard people are working to organize people to the commitment
5598084 but i feel like when we start telling them they have to do this when they didnt cause it that becomes another cost of doing business
5598085 we have many citizen groups who have volunteered to do this type of clean up just to improve the neighborhoods and the city
5598086 and weve had places like lowes and home depot donate paint for it too in a worst case scenario the city would actually do the clean up and just bill the property owners for the services
5598087 what weve seen is that once you have graffiti youre going to see more graffiti
5598088 that area is going to become less safe people are going to think its a bad area youre going to see more crime
5598089 some of the gang graffiti is real and some of it is just kids doing it because they think it makes them a part of something
5598090 but its all bad for the city and the property owners
5598091 last child in the woods saving our children from nature deficit disorder
5598092 you know im going to get a t shirt that says who knew
5598093 louv said last week from his home in san diego
5598094 i knew it would touch a button but i didnt know it would be this big
5598095 its one thing for people to say how true or isnt this awful but its another thing for people across the country and internationally to work toward reconnecting with nature
5598096 think of all the things we complain about and do nothing about
5598097 she said i felt as if they had cut down a part of me and i dont think that little girl was speaking metaphorically
5598098 she was speaking about a part of her humanity of who we are
5598099 so when we take nature away its no small thing its cutting away children and ourselves
5598100 were keeping ontarios roads and families safe from vehicles used by people who repeatedly choose to drink and drive
5598101 this new law is a message to drunk drivers stop your irresponsible behaviour or you could lose your wheels
5598102 it will be another avenue for front line officers to assess
5598103 drinking and driving gets more attention during the winter yet we arrest more impaired drivers in the summer months
5598104 were very happy to see this happen it sends a clear message to the public that drinking and driving will not be tolerated
5598105 its one more brick in the construction of a nanny state
5598106 were not changing the world but we may get people to think
5598107 the city had an opportunity to expand recycling outside the home something other municipal leaders are doing but instead it ignored the facts and decided to target a healthy consumer choice
5598108 this is a move that will cost taxpayers more and do less for the environment
5598109 most families are not going to encourage their children to lap up water from public fountains
5598110 i downloaded but i just look at it and delete

5598116 hes making tremendous strides hes come in and grasped this scheme like no other
5598117 if you look at him back there and you listen to him make his checks hes so confident you just have a lot of confidence in him as a linebacker taking the call from him hes been putting the work in and he knows what hes doing
5598118 i had to slow down because i was used to going up against these fast receivers
5598119 now im on tight ends where i have to slow down because i have more speed than those guys so i can be there to make a play on the ball
5598120 im a carolina panther and im going to play as hard as i can for the carolina panthers
5598121 if we do present ourselves to the texans theyre going to get every bit of me
5598122 the sidewalk dining issue is a fly on the back of an elephant
5598123 we need to be aware as our downtown becomes more successful that the crowds are going to get larger we ought to take a hard look at where we should go
5598124 the most prevalent threat to public safety in center city is the combination of overcrowding and over intoxication
5598125 when you mix in people drinking pretty heavily and the cruisers going by and no space out on the sidewalk the situation is set up for one thing to go bad
5598126 before you know it youve got a fight with 10 people involved
5598127 if weve got a problem down there its not 100 people eating dinner
5598128 we want to be the ones that knock them off
5598129 were putting that up as the challenge to our kids
5598130 we didnt know how fast we could progress with our stuff

5598141 we have our ideas on how we want it set up but then we dont do this for a living

5598143 people shouldnt be surprised that guys are going to shoot low numbers with greens this nice
5598144 theres only so much we can do this time of year
5598145 i think it was a nice change coming to greensboro

5598250 as they ridiculed me they took delight most in mocking letters i had received from readers in england i had now been without food and water and the toilet for 12 hours and having been made to stand my legs buckled i vomited and passed out all i remember is one of them gouging scraping and clawing with his nails at the tender flesh beneath my eyes he scooped my head and dug his fingers in near the auditory nerves between my head and eardrum the pain became sharper as he dug in two fingers at a time another man had his combat boot on my neck pressing into the hard floor i lay there for over an hour the room became a menagerie of pain sound and terror
5598251 beatings painful binding back bending body stretching and prolonged sleep deprivation
5598252 this is by no means an isolated incident but part of a long term strategy to demolish palestinian social economic and cultural life i am aware of the possibility that mohammed omer might be murdered by israeli snipers or bomb attack in the near future
5598253 i arrived with others at the israeli immigration terminal at allenby around 9 50 am entering with the others on my transport through luggage collection and security screening which leads into the holding area for passport control as i stood in line to approach the passport agents i believed everything to be okay and that id soon be home in gaza at this point a female israeli soldier approached me and asked where are you from i replied gaza she asked where is that and i answered in hebrew azzah she nodded stating oh yes before pausing and adding actually according to my computer you dont have an entry permit pointing to the rows of chairs facing the passport agents she motioned me to have a seat and told me someone would call my name one hour and a half later my name still had not been called i watched as people with american and european passports easily traversed passport control and questioning as well as the vip club members who simply show passports and pass i continued to wait i was called by a blond haired man with green eyes a shin bet agent hereafter referred to by the israeli acronym shabak the internal israeli intelligence division similar to the fbi or mi 5 in the us or britain in hebrew he asked efo mokhammed he asked me to come to him and then asked where my bags were i pointed to the holding area with my luggage two pieces an overnight backpack and a medium size suitcase he asked if i brought anything illegal with me and responded of course not the blond shabak then asked for my cell phone telling me to turn it off and remove the battery i asked if i could make a phone call quickly to let my dutch embassy escort who was waiting on the other side of the terminal know what was happening the shabak replied forcefully no you cant this was my first indication this delay was not routine had it been there would have been no issue with me informing my diplomatic escort of the situation note absent a watch wall clock or mobile phone times can only be approximated from this point forward i removed the battery from the cell phone as i have been asked and placed my luggage on the two metal tables as requested he then asked me to leave my belongings and follow him i recognized we were entering the shin bet offices at allenby upon entering he motioned for me to sit in a chair within a closed corridor i could see nothing beyond the walls only the cameras above my head watching me after what seemed to be one hour and thirty minutes both doors at the end of the corridor opened i watched as one of the palestinian passengers exited securing his belt to his trousers a second man followed behind and was struggling to put on his t shirt immediately i realized i was not in a good place the rooms from which they exited must be used for strip searching suddenly i became nervous but stayed calm with all the soldiers a uniformed shabak officer with police clothes referred to as avi by his co workers told me to come with him my luggage had been brought and he proceeded to empty each of all contents manually checking every item from underwear to the gifts of perfume id purchased for friends and family he then tossed the gifts to the other side of the table shortly thereafter a well built muscular blond man in his forties joined avi while green eyes from earlier entered the room to supervise green eyes began what soon became apparent to me to be an interrogation what is this he says pointing to what is obviously clothing what is this what is this he continues to pepper in elementary english as each item is removed from my luggage avi now moves to my backpack overnight bag containing my documents letters from readers throughout europe copies of e mails my articles my journalist notebooks and the business cards of members of parliament in greece and sweden as well as those of members in the house of commons in england in addition to cards from various business people i met throughout europe all of my records contacts and correspondence of my 3 week trip not to mention all of my notes for future stories the intelligence orders examined they then collected all of my documents and dumped them into a blue box adding my cell phone and the memory cards storing all of the photographs from my trip and the presentations i made to the governments of the netherlands france sweden greece and in the united kingdom they were looking for something specific but i wouldnt know what until green eyes demanded where is the money mohammed what money i thought of course i had money on me i was traveling confused i replied i had some money from various nations but not much he commanded i place all currency on the table which i did it amounted to the equivalent of about four hundred pounds roughly 800 usd for a moment i was relieved thinking this was just a typical shakedown id lose the cash with me but that would be about it however my traveling money failed to suffice dissatisfied he pressed where is the english pound and how much you have i realized he was after the award stipend for the martha gellhorn prize from the uk and i told him i did not have it with me id arranged for a bank transfer rather than carry it with me visibly irritated the intelligence agent continued to press for money around me its filled with hall room filled with more intelligence officers bringing the total israeli personnel most well armed in the room to eight eight israelis and me at this point i realized this wasnt a simple shakedown dissatisfied that larger sums of money failed to materialize green eyes accused me of lying i again repeated the prize money went to bank draft and i already had shown him all the cash i had on me avi interjected ordering me to empty my pockets which i already had seeing they had tapped out he escorted me into another room this one empty ok take off your clothes avi the intelligence officer ordered i asked why a simple pat down would have disclosed any money belts or weapons besides i had already gone through an x ray machine before entering the passport holding area removing all but my underwear i stood before avi in an increasingly belligerent tone he ordered take off everything i am not taking off my underwear i stated again he ordered me to remove my underwear at this point i informed him that an escort from the dutch embassy was currently waiting for me on the other side of the interrogation center and that i was under diplomatic transit he replied he knew that thus indicating he didnt care and again insisted i strip again i refused there was no reason for me to do so at this point he placed his hand on his hip revolver and i became quite frightened tears welled in my eyes and i began crying why are you treating me this way i asked attempting to maintain my composure i am human being for a moment i flashed on the scene in the oscar winning film the pianist where the jewish man being humiliated by a nazi quoted shakespeare invoking his faith in place of written words doth a jew not have eyes the old man queried attempting to appeal to the humanity buried somewhere in the soul of his oppressor finding myself confronting the same racism and disdain i wanted to ask avi doth a palestinian not have eyes like the nazi would his indoctrination inoculate him from empathy as well likely i reasoned it would avi smirked half chuckling as he informed me this is nothing compared to what you will see now with that the intelligence officer unholstered his weapon pressing it to my head and with his full body weight pinning me on my side he forcibly removed my underwear completely naked i stood before him as he proceeded to feel me up one side and down the other he knew i had nothing on the x ray would have shown such and once people pass through the first security check no one is allowed to leave the area even to go have a smoke get food or drink avi then proceeded to demand i do a concocted sort of dance ordering me to move to the right and the side when i refused he forced me under his own power to move side to side terrified now i started to cry backing off he ordered me to get dressed and follow him returning to the room with my luggage the blond intelligence officer initiated a discreet form of psyops as he proceeded to dissect my belongings you are a crazy man he said nonchalantly shaking his head side to side signifying disgust is there anyone who is gazan who would go to france see paris and then come back to gaza where there is no food no fuel no clean water where there is darkness as he spoke his tone dispensed words in slices of condescension or do you like to be around the hamas system in gaza
5598254 we are the palestinian red crescent ambulance he told me we were called by israeli soldiers to pick up your body and get you to a hospital he said around 1 30 or so as i guess behind him an israeli soldier approached the ambulance insisting the emts emergency medical technicians would not be permitted to move me until i signed a paper first of all anything signed by a person incapacitated cannot be binding thou this is a technicality often expunged from israeli protocol fortunately people were looking out for me the driver asked the soldier what kind of paper and the soldier explained that it would indemnify the israelis should anything happen once i was transferred into palestinian custody in other words if i died or was permanently disabled as a result of israels actions israel could not be held accountable one would think i was in a third world dictatorship rather than the only democracy in the middle east one would think thou i could not see him i recognized the voice of the soldier as avi the emt replied hes unconscious you cant make him sign something he cannot read and we dont know yet what you did to him during the interrogation

5598349 looking for a world where danger lurks around every corner where mates mean three werewolves taking on the world together and where the men love their girls as much as they do each other look no farther than the mates anthology julia talbot presents fur and phobias a story about a sweet girl named abby with a terrible fear of dogs aaron thinks he might just be the one to cure her but he and his lover lee have a secret that may send abby running for the hills can they work together to ease abbys fears in sean michaels running with the wolf a roving pack of werewolves have made terrible trouble for artist vicki whos been bitten and has no idea what to do about it swan and dibs know what to do though and the two boys are determined to help vicki whether she wants it or not can they show her what its like to run with the wolf finally ba tortuga presents for life jamie and brett both know something terrible is about to happen to melody and they come back into her life after years spent apart turning her carefully ordered world upside down someone is determined to make them pay for a mistake from the past but these three are older and wiser now can they find a way to stay together
5598350 libertarians hate the government and love a good fight they are absolutely the best friends you can have
5598351 sudans anti terrorism special courts are nothing but a travesty of justice
5598352 some of the people sentenced yesterday only met their lawyers for the first time during the trial while several said they suffered torture when they were held incommunicado and that they were forced to confess to crimes
5598353 those trials were clearly unfair and now sudan is preparing to try yet more people with this system how is that justice
5598354 marks of ill treatment were still clearly visible on their bodies
5598355 the sudanese government has the duty to investigate crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice but they must do it in accordance to international law and their own constitution which guarantees fair trials
5598356 we urge the sudanese authorities not to execute these men and to review their cases immediately according to sudans laws
5598357 the whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves but wiser people so full of doubts
5598358 what you would desire others to do for you you should do for others you should respect others as you want to be respected by them
5598359 i think it would be a benefit for the public to know when the committee is meeting and to be able to see the information as the committee meets that ultimately will be presented in a report
5598360 it was actually my second mri it was a follow up from a biopsy i had had last year

5598371 io e frank storia di unamicizia con il mio personaggio
5598372 io credo che frank bascombe sia solo e soltanto la somma di tutti i suoi attributi toglierne uno qualsiasi lo snaturerebbe questo vero anche per tutti noi ossia anche per chi una persona vera e non un personaggio fittizio ma vero in particolare per i personaggi dei romanzi che non hanno tratti nascosti anime attitudini e spiriti al di fuori di quelli che noi scrittori diamo loro se c una caratteristica di frank che spesso viene trascurata ma che fondamentale per il suo personaggio la sincerit se frank avesse una sua natura elementare sarebbe questa la sincerit frank tutto sommato un personaggio che non ironico anche se ogni tanto fa dellironia e il lettore pu cogliere pi di una volta una discrepanza tra ci che frank dice e ci che intende davvero dire lironia una componente importante della vita di ognuno o almeno delle vite che vale la pena raccontare per frank tutto sommato un uomo trasparente mentre lironia quando si attacca ad un personaggo una specie di schermo ingannevole se sono riuscito nel mio lavoro di scrittore attraverso la trasparenza di frank puoi scorgere la sua vulnerabilit i suoi sentimenti e il suo mondo interiore strani e indefinibili colori dellanima che possono risuonare insieme allo spirito dei lettori per portarli vincendo la loro naturale diffidenza nelluniverso del romanzo se non sono riuscito in ci che mi propongo invece dalle trasparenze di frank potrai scorgere solo unanima di carta e un mucchio di righe scritte che sono la trasfigurazione delle ore che ho passato dannandomi sul romanzo se il lettore non concorda con me sulla rilevanza di ci che il personaggio fa o dice se il lettore non accetta o condivide il legame che io stabilisco come autore tra le azioni di frank e le loro conseguenze allora sento di aver fallito nel mio intento artistico per facilitare questo patto tacito tra me e il lettore io scelgo di rinunciare a doppi significati simbolismi allegorie e altre forme di mistificazione letteraria io racconto frank cos come poi il lettore pu farne ci che vuole e attribuirgli significati che io non avevo previsto purch non siano troppo dissonanti con la natura di frank potrei sentire di aver perso il controllo sul personaggio se il lettore percepisse frank come un mostro o come qualcosa di molto differente da ci che ho scritto ma se ci accade voglio essere libero di dare la colpa al lettore e per permettermi questa licenza devo prima essermi impegnato al massimo nel creare un personaggio sincero senza lati nascosti
5598373 satisfaction leads to consumer spending and consumer spending is about two thirds of the economy
5598374 if you have unhappy customers in the aggregate they are going to be less likely to want to repeat the experience of buying in the situation we are in today you want to encourage spending
5598375 not only did they improve but in apples case it is 10 points ahead of its closest competition and google is about the same
5598376 they are all windows based and we all know there were some significant problems with vista
5598377 i dont think its possible for apple to have a lead as big as this for long the other companies will retool a bit and come back
5598378 its usually the highest scoring automobile so it can increase its price when everyone else is going down because the companys value proposition is solid
5598379 as soon as you have the element of service in there it tends to get a little dicey for those companies to do that well is impressive i wish detroit would look at this

5598384 i feel like ive got certain talents and i use them to the best of my ability
5598385 a horrible history of marginalizing and freak a fying and a racist history but the coney island sideshow cost a dollar to get in and people went who would never go to the theater who would never see a post modern expos on gender it was a great part for me i would turn the thing upside down and go into a feminist rant and juggle knifes but there was always a banner on the outside that said bearded lady and that i hated that i was part of the freak show
5598386 im she im comfortable with she pronoun i can choose we all know whats comfortable gender god knows i dont know what that means anymore im sort of pondering my own internal sense of self in relation to my presentation although i am a woman with a beard i dont really identify as trans i see that i transgress traditional gender signifiers but i think the relationship of my beard to my gender identity is minimal
5598387 i identify as a director a performer a teacher why would i prioritize age over gender over race over class over the thing that i do over the color that i like over the food that i eat
5598388 its a one ring no animal political queerly situated free circus extravaganza
5598389 each year we have a different social justice political theme and then the gender is always nicely mixed up all over the place and broadly framed this year were talking about predatory lending and the mortgage crisis and the racist history of credit exploitation and were also talking about the particle accelerator
5598390 because they straddle gender boundaries so its mysterious and confounding people want to feel strong enough to be who they are to not be compromised by secrets they feel they have to keep they wish for the relief of not having to live up to images they cant live up to but that were all stuck with
5598391 bearded women have no fewer problems i might have come to terms with my beard but coming to terms with weight or coming to terms with aging theyre still there
5598392 certainly in the externalized in the interactive parts of our experiences we share an immense amount
5598393 who wants to walk into a bathroom and hear women shriek
5598394 its not that i care that women get upset i just dont want to deal with their eruptions its just easier i pass in the mens bathroom but if im in a comfortable place where im known like the pratt where i teach i use the womens bathroom but if im at the airport i slip right into the mens room im just sort of interested in going to the bathroom

5598407 a large section of supporters of english soccer fans were in raptures as last season ended the premier league trophy was not decided until the final day of the season and then the top two english clubs contested the champions league final but this was not the only reason to be joyful most supporters regardless of their favourite team could sense a change was to come next season
5598408 fans hoped they would no longer have to put up with the theatrics of cristiano ronaldo or didier drogba nor the constantly dramatic frank lampard who always looks to the sky as the summer passed by and each transfer remained incomplete supporters gradually became more and more agitated we sensed a shift in the institute and examined it further
5598409 as august came upon us many supporters had yet to renew their sky sports subscriptions very few had bothered with a fantasy football team and in some extreme circumstances some of the hardest hit had not even checked paddy powers odds for the upcoming season
5598410 fans hoped to have a less infuriating season but alas they will have to suffer another season of ronaldos faux tears and aversion to passing drogbas swan diving and lampard wobbling around the outside of the box and scoring goals with deflections the supporters are very upset
5598411 do your job from the first time and do it right
5598412 holy father protect them by the power of your name the name you gave me so that they may be one as we are one
5598413 all the believers were together and had everything in common selling their possessions and goods they gave to anyone as he had need every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts they broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts
5598414 then jesus said to the crowds and to is disciples the teachers of the law and the pharisees sit in moses seat so you must obey them and do everything they tell you but do not do what they do for they do not practice what they preach they tie up heavy loads and put them on mens shoulders but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them everything they do is done for men to see they make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them rabbi teacher but you are not to be called rabbi teacher for you have only one master and you are all brothers and do not call anyone on earth father for you have one father and he is in heaven nor are you to be called teacher for you have one teacher the christ the greatest among you wil be your servant for whoever exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted
5598415 no one wants us to be seen as a cowtown so we just decided to embrace that
5598416 i wish people would love everybody else the way they love me it would be a better world
5598417 ecuador is still under the spell of gloom that befell about two years ago i saw it one year before that but i did not know what to do about it and i did not want to believe it either
5598418 now the opposite has happened there is a small light showing at the end of the tunnel it is small but steady god bless it we must not talk about it too much it is called manta
5598419 manta did not exist in colonial times the pirates and sea robbers made it unthinkable to have a port facing the ocean the nearest port had to be thirty miles in at least
5598420 i was in manta i had not been there for ten years at least it has improved a lot in that time
5598421 this is all very complicated i hope it works for the best unfortunately it brings us close to our president and that is not what we want we want to keep him away
5598422 they are however much better organized and have clearer objectives and words than they had say fifteen years ago of course they still need another time to be at par as an ethnic group it will come if you give them time fortunately
5598423 the unfortunate part is that it is all taking place at a moment when their negativity can cause a lot of damage they also say down with dollarization
5598424 the new president he is my personal friend a great guy but not the right man for the crisis as he is too flat footed everything the previous man has done is wrong
5598425 we had quite a recent scare during the past several months the people of ecuador had become increasingly infuriated with the presidents conduct of governmental affairs
5598426 we had a situation where very little support was given either to president or to this military insurrects a constitutional solution had to be applied
5598427 as much as i believe the president to be corrupt and incompetent i was deeply angered and saddened by the whole situation
5598428 the bottom line is that there was some sort of democratic solution to the crisis the country is calming down there is this bitter feeling about the whole situation but who knows maybe it was for the best
5598429 the international community represented by the different states has manifested its approval of this constitutional solution to the crisis and is currently supporting ecuador at least rhetorically in its struggle to shape up
5598430 the new president is regarded to be a good honest man he has changed most of the different ministers and secretaries of the government and it is likely we are somehow facing a fresh start maybe its a little bit of wishful thinking on my part
5598431 these past days we have seen a very good attitude in most of the industrial sector the have committed to lower some prices and to raise the wages somehow a feeling of responsibility and that we are all part of the solution is surfacing i sure hope so
5598432 the crisis is very deep and we still have some rough years ahead i would want to believe that we have nowhere else to go from here but up
5598433 i think after this episode the country is going to try and move forward with more enthusiasm and drive
5598434 this new president may do a much better job than the last one
5598435 the country is well aware of this and there is some sense of peace after all
5598436 i understand many foreign investors may view ecuador as an anarchic country which is falling apart by the day where their investments are in no way safe this is not true
5598437 in this crisis many good investment opportunities exist real estate for example offers very nice investment opportunities this kind of investments are of course better on the mid to long term
5598438 when the better times arrive hopefully some two to three years from now and then on and on as exports grow and the economy improves the new flows of cash and the economic recovery and good health will make it more difficult to find good deals on certain areas this may be a signal to buy now
5598439 the last president seemed to be a better man but he had done too many dirty deals with the political and specially the financial sector to be trustworthy
5598440 i do however believe that the president will face huge demonstrations again this summer when they will have to increase the prices of gas propane electricity etc
5598441 i appreciate dear friend that the international news are very alarming but the reality is very different since here in ecuador everything follows with tranquillity and in the direction of the improvement of abundance and peace

5598501 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5598502 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5598503 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5598504 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5598505 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5598506 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5598507 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5598508 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5598509 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5598510 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5598511 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5598512 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5598513 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5598514 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5598515 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5598516 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5598517 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5598518 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5598519 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5598520 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5598521 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5598522 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5598523 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5598524 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5598525 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5598526 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5598527 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5598528 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5598529 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5598530 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5598531 why are you ordering a salad when this place is known for their burgers
5598532 its easier for me to eat better now than regret it later
5598533 my stomach will make me pay later if i eat a greasy burger
5598534 oh jen cant eat that because shes on a diet
5598535 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5598536 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5598537 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5598538 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5598539 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5598540 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5598541 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5598542 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5598543 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5598544 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5598545 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5598546 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5598547 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5598548 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5598549 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5598550 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5598551 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5598552 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5598553 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5598554 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5598555 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5598556 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5598557 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5598558 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5598559 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

5598570 the madison is a conventional race with riders in each team riding part of the distance handing over to the other member resting and then returning to the race teams are usually of two riders but occasionally of three only one of the team is racing at any time and the replacement rider has to be touched before he can take over the touch can also be a push often on the shorts or one rider hurling the other into the race by a handsling how long each rider stays in the race is for each team to decide originally riders took stints of a couple of hours or more and the resting rider went off for a sleep or a meal that was easier in earlier six day races because hours could pass without riders attempting to speed away from the others as races became more intensive so both riders from the team began riding on the track at the same time one going fast on the short line around the bottom of the track and the other idling higher up until his turn comes to take over modern six days last less than 12 hours a day and the madison is now only a featured part so staying on the track throughout is more feasible the aim of each team is to ride more laps than any of the others tied positions are split by points awarded for placings at a series of sprints at intervals during the race the madison is a feature of six day races but it can also be a separate race as in the olympic games it has its own championships and specialist riders a madison typically lasts between 30 and 60 minutes
5598571 this race is a 50 kilometre 200 lap race cyclists compete in pairs with one resting as the other rides placing was determined first by laps then by points points were awarded based on intermediate sprints held every 20 laps the first finisher in each sprint earns 5 points the second gets 3 the third finisher earns 2 and the fourth place cyclist after each sprint gets 1 point
5598572 teams consisting of two riders will compete in a race run over a distance of 50km 200 laps with intermediate sprints the final placing will be determined by the accumulated points in the sprints which occur every 20 laps or by the distance according to the complete laps covered by each team teams having covered the same number of laps will be placed according to their accumulated points where there is a draw on laps and points the place during the final sprint shall decide the final result sprint points will be awarded as follows 5 points to the first team 3 points to the second 2 points to the third and 1 point to the fourth

5598606 iguodala is a major and integral part of our team
5598607 he is not replaceable the way the league works and the collective bargaining agreement works this man was not replaceable iguodalas option was to play for the qualifying offer and then become an unrestricted free agent
5598608 we didnt want to even get to that we wanted to make a deal so that wed have him for the long term
5598609 we made a commitment to the city and to our fans that we were going for an nba championship when we signed elton brand

5598621 everywhere we go here we meet gay amp lesbian activists receive their news letters or read about their many events many seem to be supported by north american churches
5598622 i see a great wall being put up by revisionists against those orthodox who believe in the authority of scripture
5598623 the revisionists among us push upon us the view that current secular culture and not the bible should shape our mission and morals in this we are not divided by mere trivialities or issues on the periphery of faith but on essentials i am shocked to say that we are finding it very hard to come together on even the essentials of the faith we once received from the apostles
5598624 learn three chords on the guitar and go write a tune

5598633 its not partying all the time sometimes when i get the chance i am too tired to party people dont see the work that goes in to touring but its definitely worth it

5598648 the initial story when it broke in the townsville bulletin reading that as a local person i was cringing with embarrassment

5598650 youve got mayor molony being supported by the likes of bob katter who is stating that we wear as a badge of honour the description of redneck

5598653 i believe that people should have the right to vote on issues that are fairly and honestly placed before them

5598660 broad is sort of saying that for self managed artists who dont have the backing of record companies theres a whole bunch of stuff you can do on your own
5598661 when i was at school everything i did was to do with plays
5598662 but then the record company came and said you know what no one cares if do re mi put out a third album but we would really like a solo album from deborah
5598663 i didnt want to make a solo record and i had nothing to say
5598664 crappy really awful but it was good in the sense that it was a big learning curve and gave me the impetus to find my own songwriting voice
5598665 so i went away and had a think with willy about the kinds of acts we would invite and the kinds of venues we would use but the producer then decided that it was too impractical and financially not viable so we moved on
5598666 the idea that i would pull these different women performers together from different genres and call it
5598667 i freaked out but then i thought well goddamn it im now a promoter so i booked other venues in canberra and adelaide and pushed ahead

5598671 the screening for hla b 5701 prior to abacavir treatment allows the identification of patients likely to develop hsr using hla b 5701 tests as a companion diagnostic with the drug abacavir therefore helps to better protect hiv infected patients in treatment from severe additional suffering
5598672 the combination of diagnostics and therapeutics is a key approach to eliminating risks of side effects and therefore increasing the efficacy of drugs
5598673 carbamazepine for instance which is prescribed for treatment of epilepsy is more likely to cause dangerous or even fatal skin reaction in asian patients carrying the hla b 1502 allele
5598674 our new test is another great example for the advent of molecular diagnostic tests which can be used to assess the efficacy of drugs this trend holds great promises for the future enabling doctors to customize therapies based on molecular tests which create molecular profiles of patients or diseases ultimately leads to more medical innovation cost efficiency and most importantly to better and safer treatment of patients
5598675 so far we have only seen the tip of the pharmacogenomic and companion diagnostic icebergs at qiagen we are proud of the roles that our sample and assay technologies and molecular diagnostics franchise contribute to bringing the vision of personalized medicine to reality

5598684 sometimes the parents are concerned about where the kids are going after school

5598909 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5598910 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5598911 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5598912 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5598913 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5598914 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5598915 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5598916 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5598917 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5598918 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5598919 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5598920 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5598921 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5598922 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5598923 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5598924 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5598925 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5598926 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5598927 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5598928 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5598929 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5598930 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5598931 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5598932 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5598933 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5598934 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5598935 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5598936 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5598937 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5598938 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5598939 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5598940 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5598941 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5598942 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5598943 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5598944 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5598945 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5598946 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5598947 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again

5598954 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5598955 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5598956 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5598957 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5598958 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5598959 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5598960 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5598961 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5598962 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5598963 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5598964 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5598965 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5598966 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5598967 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5598968 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5598969 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5598970 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5598971 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5598972 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5598973 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5598974 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5598975 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5598976 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5598977 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5598978 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5598979 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5598980 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5598981 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5598982 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5598983 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5598984 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5598985 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5598986 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5598987 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5598988 obviously the quality of the ingredients is important but i think less is best
5598989 you feel the taste of the sauce and then just drops of other ingredients and thats what other people appreciate

5599010 we have fulfilled expectations and further increased our profits even in a highly volatile market situation we are optimistic about the year as a whole and are expecting a very good result

5599014 the outlook is not good but we are giving the calf its only option
5599015 our vision for robbie is that at the moment hes the number two ruckman at fremantle and there is an opportunity for him to come and play ruck for not only us but all of the other clubs that are speaking to him
5599016 no robbies had a shoulder reconstruction so hes not playing
5599017 robbies a required player and in the end that will be his decision about what he wants to do
5599018 picking her would have a groundswell impact on democrats but not picking her will leave her to have a new role leading on her issues and supporting barack for president
5599019 it used to be sort of expected that there was a phase of life where you had children and a lot of women arent doing that now
5599020 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5599021 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5599022 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5599023 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5599024 if you remove a school bus from the road youre adding 40 to 50 cars in the morning and in the afternoon
5599025 are you going to walk a half mile down the street to cross in the appropriate way when you see a clear way right there
5599026 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5599027 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5599028 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5599029 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5599030 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5599031 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5599032 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5599033 i think this is a magic time for people to get behind the anti tobacco work
5599034 it will be a tough fight and a long term fight but a very important one
5599035 its not a surprise they tried thats the tendency around the world
5599036 i think the reason is they want to show they think smoking is very nice some people are maybe stressful like me
5599037 in china theres a real tradition of men giving cigarettes to each other at social gatherings
5599038 everybody is offering cigarettes to everybody else and nobody feels they can refuse them
5599039 were trying to tell people when theyre giving cigarettes theyre giving a cancer causing substance
5599040 would do a lot to persuade people that it wasnt such a beautiful gift
5599041 you can also become our hero to protect our loved ones please smoke outside
5599042 its a crisis of leadership a crisis of strategy and a crisis of what the future looks like for the supermajors
5599043 they are like a deer caught in headlights they know they have to move but they cant decide where to go
5599044 there is still a lot of oil to develop out there which is why we dont call this geological peak oil especially in places like venezuela russia iran and iraq
5599045 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5599046 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5599047 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5599048 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5599049 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5599050 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5599051 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5599052 europe will be divided again the lines are different pushed farther east but the division is the same and dangerous
5599053 there is a split and there is some confusion among these members
5599054 european unification has never solved one essential problem the problem of its surroundings
5599055 france has basically said we want to deal with russia and we can deal with russia power to power its an attitude of global balance
5599056 the polish position is quite different they are saying we want some protection and we want the americans on our side they are far away they can protect us but not control us
5599057 the asaish are saying they will annex kirkuk by force and that is terrifying people
5599058 the war within a secret white house history 2006 2008
5599059 there has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the nixon tapes and the pentagon papers
5599060 this is the declassification of what went on in secret behind the scenes
5599061 takes readers deep inside the white house the pentagon the state department the intelligence agencies and the u s military headquarters in iraq
5599062 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5599063 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5599064 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5599065 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5599066 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5599067 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5599068 we just want to make sure its not a problem
5599069 you murdered my mother and tried to murder my niece you caused this family nothing but pain and devastation
5599070 there was no whirring glass bubble like maxwell smart or something like that
5599071 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5599072 unless and until there is more of a focus on military leadership reform then reform of these intelligence agencies isnt going to go anywhere
5599073 the politicians have nothing to do with controlling the system of nuclear assets in pakistan
5599074 right now it is under the army establishment and it will remain under the army establishment i dont think there is any threat
5599075 i am leaving with satisfaction that whatever i could do for this country i did that with honesty
5599076 i am a human too i could have made mistakes i believe that the people will forgive me and if there were any shortcomings or any mistakes they were unintentional
5599077 musharraf should not be given a safe way out of the country
5599078 to give them haircuts and make them all spiffed up for the democratic national convention because they are part of our community as well
5599079 i wanted to look good for nancy and now i do
5599080 im looking for a job interview and a job and to get off the homeless streets of denver
5599081 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5599082 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5599083 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5599084 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5599085 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5599086 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5599087 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5599088 we say join the club it makes us feel old too
5599089 but if youve got a certain degree of wisdom and your body hasnt fallen apart yet you may be at the best time of your life
5599090 because its venting properly itll maintain a temperature that will reduce the risk of explosion
5599091 the girls started at the school 8 years ago as complete beginners what they have achieved since then is remarkable and testament to their talent and dedication passing their teachers exam with such high marks is the icing on the cake and has made me very proud
5599092 most schools never receive a scholarship nomination so to receive 6 from the same class was amazing
5599093 genio quiero poder entrar en la cabeza de un hombre malvado de verdad
5599094 si yo act o a trav s de l como un hijo de puta podr comprender en su plenitud qu se siente y qu le lleva a actuar as
5599095 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always
5599096 people who visit these sites leave a trail and we will follow it and find them
5599097 i hope this result acts as a deterrent and sends out a clear warning that such activity will not be tolerated
5599098 he has not sought to minimise his behaviour he has been entirely candid and has demonstrated a genuine desire to change his ways
5599099 he realises that the way he thinks is wrong and totally inappropriate and everyone is rightly disgusted by it he wants to put it behind him and deal with some of the issues that have led him to think this way
5599100 he is a young man who has fallen into the category of the sad and lonely teenager who spends far too long in a dark and lonely room in front of a computer screen and has not had the life experiences to gain maturity
5599101 it may be many years after that before you are released
5599102 prepared to go to extreme lengths to feed your lust
5599103 i consider that you pose a very significant risk to the public
5599104 i consider that you are a dangerous offender and i think the public need protecting from you for an extended period of time
5599105 as you can imagine the execution of the investigation trying to find the cause is going to take some time
5599106 i spoke to them at the scene earlier and they are still investigating
5599107 fire service investigators are taking the lead on the inquiry
5599108 the woolworths store in darlington is currently closed for health and safety reasons
5599109 safety is our priority and we are doing everything we possibly can to ensure the store can reopen for business as soon as possible
5599110 hopefully being in the olympics will bring bmx out of the little kid stage because everyone thinks its just a kiddie sport with little kiddie bikes
5599111 if youre in the olympics youre an athlete at the top of your sport
5599112 there are some drawbacks to having a rather unconventional first name he says hes been detained briefly several times when arriving in the united states because such an unusual name tends to raise more than a few eyebrows with u s customs and border patrol officials
5599113 hes just as crazy off the track as he is on it
5599114 id actually pay to buy a ticket for that one
5599115 david robinson and karl malone and that was the frontcourt
5599116 who else was up there patrick ewing so patrick david and karl malone that would be interesting
5599117 and i would say the 2008 olympics really demonstrate that complete embrace
5599118 stern said he never imagined the nba china relationship that began in 1985 would be as popular as it is at the beijing games
5599119 you know i didnt even dare to think about that
5599120 the question was one step at a time if youve been along on the journey sometimes you dont realize how far youve come
5599121 stern said the league does not see china as an entry point to asia india could be next on the nbas radar
5599122 that would be a separate league that would be nba affiliated or nba sponsored but it would be independent
5599123 and it would just sign players for a very long time to come it would be at a lower scale than the nba but as the sport develops in china and as more players around the world recognize the opportunities of playing in china we see that league growing and strengthening
5599124 i think that that is likely to become a regular thing
5599125 coming out of athens there was just more of a focus at every level on the game and the representation of ones country and were just doing a better job collectively on that front
5599126 he was integral he played a key role he was trusted by other members of this site so much so that he stored horrific images of child abuse on their behalf
5599127 he described the 250 000 child abuse images as his collection he was prepared to share that with acquaintances he found on his forum
5599128 this site would have existed without him but it would not have been operating as effectively
5599129 the combined undercover operation was of the type never seen before
5599130 there were more police undercover assets co ordinated through ceop that in any other investigation in respect of child abuse in this country
5599131 it is the first of its kind but it is not the last
5599132 we were able to go further to dig deeper and identify patterns of behaviour and the evidence to hold these individuals to account more effectively
5599133 it is not rhetoric when we say to predators that wherever you go you leave a digital footprint and we will take you down
5599134 there is a forensic trail left in the electronic environment like no other we will continue to pursue you until we find you
5599135 if you are all powerful and good why didnt you protect my daughter
5599136 most roads dont lead anywhere what it does mean is that i will travel any road to find you
5599137 id actually pay to buy a ticket for that one
5599138 david robinson and karl malone and that was the frontcourt
5599139 who else was up there patrick ewing so patrick david and karl malone that would be interesting
5599140 the world is embracing the sport that the dream teamers brought to barcelona
5599141 and i would say the 2008 olympics really demonstrate that complete embrace

5599160 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5599161 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5599162 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies

5599213 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship
5599214 russias attack on georgia is a disheartening reminder that the 21st century remains a primitive age of fanatical nationalism and military bullying
5599215 even more distressing is the fact that both russia and georgia are christian nations with ancient church roots
5599216 military intervention in georgia like all actions born of hatred or callous self interest is an act of madness a senseless rejection of gods love and salvation
5599217 political leaders in russia and georgia indeed in many other nations including our own seek to justify military interventions on the grounds of national interest or public security
5599218 in general the churches of christ reject such puerile political rationalizations
5599219 brutality in georgia is part of a world wide trend
5599220 that our country will learn the ways of peace and restore its reputation as a credible witness for restraint and nonviolence
5599221 war may at times be a necessary evil but it is inherently evil

5599226 authorities who resorted to the use of force are to be held accountable for the loss of life they have caused the well being of people who have fled their homes and of those whose homes have been destroyed must be a high priority in the coming days
5599227 the united nations must ensure the territorial integrity and political independence of georgia in accordance with the un charter and by collective action of the un security council
5599228 on the night of 8 august 2008 sorrow death and destruction came down upon the earth
5599229 we saw numerous innocent civilian victims we saw the destruction of populated areas and the infrastructure of south ossetia stop this immediately do not spill any more blood do not enlarge the present conflict
5599230 god and the holy virgin to stop the bloodshed so that our country as well as ossetia georgia the caucasus and the entire world could enjoy peace and prosperity
5599231 we are facing very serious peril but dont be afraid of anything god is with us and virgin mary is protecting is but one thing concerns us very deeply is that orthodox russians are bombing orthodox georgians
5599232 this is unprecedented act of relations between our countries reinforce your prayer and god will save georgia there is a saying water will flow up and down and will return to its weir so believe that god will not separate georgia into pieces
5599233 i have told representatives of the russian authorities several times that separatism is like a transmittable disease and everyone should remember this including russia
5599234 we have once again experienced care of georgia never ending humiliation insults slander terrorist acts and gunfire at civilians

5599255 so i called them and they were very scared they couldnt go out
5599256 its very stressful and every day its like calling home 2 000 times every day and trying to find out whats going on
5599257 they said several times that they are going to stop the fire but fire continues

5599265 i want to make it absolutely clear that sydney airport has no interest in seeing one of its runways not in full operation
5599266 there is no one more interested in seeing the runway safety area constructed and the airport quickly returned to normal operations than sydney airport itself

5599303 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5599304 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5599305 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction

5599330 all of these sites try to find a better way for users to navigate the web
5599331 based on not only satisfaction but also the volume numbers and the growth it looks as if google is continuing to stretch that lead
5599332 satisfaction is the best predictor on a go forward basis
5599333 satisfied consumers are going to come back be loyal and use these services more which in turn is going to generate more revenue for these companies
5599334 it gives them the expectation coming in that this is the way to search as long as google meets that expectation theyre going to do well
5599335 when you think about what we get out of search its just phenomenal how did we ever manage without it
5599336 on the other hand how many times do we go searching for something and we do not get where we want to go and we end up at a bunch of garbage sites

5599416 while we are pleased with the improvement in the pace of expenditures in the last two months we view the slight decline in revenues in july as a cause for concern which we hope to address in the coming months
5599417 overall revenue growth was down on a year on year basis but it was coming from a very very high base and there were some privatization receipts coming in last year
5599418 the one little bit of concern is tax revenues were up 8 0 percent year on year which is slightly soft the key thing is the government is spending so that should help to support growth
5599419 ngayon nakikita natin na kinakailangan na namang ipaglaban natin ang ating kalayaan laban sa kahirapan today we see that we again need to defend our freedom against poverty
5599420 bagamat kayo ay nasa magkabilang panig huwag nating kalimutan ang ating tungkulin at huwag isaalang alang ang ating tungkulin sana makita natin na kahit ibat ibang ahensya tayo sa pamahalaan kahit na nagaaway away tayo unahin pa rin natin ang kapakanan ng ating bansa while we may be on opposing sides let us not forget our duty and not make light of that duty may we see that even if we belong to different agencies in the government even if we quarrel the interest of our country comes first

5599429 if it is true that the milf leadership did not issue the order to attack the milf elements who pillaged some villages in lanao del norte should be pursued by the milf in coordination with government security forces
5599430 they should not allow their rogue members from destroying our gains in the peace process
5599431 im beginning to doubt if we are conducting peace talks with the right people
5599432 this defiance to the directives of their hierarchy is a sign that those who are behind the attacks have gone rogue and are no longer part of the milfs chain of command it also shows sign of weak leadership if the milf leaders cannot act to discipline their own members
5599433 if we can raise p100 000 from each mindanao congressman i think that this will go a long way to help the refugees

5599441 as president ill make our space program a priority again by devoting the attention and resources needed to not only inspire the world with feats of exploration but also improve life here on earth
5599442 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5599443 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of senator obama let me say just in case senator obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting nasa funding i oppose such cuts
5599444 i will ensure that space exploration remains a top priority and that the u s continues to lead the world in this field
5599445 jesuss agenda is far bigger than just one or two issues we have to care about poverty we have to care about disease we have to care about illiteracy we have to care about corruption in government sex trafficking
5599446 if obama ever establishes any kind of trust with evangelicals there will be a noticeable shift
5599447 it will not be huge but it will be significant
5599448 number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
5599449 the encouraging thing is that in 2004 we didnt have any part in the platform discussion
5599450 this time the party wanted us as a partner in the process they reached out to us and wanted to hear what we had to say
5599451 i was just in shock i couldnt believe they were using shredded up checks as packing material
5599452 weve been doing it so long we are all out of sorts about it because its so out of place for something like this to happen
5599453 that he knows of how does he know he doesnt have a particular customer who is doing this to get this information
5599454 very easy you look at the colors then you get the routing numbers and the bank information
5599455 we didnt piece any of this together we just taped it to hold it all together none of this is torn through at all
5599456 you get the wrong people getting this information they could have a hay day with one box a hay day and a shopping trip its scary
5599457 this will put nearly 50 000 young people at a competitive advantage and rightfully so
5599458 this 370 million is going to come out of the entire community including businesses
5599459 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned

5599467 the marketers have to say do i want an olympian who is in the spotlight every four years or may never be there again
5599468 it definitely propelled us on to be more marketable to the sponsors
5599469 i believe this officer did the best he could but unfortunately mistakes were made and we lacked confidence in the persuasiveness of our case
5599470 we still have a belief in eadys guilt which made for an agonizing decision
5599471 i expect that there will be shades of the truth told in a trial
5599472 but we rely on certain foundational things that someone is not going to tell a straight out lie this is very frustrating and disturbing
5599473 he was calm he was cool he appeared totally credible
5599474 he spoke right into the microphone and lied he didnt blink
5599475 no amount of chest pounding and assertions are going to make david friedrich into a liar

5599481 liu xiang our message to you is this we will forever be with you
5599482 from the american point of view we wildly mis estimated him and we wildly mis estimated pakistani capabilities
5599483 once the government gets this behind them maybe they can focus on counter terrorism and get back to the business of governing
5599484 the civilian government is pretty divided in how it views relations with the united states
5599485 musharraf for all his flaws was seen as somebody able to manage washingtons demands in pakistan the civilian leadership is seen as all too willing to make concessions to washington including some that in the eyes of the security establishment are untenable
5599486 i just dont think that one person especially given the condition he has been operating in for some time makes that much difference
5599487 that is an opportunity not a liability but it comes at a difficult time
5599488 strengthened its safe haven in pakistans federally administered tribal areas by deepening its alliances with pakistani militants

5599490 it ends an era marked by great cooperation but unfulfilled expectations
5599491 when i came up with the name hand held heart i realized that it wasnt always going to just be a record label
5599492 i thought that having a title or a moniker would be nice to have as the platform for anything i make whatever my interests are it falls under that
5599493 you really felt like you were a part of something important and you were involved and responsible in every aspect of your endeavors whether it was booking shows making t shirts or releasing records
5599494 its a very self reliant skill sharing community thats the primary quality that still influences my work and how i live my life today
5599495 identify the characteristics of a good tax system for any open developed economy in the 21st century
5599496 inheritance tax currently raises less than 4bn a year consideration could be given to abolishing it altogether
5599497 do es not advocate the introduction of a regular wealth tax
5599498 whether this move to the right in taxation attitudes will persist and to what extent it is now a fact of political life is hard to say
5599499 the term has recently been translated as good news that sounds attractive but it falls far short of the order of magnitude of what is actually meant by the word
5599500 when the evangelists adopt this word and it thereby becomes the generic name for their writings what they mean to tell us is this what the emperors who pretend to be gods illegitimately claim really occurs here a message endowed with plenary authority a message that is not just talk but reality

5599503 back in november we made some sdk builds available that we referred to as early look sdks the goal was to give developers insight into the platform as early on as possible and to get some initial feedback since then weve been working with our open handset alliance partners to incorporate much of that feedback and finish the first devices since those devices are shipping in the fourth quarter the platform is now converging on a final android 1 0 version
5599504 we have confirmed that the android device will be available for current t mobile customers online for pre sales on september 17th the pre sale will last for one week with the device being delivered on october 13th which happens to be the national public launch of the device
5599505 we dont want it to happen again and disrupt service
5599506 there is no foreclosure at the moment theres a notice thats been posted i dont really have any other comments there should be no real changes for the residents
5599507 i think it would be a benefit for the public to know when the committee is meeting and to be able to see the information as the committee meets that ultimately will be presented in a report

5599561 remain free to voice their objections religious or otherwise to the laws prohibition against sexual orientation discrimination
5599562 this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women
5599563 its a win for everyone because everyone could be the next target if doctors choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people

5599592 it didnt help the war he said and it didnt help the impression that the georgians overplayed their cards and miscalculated badly by moving to retake south ossetia on aug 7 which prompted the russian invasion

5599597 the main consideration was the national interest the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression

5599612 ngayon nakikita natin na kinakailangan na namang ipaglaban natin ang ating kalayaan laban sa kahirapan today we see that we again need to defend our freedom against poverty
5599613 bagamat kayo ay nasa magkabilang panig huwag nating kalimutan ang ating tungkulin at huwag isaalang alang ang ating tungkulin sana makita natin na kahit ibat ibang ahensya tayo sa pamahalaan kahit na nagaaway away tayo unahin pa rin natin ang kapakanan ng ating bansa while we may be on opposing sides let us not forget our duty and not make light of that duty may we see that even if we belong to different agencies in the government even if we quarrel the interest of our country comes first

5599615 these rooms will be similar in quality to dolphin bay resort in shell beach
5599616 we felt like a lot of their concerns were the same as the coastal commission
5599617 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
5599618 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
5599619 sudah kali bu kan sudah lama faiz pergi coba aja ibu telpon

5599624 the preseason is important but i think the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off
5599625 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5599626 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5599627 genuine risk was an amazing horse with tremendous heart that lived a life befitting a champion
5599628 as a country india must have high and shared aspirations like it had in 1929 when the leaders of the then congress party declared their ambition as poorna swaraj since then india has never had a national aspiration which every indian could share
5599629 the exchange of fire lasted for about nine hours and we have reports that at least 20 militants were killed
5599630 hasta ahora hab a que tener en cuenta a dos tipos de ciudadanos el de los electores y el de los manifestantes nos hab amos acostumbrado a ese mundo a los electores hab a que mirarlos y mimarlos y a los manifestantes temerlos para los primeros estaba la papeleta y el voto en la urna y para los segundos la calle y la televisi n para administrar a los primeros se necesitaban promesas electorales y acciones espectaculares propagadas por los medios de comunicaci n para controlar a los segundos la paciencia o los antidisturbios actualmente con la explosi n de las redes interactivas multimedia como internet aparecen un nuevo tipo de ciudadanos una multitud de personas diversas que desean expresar su opini n y esta situaci n no sabremos c mo gestionarla
5599631 the tree has multiple trunks and each has many living branches

5599635 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power
5599636 thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
5599637 weve had russian strategic aviation challenging in ways they havent even along our borders with the united states which i might note is a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider this is not one that is cost free
5599638 that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world
5599639 en cuanto pensemos que este problema no puede ser resuelto en washington echaremos el cierre
5599640 gleich zwei konferenzen der internationalen homosexuellen und transgender bewegung werden im herbst in wien stattfinden
5599641 da die f r mai in qu bec stadt geplante 24 weltkonferenz der international lesbian and gay association ilga kurzfristig abgesagt werden musste ist die hosi wien als ersatzveranstalterin f r die weltkonferenz eingesprungen und so werden die beiden jeweils viert gigen kongresse unmittelbar hintereinander vom 30 oktober bis 2 november bzw vom 3 bis 6 november in wien stattfinden
5599642 da die ilga heuer ihren 30 geburtstag feiert ist es f r uns eine besondere ehre dieses jahr die weltkonferenz auszurichten
5599643 f r die hosi wien die selber n chstes jahr ihren 30 geburtstag feiern wird ist es auch insofern ein jubil um als wir nun 25 jahre nach der ersten ilga weltkonferenz in wien die tagung zum dritten mal in die stadt holen brigens hat keine andere mitgliedsorganisation so viele tagungen f r die ilga bzw ilga europa ausgerichtet wie wir in keiner anderen stadt der welt fanden so viele ihrer tagungen statt wie in wien neben den beiden weltkonferenzen 1983 und 1989 haben wir 1993 die regionalkonferenz f r s dost und osteuropa sowie 1999 2000 und 2001 drei seminare der ilga europa in wien organisiert
5599644 f r viele potentielle delegierte speziell aus osteuropa und dem globalen s den ist die teilnahme an den konferenzen nur m glich wenn wir als gastgeberin reise und aufenthaltskosten bernehmen
5599645 f r unser diesbez gliches stipendienprogramm suchen wir daher noch sponsoren firmen aber auch privatpersonen die mit ihrer finanziellen unterst tzung die teilnahme von delegierten aus den genannten regionen erm glichen durch gezielte vergabe von stipendien soll sichergestellt werden dass auch vertreterinnen gerade aus jenen regionen teilnehmen k nnen wo die menschenrechte und die gleichstellung von lsbt personen besonders im argen liegen gerade f r sie w re eine teilnahme an diesen konferenzen von besonderer bedeutung immerhin besteht etwa noch in fast 80 l ndern der welt ein totalverbot der homosexualit t
5599646 she fit right in those are the words of this defendant
5599647 shes simply trying to put the pieces of the evening together
5599648 regardless of how you feel about the issue of abortion everyone should applaud the vanderburgh county commission for taking this proactive step in making sure that proper safety requirements are in place if a woman experiences complications after an abortion
5599649 the apa report in fact does draw a very strong and dogmatic conclusion that cannot be defended on the basis of evidence since this evidence is lacking by the admission of the report
5599650 what the committee has in effect said is that until there is compelling evidence to the contrary people should act as though abortion has no harmful effects
5599651 this is not a defensible position in a situation in which there is evidence pointing in the direction of harmful effects
5599652 since there is suggestive evidence of harmful effects it behooves us to err on the side of caution and commission more and better research before drawing strong conclusions
5599653 the american psychological associations so called study is nothing more than a conclusion supported by opinions screened to match that predetermined outcome
5599654 the apa ignored or downplayed large peer reviewed studies showing a clear link between abortion and subsequent problems such as depression
5599655 professionalism and intellectual honesty are not concepts i would associate with this report
5599656 over 600 post abortive women asked to meet with the apa about their experiences with abortion and depression
5599657 the apa brushed them off just like it dismissed any scientific study that didnt agree with its agenda
5599658 its a classic case of the abortion lobbys political and financial interests trumping the truth
5599659 it is unfortunate that the opposition to initiated measure 11 is running their campaign from washington dc the voteyesforlife com campaign is based in south dakota and run by south dakotans
5599660 it is clear that the national pro abortion community is making their last stand in south dakota by bringing in big guns such as cecile richards president of national planned parenthood and leaders from national abortion rights action league
5599661 in 2006 the voters of south dakota spoke loudly they wanted to stop most abortions in south dakota but also wanted reasonable exceptions to allow women to have abortions in cases of rape incest life and health of the mother
5599662 initiated measure 11 meets the demands to include these exceptions this is a reasonable law requested by the people of south dakota
5599663 current public polling shows a majority of south dakota voters would vote
5599664 the campaign expects the number will increase to a healthy majority by election day and that the measure will pass with a large margin in november
5599665 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
5599666 we do not believe that the first paragraph of the abortion section that strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and federal funding of abortion accurately represents the common ground position that americans are seeking
5599667 democrats for life of america will strongly and unequivocally champion the sanctity of life from conception to natural death and will continue to oppose any and all legislation that infringes on that right
5599668 we respect the conscience of each american and recognize that members of our party have deeply held and sometimes differing positions on issues of personal conscience like abortion we recognize the diversity of views as a source of strength and we welcome into our ranks all americans who may hold differing positions on these and other issues
5599669 democrats for life of america appreciates the platform committee adding this statement of general inclusiveness but we will continue to work with the democratic party to explicitly recognize and welcome pro life democrats in the big tent of the democratic party
5599670 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion than if they deliver that pregnancy
5599671 rarely did research designs include a comparison group that was otherwise equivalent to women who had an elective abortion impairing the ability to draw conclusions about relative risks
5599672 following discovery of pregnancy and prior to abortion 40 45 of women experience significant levels of anxiety and around 20 experience significant levels of depressive symptoms distress reduces following abortion but up to around 30 of women are still experiencing emotional problem after a month
5599673 the proportion of women with high levels of anxiety in the month following abortion ranged from 19 27 with 3 9 reporting high levels of depression the better quality studies suggested that 8 32 of women were experiencing high levels of distress
5599674 given the state of the literature a simple calculation of effect sizes or count of the number of studies that showed an effect in one direction versus another was considered inappropriate
5599675 the tfmha evaluated all empirical studies published in english in peer reviewed journals post 1989 that compared the mental health of women who had an induced abortion to the mental health of comparison groups of women n 50 or that examined factors that predict mental health among women who have had an elective abortion in the united states n 23
5599676 the analyses presented in table 3 of the article do not incorporate controls for variables identified as significant predictors of abortion higher education and income and smaller family size these associations between pregnancy outcome and depression are troubling since lower education and income and larger family size predicted depression see table 4 without the controls the delivery group which is associated with lower education and income and larger families will have more depression variance erroneously attributed to pregnancy resolution among the unmarried white women 30 of those in the abortion group had scores exceeding the clinical cut off for depression compared to 16 of the delivery group statistical significance is likely to have been achieved with the controls instituted this group is important to focus on as unmarried white women represent the segment of the u s population obtaining the majority of abortions failure to convey the most scientifically defensible information is inexcusable when the data set contains the necessary variables i strongly urge the authors to run these analyses curiously in all the comparisons throughout the article the authors neglect to control for family size without any explanation
5599677 the abortion debate is so highly charged that a state of respectful listening on either side is almost impossible to achieve
5599678 they showed pretty deep that they can run the football
5599679 had a lot of broken tackles and thats what you look for how can you gain the extra yards
5599680 das innenministerium muss die planstellen der verkehrspolizei deutlich erh hen um weiterhin die sicherheit im stra enverkehr zu gew hrleisten
5599681 und zwar dort wo es um sicherheit geht nicht um geld f r den stra enerhalter zu beschaffen
5599682 es ist f r mich nachvollziehbar dass einige gemeinden diese zweitbeste l sung gew hlt haben
5599683 aber da die verkehrspolizei personell nicht mehr in der lage ist das tempo auf gef hrlichen stra enabschnitten zu berwachen bleibt mir keine andere m glichkeit als das innenministerium aufzufordern die dienstposten bei der verkehrspolizei wieder deutlich aufzustocken denn wenn man nicht rasch auf die entscheidung der datenschutzkommission reagiere hie e das sich mitschuldig zu machen an mehr verletzten und toten auf sterreichs stra en
5599684 der beschluss der datenschutzkommission hat f r sterreichs st dte und gemeinden weitreichende folgen wenn es um die sicherheit auf sterreichs stra en geht darf der bund nicht auf der bremse stehen sondern muss rasch handeln

5599691 theres no question what we have to do is definitely put limits on him
5599692 because he wants to be back and he wants to be going we have to be very careful because hes what i call an instinctive player his instincts take over and he just goes
5599693 what i want to see is what every fan and coach willingham want to see i want to see significant improvement in the way they play along with the improvement were seeing off the field
5599694 ty is a fabulous guy and im fully supportive of him the fans need to be good husky fans they need to say im pulling for him imagine if he rips off a couple of wins early it could be a very special year but you support your people thats what you have to do
5599695 we saw the size of the chips they had on the table
5599696 as in any airport these days concessions are still doing well when theyre located in concourses where flights have not been cut
5599697 any food beverage or retail operation located near a closed gate would be having more difficulty
5599698 i would say that when people are at the airport as passengers waiting for a flight theyre really interested in many things to do whereas a person going to a mall has a specific purpose
5599699 were in our second year now and it has been business as usual in sacramento
5599700 were fortunate that were a growing company in these economic times were bucking the trend
5599701 were getting a lot of commuter travelers and they become repeats and keep coming back and back
5599702 and they tell others were increasing our client base through our regular customers
5599703 one of the ways that we keep the cost of airlines lower
5599704 given the rapidly changing eye care marketplace this is a win for marchon vsp and the optical industry
5599705 i think 70 to 75 percent of houses are being purchased by first time buyers
5599706 i think were now getting to a point where the prices that are out there are finding a market
5599707 i think in the central valley were getting closer to the bottom i still think its going to be 2009
5599708 but i think prices are bottoming out in sacramento the inland empire and some areas around fresno
5599709 even if foreclosures are rising the builders have stopped building
5599710 were approaching an equilibrium a number of different indicators are moving together
5599711 several exciting announcements that will be made regarding the upcoming season
5599712 were very excited about some of the things we have planned for the coming season to let people know what weve been working on since last season
5599713 i cant say anything more at this point but everything is positive and going ahead
5599714 my hope is that this will be big in bringing new riders to the sport
5599715 kids will see this on tv and want to race they may have seen their local bmx course but nothing like this
5599716 it can be performed in an arena its fast and short both men and women can do it and the concept is something a general audience would understand and enjoy looking at
5599717 my dad was very excited when i decided to come to clemson
5599718 i felt like it was going to be tough especially at the quarterback position to have your son playing for you
5599719 i didnt want the pressure of trying to be unbiased because im not unbiased i love the kid i see the positives in him i didnt want to put the pressure on our staff that way and i didnt want my wife whos our water girl to tell me who should start at quarterback
5599720 as a coach i look at this roster we have landon donovan and david beckham as a starting point thats fabulous
5599721 i think we have a good group of players to join in and make this a good team
5599722 las calificaciones siempre son muy dif ciles y a la hora que me hab a tocado a n peor las 9 00 de la ma ana pero he estado haciendo una buena adaptaci n porque todos los d as a las 6 30 estaba con los ojos abiertos
5599723 la t cnica que hice el otro d a me dej un buen sabor de boca y ahora en el calentamiento hice un tiro casi de 61 por lo que cre a que pod a hacerlo
5599724 demasiado a la izquierda y si no bloqueas la izquierda no va
5599725 ten a claro lo que ten a que hacer y el segundo fue muy bien
5599726 lo voy a dar todo como siempre y con la mala experiencia de osaka del a o pasado m s esta vez vengo con muchas mejores sensaciones
5599727 pero para eso hace falta que te pille el d a la hora habiendo tirado bien en la clasificaci n y haber hecho marca del a o bueno estoy muy contenta y lo que venga ser de m s
5599728 haberlo confirmado en la competici n es muy bueno porque suelo fallar en el tema de la carrera y suelo pararme al final pero en fin guay
5599729 ha pasado un a o muy chungo con las lesiones y siempre cuesta salir de ah pero ella vale m s de lo que est tirando en la clasificaci n por lo que por supuesto puede dar la sorpresa
5599730 hay varias ni as por encima de 65 metros y la final va a estar superdisputada yo creo que puedo hacer m s de lo que he hecho pero nunca se sabe
5599731 im third generation british i came to america because ive always wanted to come here and now theyve got me so scared that all i want to do is go home were paying for your stupid war anyway
5599732 the first thing that he will do when he returns home is to focus on his health since he is fairly old
5599733 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5599734 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5599735 we should not be patting ourselves on the back we are supposed to block for him
5599736 he is not supposed to be touched that is our job it is good he felt more comfortable but that is how it is supposed to be
5599737 we took a lot of grief as far as the offensive line goes
5599738 it was our fault whatever we couldnt protect willie the running game was not going that took its toll on us
5599739 you want to have bigger guys protecting the quarterback and pushing the pocket
5599740 i dont think our athleticism has changed a whole lot we are a little bigger but i still think they are very good athletes
5599741 we just recruited some bigger players that is how you want them i dont want to just get a bunch of big guys who cant move that is not going to help you
5599742 we have to clean up some stuff on our execution
5599743 we will show up one morning and not show up the next consistency is plaguing us right now
5599744 those five move this team we cant get anything started without them
5599745 we have been smart trying to get what we could and still have a physical presence but keeping our players healthy
5599746 you have to be careful of your players and try not to beat them up too much
5599747 we dont have the depth a lot of teams have you want your best 11 to be ready by the season opener aug 30 as of right now we will be 100 percent healthy for the first game
5599748 it is kind of par for the course we didnt practice nearly well enough this morning
5599749 its done i fly out in the morning to cleveland
5599750 this is a good opportunity to get right back into the big leagues
5599751 the europcar business is the main contributor to consolidated revenues
5599752 the outstanding results for the first half of 2008 reflect on the one hand the organic growth of the business and on the other the positive financial impact of eurazeos acquisition of premierfirst in february 2007 betacar in the third quarter of 2007 and the europcar asia pacific franchise in may this year
5599753 europcar australasia is the third largest vehicle hire operator in australia and one of the largest in new zealand
5599754 the company has strong brand recognition and continues to aggressively grow its business throughout the region which made the acquisition of the europcar asia pacific franchise a well placed strategic move for europcar internationals organic growth
5599755 these acquisitions reinforce our policy of operating a young fleet that provides more passenger comfort in our quest for tam service excellence the 777 300er also supports tams two other pillars of excellence upon which our company measures performance technical operational excellence and excellence in management

5599761 these record results where achieved through completing the first phase of our strategy of concentrating on emerging markets and ensuring strong presence in those markets the future will see ifa hotels amp resorts entering additional new markets
5599762 in the following seasons based on port call bookings there will be a 15 increase in passenger numbers this will put pressure on infrastructure and tourist services at many destinations which are already facing a number of challenges
5599763 research shows that close to 70 of american visitors who come to new zealand on a cruise want to return for a longer holiday
5599764 russia represents a key emerging market for etihad the countrys recent economic development is creating an increasingly affluent population with a huge appetite to access abu dhabis property market and growing leisure attractions
5599765 in addition abu dhabi provides an ideal launch pad for russian based air travellers keen to access the growing number of international destinations now served by etihad airways
5599766 we are delighted to bring the westin heavenly experience to travelers in flight and on the ground in united red carpet clubs
5599767 this unique partnership is one more way westin is bringing meaningful renewing experiences to the traveling public
5599768 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
5599769 ba argues that the aviation landscape has changed since their last failed application i disagree nothing has changed
5599770 the current economic slowdown is also no justification for agreeing to this alliance
5599771 we are not against consolidation but this alliance is on a scale never seen before ba aa with iberia wont create fair play so we say no way ba aa
5599772 i didnt see myself back here months and months ago
5599773 i dont know i talked to my family about it i cant believe i made it back
5599774 i was in no shape to go forward months ago but it feels good after everything thats happened its amazing to get this chance to play against brazil again
5599775 i feel great with my teammates ive never been that player thats been overly close with my teammates just because were all so busy
5599776 and im 27 years old we have our lives at home i have my good support system back at home you come in here and youre as close as you need to be to get the job done but i feel great right now and i feel great with my teammates
5599777 it will be nice to get some revenge i guess
5599778 it has nothing to do with those shots that scurry allowed that was 11 months ago i dont think its a personal thing any more i think its our team wanting to reclaim what we could have gotten at the world cup it has nothing to do with anything personal right now
5599779 i think it would be nice to play brazil because you always want to reclaim what you could have had
5599780 but if they hadnt made it to the final i still would have been happy because we did what we needed to do to get here
5599781 i think one of the most amazing things with our team is that we dont have that big name player
5599782 people dont really know us and i think our team is finding so much energy with that
5599783 we have numerous people scoring goals we have numerous people stepping up but for us we like it that we dont have a big name player we have new faces everything feels fresh its like were making our own statement writing our own script
5599784 i had given her everything except the south i had stolen her calling card

5599797 the american public has not only been misled during this election campaign but has also been fed a constant stream of irrelevant information many questions could be posed that are hard to beat in terms of drama what would happen if the democrats really were to withdraw the us army from iraq how does barack obama plan to address the threat that the killing fields of cambodia could be repeated in basra and baghdad does he have a plan or even an idea for dealing with the day after how do the republicans plan to end the scandal of the uninsured some 47 million people in america now have no health insurance around 9 million have been added to that total during the seven years george w bush has been in power this is the greatest market failure since the invention of modern capitalism

5599826 i have faithfully sincerely and honestly represented the school p amp cs views to the government however the government has made a decision in the best interest of student outcomes
5599827 im going to try to save those heritage buildings at blackstone state school for the community
5599828 the students at those schools will in the long run be better off in new modern facilities
5599829 in one hit well be taking them from the chalk and talk routine across to white boards and keyboards
5599830 the three primary schools being renewed are close to dinmore and blackstone schools and will be easily able to accommodate their students in far superior facilities offering our young people better educational opportunities

5599836 dark matter developers dont care about their job when theyre not at it
5599837 it sure lines out a lot of work we have to do
5599838 no matter what anxiety you have leading up to it you can count on one thing and thats the kids showing up on the first day
5599839 they did such a good job cleaning up from last year
5599840 id actually pay to buy a ticket for that one
5599841 who else was up there patrick ewing so patrick david and karl malone that would be interesting
5599842 the world is embracing the sport that the dream teamers brought to barcelona
5599843 and i would say the 2008 olympics really demonstrate that complete embrace
5599844 you know i didnt even dare to think about that
5599845 the question was one step at a time if youve been along on the journey sometimes you dont realize how far youve come
5599846 that would be a separate league that would be nba affiliated or nba sponsored but it would be independent
5599847 and it would just sign players for a very long time to come it would be at a lower scale than the nba but as the sport develops in china and as more players around the world recognize the opportunities of playing in china we see that league growing and strengthening
5599848 i think that that is likely to become a regular thing
5599849 coming out of athens there was just more of a focus at every level on the game and the representation of ones country and were just doing a better job collectively on that front
5599850 i think that i would encourage usa basketball and the nba players to focus upon longer than bringing a group together
5599851 i think that commitment is not just about the teamwork but also about the international discipline that comes from basketball diplomacy and our players are learning their lessons well
5599852 you literally feel the concussion blast moving through the vehicle
5599853 i just ignored the headaches the headaches as far as i was concerned was stress from the situation
5599854 its more like a new dad but hes still got some of the old dad in him
5599855 he used to be a big joker and now hes not he doesnt joke around like he used to
5599856 i made a decision a while back that yeah id rather be more sedated than more angry
5599857 theyre in for a big surprise when they come home
5599858 we can kind of relax and get to know each other as a family again
5599859 we went through some rough times cause the only emotion i knew how to show was either indifference or anger and i know for a while the kids were scared of me
5599860 i couldnt tell you the last time i was home to be to one of her dance recitals
5599861 if a child is undernourished the nerve connections in the brain arent as robust as they should be
5599862 the lack of economic growth in the west will impact demand
5599863 the hurricane season is still a major issue as seen in 2005 with katrina we have to be mindful of that
5599864 at this time in my life i thought i would be on a cruise ship to panama or the mediterranean retired with my tilley hats my sneakers but im a single lady now and i want to keep working
5599865 that became very confusing some people really enjoyed it and some just wanted us to get on with the story
5599866 over the years ellys nose grew up to the size of a potato now im drawing it smaller again the way it was when i first started
5599867 the war within a secret white house history 2006 2008
5599868 there has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the nixon tapes and the pentagon papers
5599869 this is the declassification of what went on in secret behind the scenes
5599870 takes readers deep inside the white house the pentagon the state department the intelligence agencies and the u s military headquarters in iraq
5599871 based on extensive interviews with participants contemporaneous notes and secret documents the book traces the internal debates tensions and critical turning points in the iraq war during an extraordinary two year period
5599872 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5599873 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision
5599874 in an irony sure to set blogger hearts beating giddily the film graces the cover of ews new fall preview issue
5599875 ew and warner bros share a parent company but they clearly do not share you know important information
5599876 those who know me know that there is no money in the world that you could pay me for me to go up to a table where there are two beautiful women and invite them to come with me to oviedo
5599877 thats why you want to be an actor you want to live lives that you know would be impossible
5599878 its like id never kill anyone like my character in no country for old men but my killer side of me is already satisfied
5599879 the thought of him coming to spain and making a movie here i thought could be a great experience like it was
5599880 i loved the script and there wasnt much to talk about it was like ok where do i have to go
5599881 its funny when you go and work outside of your country when you come back even if i live here some people might think that i live in the states some people might think that i am impossible to reach some think that i might be a millionaire that earns a lot of money in movies so they cant afford me
5599882 so they have a lot of reasons and some of them may find me a really horrible actor and some of them may find me very old there are many reasons for people not to call me
5599883 but that doesnt mean that i dont want to do it actually it is what i want to do
5599884 my vocals have always been polarizing even in the blood brothers
5599885 im really inspired by surrealist artists like salvador dal max ernst marcel duchamp taking what they did in terms of imagery and integrating that into writing
5599886 in writing lyrics i find the more serious you take yourself the harder it is to finish what youre doing i take what i do seriously but ive never been the kind of person thats had success in drawing from my own experience whenever i have its infused with bizarre imagery
5599887 johnny and i had some good conversations prior to the band about wanting it to be more melodic have things be more understandable in his vocals than they were in the past
5599888 its the first priority for us you hope that people like what youre doing its the lifeline of what you do people coming to your shows so you can continue doing it but from the get go we just wanted to write the songs we want to write we dont take it personally if someone that likes blood brothers doesnt like jaguar love you cant please everyone
5599889 i think he must have been pretty embarrassed were planning to frame the notice
5599890 simply keeping a lid on 90210 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5599891 the number and diversity of people who are extremely bothered by the facts and the perception of the implementation of 287 g is vast and quickly gaining momentum nationally and locally
5599892 undue fear anxiety and distress that will create greater divisions in our communities
5599893 to re evaluate the humanitarian the moral and spiritual implications of programs like to 287 g
5599894 i do not believe that sheriff johnson or his staff is overstepping their bounds
5599895 but people who break the laws and enter our country illegally obtain illegal social security numbers and commit other incidents are breaking the laws of our country and should be held accountable
5599896 what has happened to our country our state and our county when a government employee cannot report a felony crime
5599897 this is absurd and goes against the very moral fiber that our country was founded upon
5599898 if you want to come here illegally and live in this country do not violate any laws
5599899 but as long as im sheriff i am going to do my job commissioners and the only thing that you can do is cut my budget
5599900 had gotten people stirred up by saying the sheriffs office profiles
5599901 two exclusive all new scene it games and a brand new a amp e documentary on the film featuring interviews with cast and crew members including john landis

5599906 seattle center will be attractive inviting to people of all ages and affordable for everyone
5599907 people shouldnt have to purchase tickets or go to a performance to go to seattle center it should be a major attraction as any park would be
5599908 it is a long range plan so we will be paying for it incrementally over time
5599909 its going to be a combination of private money foundation money and public money much as previous improvements to the center have been
5599910 the unstable air hit and it blew up on em
5599911 up until the early 1990s the missoula floods story really was only known to scientists
5599912 i was thinking of the book the last good kiss by james crumley and lincolns statement that the u s was the last best hope of mankind
5599913 the phrase popped into my head and i said how about the last best place
5599914 it was intended as a gift to the people of montana
5599915 people just need to understand the severity of making prank calls
5599916 its like dialing 911 youre pulling people away from a real emergency where they are needed
5599917 im an american now im an american now now i get to stay with my mother and father and my sisters
5599918 and then he started naming all the pets he gets to stay with
5599919 i didnt realize how worried he was about this asylum thing
5599920 will you always take care of me will you love me forever
5599921 capitol hill has jimi hendrix so we just want to give the man his due and recognition for all the wonderful things hes done for our neighborhood
5599922 i think kapow has found themselves a wonderful way to make more money poking fun at paul allen than selling coffee
5599923 im pretty skeptical anyone could do a 300 foot statue anywhere in the neighborhood or anywhere in the city
5599924 i think paul allen has done a lot for the area
5599925 if youve got buildings going up too tall for people to see the lake a 300 foot statue is kind of speaking to that isnt it
5599926 a wave goes right in your face when youre trying to take a breath
5599927 not many people can say theyve swam around mercer island
5599928 i feel like weve really accomplished something that no other girl our age has done
5599929 having this other person or people say this happened to me too in the same kind of way can absolutely increase convictions
5599930 juries can see oh theres a pattern hes done this before it can combat the idea that they cant convict an 80 year old guy because now they can see hes been doing this for the past 40 years
5599931 we were a close family taught to respect our elders
5599932 i didnt know about the birds and the bees i just felt really scared
5599933 he has never told me what this whatever you call it is about he has never explained himself
5599934 he was always like a big giant teddy bear with the kids
5599935 we would lose a track meet by just a couple of points and between the two of us we would talk about how disappointed we were but he would never show that to the kids he was always positive
5599936 he liked seeing people grow and get better and reach their potential
5599937 he had some very successful athletes over the years but he was also concerned that they were good kids not just good athletes
5599938 he kept in touch with a lot of his athletes even after he retired we would have kids drop by our home and show us their children
5599939 at this point we dont know when it happened without any tips this could be a hard one to figure out
5599940 because its venting properly itll maintain a temperature that will reduce the risk of explosion
5599941 its not good for you staying out alone do you want me to accompany you
5599942 ok what will you do if i bring you somewhere else somewhere private
5599943 india should learn a lesson from this gathering and immediately solve the kashmir dispute as these types of mass revolutions have destroyed huge empires
5599944 for one thing the kernel is quite complex and big and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules not just for the code but for how the whole development environment works similarly for a new developer it will take time before people start recognizing the name and start trusting the developer to do the right things
5599945 we make it fairly easy for people to ease into kernel development
5599946 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5599947 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5599948 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple
5599949 of course some people will be alienated and theres no doubt that the process could probably be improved
5599950 not a warm and fuzzy environment where people sing kumbaya around the fireplace
5599951 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
5599952 in an os kernel there are simply more security and stability requirements and the bar is really higher in some respects that will inevitably also reflect in the response to patches
5599953 i think that one of the things weve been very good at is to scale up with a good network of maintainers so that most people involved actually dont work closely with more than a handful of people
5599954 normally the people you find at the core of open source projects are professional software engineers these guys know how to run software projects
5599955 based on current market conditions and fuel prices a positive result for the current financial year is expected but remains a challenge
5599956 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5599957 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5599958 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5599959 is content to rely on the failed policies of president bush

5599969 theyre a physical team a tough team and im pretty sure theyre going to take that game and take some confidence out of it
5599970 we sent a big message every time we go on the court were trying to send a message to the whole field no matter who we are playing
5599971 catchings was unbelievable what she brought the loose balls the blocks the tips the way she locked up valdemoro who had given us problems in that stretch i felt she completely changed the game for us on the defensive end
5599972 its a real life spin city focusing on the day to day life of a mayor running a major american city under the incredible pressure of having a star studded political convention descend upon his domain
5599973 in this case the mayor is denvers john hickenlooper yes a close relative who time magazine named in 2006 as one of the five most important and progressive mayors in the nation we just came from an inside meeting with the governor senator congressmen a lot of interesting information about how colorado which is hosting the convention may ironically turn out to be this years big swing state like florida was in 2000 and ohio in 2004
5599974 plays like goodfellas in washington the script also explores an aspect of abramoff that no one really knows about that he was connected to not responsible for a murder and this is a man who had no problems getting into the oval office to see george w bush or karl rove incredible
5599975 id actually pay to buy a ticket for that one
5599976 david robinson and karl malone and that was the frontcourt
5599977 who else was up there patrick ewing so patrick david and karl malone that would be interesting
5599978 the world is embracing the sport that the dream teamers brought to barcelona
5599979 and i would say the 2008 olympics really demonstrate that complete embrace
5599980 you know i didnt even dare to think about that
5599981 the question was one step at a time if youve been along on the journey sometimes you dont realize how far youve come
5599982 its import for us to protect urban rivers and waterways around the country
5599983 we are stepping up to ensure that the clean water act tools are applied consistently and fairly and we all work together to protect the l a river
5599984 we think its important to look at the rest of the river
5599985 im trying to learn as much as i can from brett
5599986 he has a lot of wisdom i can learn from
5599987 we played a very complete game aside from a few mistakes by me
5599988 but then the wheels come off when you start to argue you talk about it we know where we are on the court we know when to push we have jedi mind chick
5599989 i hope fans dont get the impression that thats how you play baseball today was a rare game
5599990 i did what i did and they just happened that they cut the ball off
5599991 i didnt have the intention to do what i did i would have rather slid but the catcher was in the way
5599992 we do not throw to hit people we do not teach that in china we dont teach it in the united states he tried to throw the ball inside and it got away from him
5599993 it has more computers and more space for books and people including a meeting room an adult literacy center and special storytelling areas for children and teenagers
5599994 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5599995 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5599996 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5599997 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5599998 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5599999 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
