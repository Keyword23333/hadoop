4490220 i love to write i love to write i love to write ok lets write this paper
4490221 how did you just find out about this paper yesterday
4490222 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus
4490223 at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
4490224 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4490225 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died
4490226 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4490227 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4490228 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4490229 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4490230 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4490231 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4490232 i think rick is in an unenviable position in that he stands to get attacked from the right and the left based on what direction he takes
4490233 as an evangelical i am much more interested in his list of questions than in either of their answers
4490234 aku berdiskusi dengan seluruh tim ini dan aku inginkan ada perombakan permainan kami tidak ingin terus terusan kalah apalagi posisi kami di klasemen juga tidak begitu bagus
4490235 anda lihat sendiri bagaimana anak asuh saya tampak tegang dalam bermain mereka selalu salah dalam komunikasi karena mental yang jatuh setelah kalah dalam beberapa pertandingan sebelumnya dan jujur membenahi mental pemain bukan hal yang mudah
4490236 last night lisaraye her cousin phillip travis and her publicist lynn jeter assaulted the guard at the premiers home proceeded to ransack the house and then assaulted the premier and his sister as the result of her assault on them both the premier and his sister were taken to the hospital with injuries and later released the premier at no time had any physical contact with lisaraye
4490237 it is public knowledge that the couple has been separated for months and lisaraye has no lawful right to be in the residence her conduct yesterday clearly contradicts her stated commitment to dissolve the marriage amicably
4490238 it is with great sadness that i have to announce that my husband and i have separated last night wednesday august 13 2008 an attempt was made by and on behalf of my husband to first prevent my entry into our home and then later to make me leave our home by force it was necessary for me to receive medical treatment for injuries suffered and in relation to those injuries i shall continue to assist the police force with its inquiries
4490239 whilst it is my sincere wish to avoid unnecessary conflict i shall not be intimidated nor shall those individuals whose job it is to protect and represent me i ask that my privacy be respected in these difficult times and i believe that the people of the tci will understand and support my wish to receive the necessary independent representation from the legal counsel of my choosing i hope that in time the tci government will come to share that view
4490240 although i have always been a supportive wife even in light of the very serious allegations currently pending against the premier there are limits even for me
4490241 we had built the sets and designed costumes but we couldnt seem to find a sonic screwdriver anywhere as the play is about time travel we really needed the prop which is seen in doctor who shows
4490242 everyone at pontlliw players is over the moon with the prop now weve got everything in place we cant wait for the show to begin
4490243 you could draw a horizontal line from houston to jacksonville and from dallas to atlanta in between i 20 and i 10 and there would be as many football players in that area than any other area in the country
4490244 in most of the rest of the world college football is a game and they love it in the south its not a game its a way of life
4490245 its built into the dna like no other place in the world
4490246 the biggest city in the country is not producing football players
4490247 new york and philadelphia the two largest cities on the east coast have been perennial basketball hotbeds
4490248 the weather gives them a chance to be practicing be involved with football pretty much year round
4490249 i think that helps you dont see the basketball and some of those things hockey as prevalent down south as you do in the northeast
4490250 how am i going to survive there ive never seen snow ive never experienced a cold cold weather
4490251 it was like kansas south florida kansas south florida south floridas up and coming i was like im staying here that was a no brainer
4490252 a lot of florida guys dont want to go up north with all that cold weather
4490253 with all the schools being down here now i think it does make it harder for those out of state schools to come down here and pull guys out
4490254 you look at a high school kid in florida for instance they get 20 spring practices
4490255 thats 60 practices that a young man would have in his high school career that a young man up here doesnt have
4490256 knowing that thats going to happen spring practice what does that do to the guys getting ready for it in the spring opposed to getting ready for it only in august
4490257 maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
4490258 i dont like that color why are you doing it that way
4490259 im not sure i didnt buy the ticket someone bought it for me
4490260 do you have any copies of the paperwork for the ticket or a confirmation number
4490261 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
4490262 torchwood has really reached out to audiences worldwide and the fact its moved up the channels on the bbc is incredible
4490263 its an exciting thing to be a part of we have done a read through of the first three episodes and start filming next week
4490264 i know that these countries they need help all kinds of help and when you come to a developed country i had the chance to train in good universities like mcgill universitys surgery ive been working in an excellent hospital here in sherbrooke and i feel it is my obligation to give some time and expertise to these poor populations
4490265 i would like to take this opportunity to apologise to him his friends and family for any distortion of public opinion or distress that my comments may have had and i hope this letter serves to go some way to correct that
4490266 you didnt get the park project but you will get this

4490285 for too many years information about the quality of american higher education has been monopolized by one publication u s news amp world report
4490286 the first of the ufu fishing trips commenced today and it is comforting to see the large number of members signing on to go fishing
4490287 it is worthwhile remembering the larger the number of people fishing the bigger the catch
4490288 members of their own volition who are sick of the way they are being treated by the government and the fire service over their work value are protesting by simply refusing to give up their leisure time
4490289 many markers have lost confidence in the system and even with ets out of the picture it will be difficult to deliver a wholly successful system in 2009
4490290 in the long term appointing a new administrator for these tests is akin to rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic
4490291 the testing and examination system is sinking under its own weight and it is time for the government to examine seriously how it can streamline the assessment regime and again make it fit for purpose
4490292 it is simply not possible for the qca to appoint a new test contractor to deliver the sats exams for 2009
4490293 the government needs to take this golden opportunity to completely overhaul its testing regime and in the interim should suspend sats for 2009
4490294 we want testing to work in a way that is not stressful for children and tracks individual progress
4490295 i am open minded about reform and i am not saying that the current system is set in stone
4490296 the wrong thing for us to do would be to suspend the tests in 2009
4490297 we think that continuing on with externally evaluated national tests is important for parents schools and education
4490298 ill only implement it following a rigorous evaluation of whether it helps children make faster progress
4490299 far from abandoning independent assessment i hope the new tests will allow parents to get much more useful information on how their child is progressing

4490304 parents may not refuse compulsory schooling on the basis of their convictions
4490305 children are unable to foresee the consequences of their parents decision for home education because of their young age schools represent society and it is in the childrens interest to become part of that society the parents right to educate does not go as far as to deprive their children of that experience
4490306 the general interest of society to avoid the emergence of parallel societies based on separate philosophical convictions and the importance of integrating minorities into society
4490307 you can faintly hear the three females talking throughout the recording you will hear a female the family member say hello baby and another long conversation those are all human voices but what sounds like a struggle or attack is going on as well
4490308 the male voice you hear was not present at the hotel you will hear a cuckoo clock which was not present a ticking of a hall clock which was there you will hear what sounds like the microphone being moved which was not touched and then the sound becomes clearer
4490309 you will hear a creaking door and slamming of the door which is real then you will hear a unknown woman say get off me and what sounds like the woman being attacked the struggle continues for awhile and during the evp you can hear some of my investigators conversations after interviewing my investigators they said they went and sat on the stairs of this hotel because they heard from an above floor what sounded like footsteps and conversations not what you hear on this recording when the noises stop you hear the investigators participate in a lulled conversation they stated that they started to talk when the noises stopped in their conversation you will hear a male voice say help me several times
4490310 the evp has not been altered in any way except it was edited for time

4490324 big firms versus smaller firms which should you choose when do you leave should you
4490325 the doctor strongly suggested that if i wanted to heal properly i needed to quit
4490326 when you start talking about your face it becomes motivating
4490327 when someone hears this from an internist or cardiologist who says its really bad for you it increases your risk of lung cancer its bad for your heart people tend to blow that off if theyre feeling well
4490328 but if they have a medical problem and are not going for just a routine checkup they may tend to listen to that advice more
4490329 with plastic surgery its a little bit different people are desirous of an elective procedure and thats their main objective in coming in its something they truly want
4490330 nicotine causes the tiny blood vessels in the skin to clamp down or constrict which reduces blood supply to the skin
4490331 twenty five years ago it may have been more acceptable for a patient to have undergone surgical procedures while smoking
4490332 nowadays if a doctor knew a patient was smoking and they did flap surgery
4490333 why invest so much money in a cosmetic procedure for enhancement if the patient will not participate and do his or her part to help ensure the best outcome possible
4490334 you can talk to people about quitting smoking but you may not have a months worth of time before you try to save their life with heart surgery
4490335 with the advent of things like chantix we have a much higher success rate
4490336 i want it to look great for you as well as for myself if they smoke even one cigarette i run the risk of it not healing its like trying to water your lawn with a crimped hose
4490337 this is not a prime driver of quitting in america
4490338 these are all adults and im not going to be the person looking over their shoulders
4490339 this was like the first major surgery id had as an adult
4490340 so when my doctor who i respect tells me not to smoke and here are some reasons why then i have to respect that
4490341 they see the wound opening up turning red or black the edges start coming apart
4490342 they see the skin graft we use to put it back together
4490343 i was afraid the anesthesia would go wrong or id wake up coughing my head off and split my guts open

4490346 we have registered an interest in webster from rangers because we heard he might be available
4490347 and john sutton we heard might want to come north again so we have asked to be kept informed on that one but that is as far as it has gone
4490348 this is a fantastic opportunity for the industry and educators to come together to discuss issues that affect them both
4490349 by rolling out up to date interactive crime maps we can better inform people about crime problems in their area and enable them to have much more of a say in what their local police focus on

4490385 it is properly called a rebirth not a birth a reawakening not awakening because in many of us besides being a new thing it is also the recovery of things we had in childhood and lost when we became boys for boyhood is very like the dark ages not as they were but as they are represented in bad short histories the dreams of childhood and those of adolescence may have much in common between them often boyhood stretches like an alien territory in which everything ourselves included has been greedy cruel noisy and prosaic in which the imagination has slept and the most unideal sense and ambitions have been restlessly even maniacally awake
4490386 there are several reasons that we chose prince rupert but the main three are that we see it as a growing market because of the new port development because of the demographics and because of the population
4490387 in terms of the demographics there are a lot of blue collar workers in prince rupert its also a bit of an isolated market in that the nearest large centre is prince george and we have always done well in those kinds of markets

4490398 reapers are class a dangerous beings capable of death they can store sedative and or amnesiacs in their talons and claws they appear when the space time continuum has been disrupted by a contusion or movement through the hyperbolic space time momentum following this they claim the region affected by the contusion as their own and systematically destroy everything within it destroying them means completing the event chain prior to the contusion which will restore the timeline to its original state

4490414 you see our dilemma and why it is so well protected what sort of thing expands and makes itself unnoticeable if it does not mean to cause harm
4490415 humans paranoid lot you are cant imagine it would be something good could you
4490416 rather clever reverse one actually it moves backwards in time ive only seen it once before quite harmless because you see its already opened in your own past perhaps oh three hundred years ago it was about the size of a pea then perfectly visible in another two hundred years it will be the size of an oven and quite invisible you wont see it you wont know its there but itll open up and gather up all the ideas of all the people nearby until its quite full and then close up and begin its journey to the past by the time its done all those marvelous ideas will have condensed themselves into a single most important thought and whoever runs across the capsule will take that thought for themselves perpetuating the cycle lovely thing really when its done properly
4490417 if what you say is true this has the potential to be a useful tool
4490418 i suppose you cant control it though all those thoughts its not you who decides what emerges
4490419 john thank you youve been a tremendous help to us
4490420 i can call on you again should need arise yes
4490421 its all right leave your books as they are theyll be all right for one night
4490422 its a time capsule only it works in reverse takes messages from the future to the past he sees it as a weapon put his own ideas and thoughts into it all in the name of keeping humans safe
4490423 im trapped in this body in this time on this planet im trapped and i cant do anything about it theres no escape theres no way to make sure that whatever goes into that capsule is good and reasonable how can i make sure he doesnt do what he wants doesnt turn what ought to be a wonderful and fantastic present into a weapon against his own kind he doesnt know its power i cant even explain it to him hes human his brain is too small for it he cant possibly understand he cant comprehend how infinitely unstable time is hell never be able to see that turning that capsule into a weapon could end in the capsule having never existed in the first place
4490424 you know rose you know you held the vortex in yourself once upon a time you know it cant be controlled it nearly killed you it nearly killed donna he couldnt know i cant hope to tell him
4490425 theres nothing i can do here rose nothing im useless im useless to torchwood and useless to you and useless to myself i cant be the man i was and i cant be the man you want me to be i dont fit here i dont fit anywhere im making a mess of everything i touch because i know what ought to be done and i cant do it
4490426 im small rose thats all i am small insignificant human and youll hate me for it someday youll wake up and realize im not who you think i am
4490427 youre not human youve never been human cant you tell youve been trying for so long to only be human and youre killing us both every day we say a little less to each other every night we move a little bit slower every time you make love to me its less and less you youre only marking time
4490428 we dont mark time we revel in it we cherish every minute we make the most whatever were given youre doing everything but marking it youre trying to ignore its passage entirely youre running from it
4490429 i dont care if you never go to torchwood again
4490430 well let you go of course youve never signed a contract so we have no hold on you
4490431 not for you not for how you want it to be
4490432 i know youre clever john its one of the reasons i wanted you here
4490433 but i dare say the lot of us could figure out how to use that sphere properly if given time and you say we have two hundred years
4490434 time is not black and white i told your president once i told him not to ask he ignored me and he died are you really going to doubt me now
4490435 but john should i need your help again you will give it
4490436 no youve got it all wrong you cant just assume that the conjugate variables are thermal youve got to consider the mechanical and chemical as well think of it like a triangle
4490437 thermodynamics yes youve got the main three yes but theres five others to consider electrical magnetic surface elasticity and gravitational potential
4490438 now you can ignore those for the general bits and pieces kiddy work really but whatever numbers you come up with arent going to work in real life theyre only to please your professor and show that youre all good little monkeys following a plan
4490439 good show henry lovely boat here only it wont float want me to explain why
4490440 ive explained five times now id like to see if you can knock it through his thick skull
4490441 youth is no excuse for ignorance particularly monkeys striving to impress their professor but please
4490442 particularly when youve trumped me for the day where do you teach
4490443 i dont not anymore did once im sorry i didnt realize you were i apologize for interrupting your lesson
4490444 ah not a lesson just a bit of helpful advice monkeys indeed theyll come find you now i expect care to join me for tea i liked your explanation of the hydraulics i would very much like to hear more
4490445 after watching jason lezak yesterday i just realized that anything is possible if you want it bad enough
4490446 jeder in china wei dass tibet teil des chinesischen territoriums ist
4490447 always remember there was nothing worth sharing like the love that let us share our name
4490448 ernie youre 91 you look so young and vibrant how do you do it
4490449 it was not handled right by our officer but whether there was a violation of our policy that is subject to punishment i dont know
4490450 chill out its just a dog you can buy another one
4490451 gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
4490452 we believe that if the fec looks into this they will find what weve known all along that we did nothing wrong
4490453 the cafeteria will be up and running hopefully by mid to late october
4490454 i see no reason to have grieco sit for six months
4490455 as soon as the asset is available it behooves us to get in there
4490456 the students and teachers are being systematically placed so during the mid year move students will not have to move a second time
4490457 the kids are excited they cant wait until they actually get there
4490458 like any other construction project its a little inconvenient as you go through it but its worth it
4490459 the cafeteria will be up and running hopefully by mid to late october
4490460 i see no reason to have grieco sit for six months
4490461 as soon as the asset is available it behooves us to get in there
4490462 the students and teachers are being systematically placed so during the mid year move students will not have to move a second time
4490463 the kids are excited they cant wait until they actually get there
4490464 like any other construction project its a little inconvenient as you go through it but its worth it
4490465 its crazy this man rangel controls tax policy in the united states rangel is chairman of ways and means hes a lot bigger than just a regular member of congress he deserves more respect than this
4490466 basically they have told us they cant help us that there are too many obama supporters ahead of charlie on the line
4490467 i think sen gramm would be in serious consideration for ambassador to belarus although im not sure the citizens of minsk would welcome that

4490477 si alguien desea que se modifique la ley tiene que proponerlo pero el presidente tiene que hacer que se cumpla la ley

4490485 mi criterio es que sin nimo de revancha se averiguara la verdad por completo para honrar a los muertos y para que nunca m s pueda repetirse un accidente de esa naturaleza por las mismas causas que aquel se ocasion
4490486 ahora se sabe mucho m s de lo que se sab a
4490487 lo que hice fue averiguar una verdad que cuando llegu al ministerio hab a sido ocultada y lo hice porque me lo pidieron las familias de los que hab an muerto cuyos cad veres les hab an sido entregados con falsedad y hasta hubo que desenterrarlos proclam lo que he hecho y volver a a hacer es ayudar a los familiares a conocer la verdad
4490488 personalmente me cae bien y le deseo que le vayan bien las cosas en su partido

4490499 thats why im here if not i wouldve stayed home and watched it on tv
4490500 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4490501 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4490502 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4490503 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4490504 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4490505 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4490506 its not over tonight just give me one more chance to make it right i wont go home without you
4490507 i was getting frustrated and i thought well that will have to do
4490508 it was delightful news you never expect that sort of stuff
4490509 i was an actor for a long time so i have been through that experience before
4490510 the less thought you give to it the better or youd drive yourself mad
4490511 i came to dislike almost everything about it i was exactly the wrong kind of person to be an actor what it came down to for me was having zero control over your future

4490518 that seemed like another world then with mick i went to peake station in the far north of south australia and that really got me he was so enthusiastic to show me the landscape of his stories thats what mattered most to him
4490519 i came to know the people i worked with in those days very well
4490520 they had interesting and beautiful thought worlds it wasnt just a case of having different words for the east and west sides of a sand dune they had for instance a special word for the idea of leaving for the last time theyd speak of leaving by one track only this was a journey of discovery i set off on 45 years ago and at once i felt the urgency of the task it takes you over and thats all you want to do
4490521 in spite of what people like to say about the languages going to sleep or changing thats nonsense my work is one of preservation you do it so that people are not just a name on a tribal map but are remembered asactual people with ideas and stories of theirown
4490522 whenever as appears to be common these days people claim they are the first to cross the simpson desert from south to north or west to east walking or running in winter or summer they forget that others were there before them the simpson desert was home for generations of aboriginal people
4490523 its not just that shes a very broad ranging linguist
4490524 or one with an ear for history shes upright in herself shes one of the most judgmental people ive ever met and if youre not with her youre against her she wants people to observe a code in relation to knowledge she has a view that there was a time when knowledge was full and complete and was available to those in a group who had proved themselves and it didnt flow automatically the people she most admires are those who suffered all the vexations and indignities of european contact without spilling a drop of precious knowledge and one example of course was her chief informant mickmclean
4490525 never to give up the quest she couldnt have turned down the chance to come out here into the desert and see this find for herself
4490526 images that just dont belong to our world its like picking up a stone tool in the sand you dont need it explained shes got this astounding ability all her work is like perfect shards giving us a light in the darkness we think of this country as desert but the desert people thought of it as home and luise captures the essence of their humanity with those little flicks of understanding
4490527 thats clear but a treasure of an unusual kind who reminds us about the hard course of australian history it pains me that shes the last fluent speaker of dieri tirari wangkanguru and arabana although of course she says she knows hardly anything about those languages it pains me i find it boundlessly sad
4490528 then of course theres a person lying here of high degree there are so many caps that if you translate it to a single death youre looking at the possibility of such a high ranking youve pushed that individual up into a zone unprecedented in our knowledge of the deserts but theres a chance were wrong and theres a totem involved or a dreaming affiliation and people placed their caps here while singing to regenerate the mourning process the more one talks about this the more one feels out of ones depth the more too one feels the need to be careful and share the knowledge gathered here with those who would have received the traditions that seem quite locked in the desert now
4490529 its all so close in time the time when this country was alive and full so close and so removed but theres an essence in the landscape still maybe the only way to trigger that essence back to life is through discussions like this one when men and women like don rowlands and luise hercus have come out here
4490530 jugendliche und junge erwachsene werden dort an einer empfindlichen stelle getroffen

4490533 why stop there i wonder and not just go ahead and ask if theres a canadian consulate nearby
4490534 eating in front of other people is always somewhat embarrassing like being caught in an illicit moment of arousal
4490535 i have a freezer full of chicken stock should there be a need for post apocalyptic risotto im the guy to see
4490536 im a colonial from canada and my parents are from south africa
4490537 as a clan weve been in canada longer than we were in south africa canada remains interesting to me for a variety of reasons its one generation behind the us you still have people who come from small towns
4490538 there was lots of british empire stuff coming through the transom all the time
4490539 skippy the bush kangaroo a lot of wendy hughes movies we learned waltzing matilda in primary school i saw a lot of small independent australian films that came through canada when i was in high school
4490540 i must have known more japanese than i know now i had a marvellous teacher who taught us these tricks to deconstruct a sentence almost tonally she managed to inculcate us with the ability to find the main stalk of a sentence
4490541 i was at harpercollins for nine years and before that at a literary agency i worked in the book trade for many years i was always a talker and a blabbermouth a very tiny child until right before i came to university when youre tiny what you have to bring to the world is conversation and i was always listened to i became that bullying listen to me kind of guy
4490542 essentially an american writer i had just gotten my green card and i wrote a piece for the about men page of the new york times
4490543 i wound up on this american life id heard david sedariss santa elf piece on the radio i wrote him a letter and we became friends his producer was a cub reporter named ira glass so i was in on the ground floor there
4490544 i wrote about sitting in barneys window impersonating sigmund freud
4490545 a midnight scavenger hunt a visit to the crafts department of martha stewart living magazine and doing a 20 day fast to see if i could find enlightenment
4490546 i go to the gym every day and exercise like an old jewish man i lift a few things i try my best
4490547 alone with an x acto knife and commercial grade adhesive i make stuff because i cant not make stuff
4490548 writing was always difficult writing is like pulling teeth from my dick
4490549 i got to be more present in my writing as the experiential i an enormous privilege not so easily conferred i really credit ira glass im not one of those writers who has notebooks filled with thoughts and drafts and such i wish i got in my own way a little bit less i get sidetracked im filled with self doubt
4490550 trying to advocate for something a little less memoir y a little more global in its scope
4490551 i have less hair im back to a kind of white knuckled homeostasis facing the blank page the bar feels a little higher
4490552 the world changed for us when bush was elected and changed again when he invaded iraq but since then it hasnt changed all that much its been a cavalcade of malfeasance more of the same bullshit
4490553 i dont want to go too far afield nature wise im really a city boy i want to go to a supermarket and the local art museums i dont have time to go to ayers rock it sounds hot and all i can think of is how excited i am at the prospect of wearing a sweater
4490554 id be doing much the same thing im a melancholic fellow but im a fairly happy guy im one of the luckiest people that i know i want one more room but thats about it id put in a laundry and have a room where i could do all sorts of work it doesnt take very much money to stop you thinking about money
4490555 i dont come up with an idea and try to fit the writers and their work into it
4490556 in 2006 there was an awful lot of publishing about the clash of civilisations in 2007 it dropped down a level to talk about the individual in relation to the society about values and ethical structures
4490557 this year its dropped another level to come down to two things mortality and personal stories how our life experiences make us what we are
4490558 looking back at their roots trying to figure out where their family fits in
4490559 people come for the names they know its what creates the buzz but they also expect surprise
4490560 the role of festivals is to showcase the celebrities but also to introduce new writers and open conversations on issues
4490561 weve pulled it off thanks to significant donors but we know that each year with all sponsorship and philanthropy theres an element of risk
4490562 the biggest problem with a lot of australian films is there are no ideas in them no great heroic gestures
4490563 this is partly because once youre working in australia youre restricted to australian novels the big agencies buy the rights to everything that comes out
4490564 a number of different people tried to get the project up but werent successful
4490565 i had to wait in a queue and i knew i was up against bigger guns
4490566 the book was so perfect i didnt want to bastardise it
4490567 i havent changed anything but the ending and that took a little bit of negotiating but coetzee was very generous
4490568 der hsv ist ein schwerer brocken aber wir werden alles daransetzen dass die hamburger am freitag erstmals in der allianz arena verlieren wir wollen positiv starten

4490571 ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem kader wir sind gut aufgestellt
4490572 i challenge anwar to swear according to islam that my allegations are not true
4490573 the incident happened without my consent this is not a political matter but a personal issue between me and anwar
4490574 he threw me up in the air like a football
4490575 because theres a black hand holding the camera editing inputting the translation sub titles
4490576 but when you see the video by younger members of the community it becomes intergenerational and the piece comes to reflect the lives of aboriginal people now
4490577 this report isnt about dumbing down it isnt about trivialising things
4490578 its about the breadth of visual imagery we are confronted with and engaging with in the world we live in which is heavily saturated with images
4490579 its about teaching kids to navigate interpret and control those images
4490580 its not an either or category if you like mozart you can also like amy winehouse or 50 cent we dont need to cast it as a battle between genres
4490581 were concerned to ensure that the entire school population is given the opportunity to develop those skills right the way through
4490582 imagine doing that in maths interrupting the continuity of learning
4490583 we should provide students all the way through to year 12 with the capacity to communicate visually and get rid of the notion its only for a talented few
4490584 it happened that her retrospective was on at the museum of applied arts in vienna
4490585 so we went along we met her and went to her country home but even before i spoke to her i had the idea for a music theatre piece and we talked about that
4490586 can you imagine the man who would let you build his house
4490587 and although i did plenty of concerts during that period after years of festival making there wasnt much spare time to get back to that emptiness that void that i feel you need for the creative process
4490588 when youve got a vomiting in tray its very hard to clear the brain and get on with truly original work
4490589 and as ive been saying in speeches ever after this is the greatest blessing any artist can have when someone with a budget comes to you and says do you want to play with us
4490590 i never ever know if anything i ever do do is any good ever
4490591 even doing a festival i never know until the brochures been published whether it looks any good what ive done it was only when we were casting only when i heard the words of architektin that i heard there was really value in them it came to life for me
4490592 why do actors continue to do shakespeare its because its incredibly challenging and on a good night you get 65 per cent right so you are always lusting over getting more right
4490593 many of those songs are like a chronology of what happened to people in that period and schutte lihotsky is a perfect example of that but if you just tell the story unadorned through song brecht eisler kurt weill friedrich hollander and those people you find a story of immense resilience or not
4490594 people who were in their 20s and 30s at the peak of their career having fantastic success and suddenly having to leave their country and try to keep their spirits alive somewhere else and whether to come back or not schutte lihotsky is in exactly the same bag
4490595 the reason im attracted to the songs is that when you do them today they are just deadly songs so politically vibrant too they havent lost any of their edge musically or lyrically
4490596 the only australian names missing from her list seem to be rolf harris dame edna everage and skippy
4490597 i decided to go and retrospectively it was a great decision the right thing to go at that time
4490598 i hope theyre having a very good year and that this signals a regeneration for the city but there were things that didnt suit me
4490599 its good to be getting out of the festival mill you do become addicted to that high energy i wouldnt discount doing another festival but the mix at the moment is fantastic
4490600 i might go to broome to mc at the matsuri ball
4490601 someone says do you want to direct a festival im like right on these days festival director is almost a career option but it wasnt then i thought you had to be an august presence it was a totally scary option i think constantly being asked to do scary things is something that i dont choose but if the option comes up i tend to have a no fear attitude the adrenalin pumps the lungs open im always better when im singing things start flowing
4490602 some handsome 20 something boy will come up and say look i had to go through my whole childhood listening to that song my mother played it all the time but theyre not at all resentful
4490603 so i probably have to admit that behind the scenes that may well be robyn archers greatest hit
4490604 i just live to stick a weed up the ass of snobs
4490605 as a kid my parents and teachers insisted i see quality films like picnic at hanging rock
4490606 then i saw this movie patrick about a telekinetic coma victim on commercial tv late one night and it thrilled excited and downright scared me just like the horror films made in the us but with our voices faces and places i didnt know we could do that
4490607 i have an interest in australian cinema overall we have such a diversity of films and its a shame more people dont know them
4490608 not been quite so tasteless i might have been ill
4490609 barry mckenzie alvin purple are merely surface reflections of a backward shift to uneducated attitudes a reversion to proletarian tribalism
4490610 the disruptive anarchic entertainment values of the cinema going public
4490611 in recent years too many filmmakers dont realise that art can include pleasure that isnt necessarily morally uplifting in the way that art cinema usually mandates
4490612 consistent support from the film finance corporation at a project level
4490613 its board continued to miss the cultural and commercial potential of the film
4490614 we had so many knockbacks and as months turned into years some of the older people we had lined up to interview like tim burstall passed away
4490615 the abc just didnt get it at least back then
4490616 every man under my command owes me 100 nazi scalps and yall will git me one hundred nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead nazis or die trying
4490617 this is pop culture encountering nazi germany and the holocaust with unprecedented force the effects of this collision are unpredictable
4490618 all the german historians and critics who were left gasping for breath by tom cruise and his worthy attempts to produce a correct image of stauffenberg they will be so shocked by inglorious bastards they will savage it on the spot
4490619 actors are treated with disrespect in this country but slowly they are starting to say give us a break
4490620 we were expecting this decision we were hoping for it
4490621 i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa
4490622 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4490623 all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa and those talks have all been pretty good
4490624 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4490625 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions
4490626 its such a great club and there is the chance to fight for the championship and win cups here when you join a club like rangers you cant expect anything but to win things
4490627 i know the game in england and the uk already so im already used to the british game
4490628 still using repossession as the first rather than last resort
4490629 that was a thrilling moment the more burials you do the more you get used to the mechanics of dealing with the remains but there is still a human context to your reaction
4490630 we are looking at the bones of an individual and you can see them as a whole person
4490631 i am in much better shape than that im really hard on myself though maybe its because its my first heptathlon of the year i have just not taken advantage of the situation

4490655 we wanted to investigate what was behind the observed sex differences in asthma rates and ar
4490656 this is the first study to prospectively examine the natural history of sex differences in asthma in this manner
4490657 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4490658 it will be of great interest to follow these children over time to see what happens with ar and severity of asthma in adulthood

4490662 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
4490663 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird

4490668 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies
4490669 this segregation of tumors into three groups with distinct expression patterns is surprising clearly the developmental trajectory provides a meaningful background for capturing large scale differences in gene expression across diverse conditions
4490670 shifting our focus from single sets of genes or processes to the biology of aggregates on the order of the entire transcriptome is likely to be useful in establishing highly robust molecular correlations between seemingly unrelated disease phenotypes

4490683 pidato kenegaraan itu adalah sesuatu yang disampaikan presiden berdasarkan sesuatu yang hasil hasilnya tercapai saat ini dan apa yang akan dilakukan pada 2009 jadi dimana kampanyenya
4490684 itulah fakta fakta yang disampaikan ada yang tercapai dan ada yang belum tidak ada kampanye
4490685 beliau memang bertekad pada waktu menjabat pada 2004 agar gaji pns itu secara bertahap dinaikkan sampai minimum gaji terendah rp2 juta dan itu memang sudah menjadi program pemerintah secara bertahap dinaikkan
4490686 data itu adalah betul betul akurat hasil survei bps jadi akurat kita tidak ingin menyampaikan data yang belum disurvei oleh bps
4490687 tadi dalam pidato juga disampaikan bahwa jika ukuran ukuran yang digunakan menggunakan ukuran bank dunia pun tetap angka kemiskinan kita turun dan ini capaian kita yang terbaik selama 10 tahun terakhir
4490688 jadi kenapa kita harus pelit menyampaikan syukur kita syukurilah angka angka itu untuk memacu semangat
4490689 saya melihat pidato presiden lebih ditujukan sebagai pidato kampanye daripada pidato kenegaraan semuanya bagus padahal kita tahu masih banyak masalah yang tertinggal
4490690 angka kemiskinan tahun ini adalah yang terendah baik besaran maupun prosentasenya
4490691 pidato presiden ini sangat defensif dan ditujukan untuk menepis tudingan rival rivalnya

4490700 australia at 10 per cent makes it tougher for local manufacturers in competing and drawing innovation and new technology to australia mr reuss said
4490701 we need to look at this on a fair playing field basis theres other countries out there that value their automotive industry greatly their tariffs reflect that

4490717 the draft regulation would define birth control as abortion it could deny access to critical family planning for women across the country
4490718 the draft rule could void laws in 27 states that require insurance companies to provide birth control coverage for women requesting it and laws in 14 states requiring that rape victims receive counseling and access to emergency day after contraceptives
4490719 the administration needs to stop playing word games with womens health and state clearly they will reject any regulations that will undermine womens access to basic health care

4490787 you shall not be afraid of the terrors of the night nor of the arrow the evil plots and slanders of the wicked that flies by day nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness nor of the destruction and sudden death that surprise and lay waste at noonday

4490798 right at this moment some 60 miles or less off the coast of key west florida china has the green light to drill for oil in order to lower energy costs in that country
4490799 china thanks to a lease issued by cuba is drilling for oil just 50 miles off floridas coast
4490800 even china recognizes that oil and natural gas is readily available off our shores thanks to fidel castro theyve been given a permit to drill for oil 45 miles from the florida keys

4490805 emergency was a black day and july 22 trust vote by the pm was a black day
4490806 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4490807 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4490808 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4490809 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4490810 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4490811 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did
4490812 u s dollar strength and weak commodity price action are keeping gold on its back foot without any sign of relief obviously ignoring the draw on supplies coming from michael phelpss olympic escapades
4490813 its a big sea change in everyones attitude to gold
4490814 gold had become a repository of funds that were betting on the dollar declining and the u s economy underperforming and as that view has changed everyones trying to get out
4490815 i think layoffs will be on the table and i think it will be a significant number although no specific number was thrown out
4490816 people are going to the suburbs because of the county sales tax increase and people are buying off the internet too
4490817 the implication was that i couldnt run because they want a woman candidate
4490818 i still strongly support stephane dion and liberal values and that hasnt changed
4490819 this was a personal thing and nothing to do with the liberals
4490820 it was important to make a clear decision now on whether i stay in local politics or go federal
4490821 if change is going to happen it will be at the local level and because sustainability is near and dear to me if i stay local i can be involved in effecting change
4490822 the quality has improved noticeably though not great it was still enjoyable the reviews which include standard m m novels and not just yaoi manga are written by average people like you would find on amazon only instead of stars its based on flavors of lube this may be a little crass but was funny none the less as was the yaoi crossword puzzle which is a nice feature i hope they keep and expand on in fact id love to see a word find or other such things
4490823 and id love to see a section on what is coming in yaoi such as new property licenses appearances of mangaka etc most of this information is available in press releases from the publishers and so can be incorporated here
4490824 i remember your submission were trying to incubate oel that isnt a direct reflection of japanese manga
4490825 trust me were quite aware of the difficulties in the oel industry which is why we go slowly pay for things as we go never collect money on products not already in hand and best of all dump 99 of the profits into improving with each endeavor we tackle
4490826 weve had some staff shake ups which has caused issue 3 to be delayed but it goes to the printer in a matter of days

4490829 georgia is to an extent the finland of today both morally and strategically
4490830 reincorporate old soviet areas into the kremlins sphere of control
4490831 if georgia no longer has its sovereignty it means not only that the west is cut off from the caspian sea and central asia but we can also assume that putin will exercise a similar strategy against ukraine if he faces resistance hes already publicly voiced threats against ukraine
4490832 targets with fantasy names as opposed to own names as well as those with funny e mail addresses and hotmail as provider were rated as more extraverted self enhancing aspects of e mail addresses influenced impressions of narcissism furthermore observer ratings indicated the usage of gender stereotypes targets that appeared to be female were rated as more neurotic open agreeable and conscientious
4490833 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4490834 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4490835 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4490836 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the next day when least expected
4490837 the first amendment does not allow people to be silenced because their speech exposes flaws even if those flaws might someday be illegally misused by others to protect our clients rights we had no choice but to ask the court to reconsider the gag order
4490838 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet

4490860 i really dont know i mean the shows are tested and the results are made public a vast majority of the time the guys are clean but occasionally theyre not i can tell you that the testing is real and at least in the u f c the fighters can be tested at any time
4490861 a lot of people lose sight of the bottom line this is a business its about making dollars by selling tickets pay per views and merchandise its up to the promoter to decide what is televised i just train hard then get in the octagon and fight

4490866 something existed before creation and that something was personal and not static the father loved the son there was a plan there was communication and promises were made prior to the creation of the heavens and the earth the whole conception is rooted in the reality of the trinity without the trinity christianity would not have the answers that modern man needs god could create by a free act of the will because before creation there was the father who loved the son and there was also the holy spirit to love and be loved

4490868 the fact is i can do anything but i chose to do this job
4490869 after high school things came up and i never got to join
4490870 i continued to earn more money as life moved progressively quicker the next thing i knew i blinked and it seemed as if time had flown by
4490871 i wanted to make sure my employees were taken care of after they were let go
4490872 so i took them to talk to a few military recruiters i wanted to make sure they had a job and got an education in the process i found out i was still under the age limit for joining the navy the cutoff age limit was 33 and i was 32 i was definitely interested and wanted to join
4490873 my employer was shocked when i told them i had just signed the paperwork to join the navy
4490874 they laughed and didnt believe me i pushed the paper in front of them to prove to them at the same time i realized i was walking away from my job and everything i had
4490875 at first i thought am i doing the right thing
4490876 i always tell people to live without regrets my regret was not joining the navy so i knew i had made the right decision if youre going to do something do it on your own terms
4490877 my dad and grandpa were in the marines my brother and one uncle were in the air force two of my uncles were in the army and two of my uncles were in the navy

4490880 no nation can afford to toy with its education sector because education is the bedrock of any meaningful development no serious country will handle the education sector with levity since the economy of the world is knowledge based
4490881 education will give you all the needed opportunities in life especially the education of a girl child who will surely impact positively on the entire family
4490882 you know we come from an area where they dont really believe in female education the way they would struggle to pay a boys school fees they wouldnt bother that much for girls because they believe she would soon get married and might forget the family
4490883 i really need this education because i want to be like one of these women who are being celebrated across the country i even intend to go for my masters degree after i get married

4490935 when my kids play in the road its like were in cape town our neighbours are from mitchells plain
4490936 we took issue with the original report in the cape argus because it edited out statistics which did not support the main angle of the story
4490937 the fact is that teachers have always left the profession for
4490938 what we are seeing now is not a new phenomenon but there may be some interesting new trends the international aspect open employment borders the new economic dispensation in south africa and therefore access to a whole new range of career options internal poaching by wealthy schools and where school governing body teachers seem to be
4490939 the issue is also global south africa is not the only country experiencing these problems and neither are the reasons for exiting the system unique to south africa
4490940 of concern was the shortage of teachers in specific disciplines like maths science and languages also an international phenomenon as well as the smaller numbers of young people enrolling for teaching
4490941 in general we can be assured the attrition levels we experience are
4490942 this was money from russian state budget which went through oil companies to estonian companies at the moment the relations between russia and estonia worsened the money flow ended

4490946 hes a great footballer and i hope he doesnt go everyone defends their interests and the player and the club have to reach an agreement

4490948 we feel we were a fraction short last year by not much
4490949 we want to show we can get the four points which made the difference last year between us and the winner
4490950 of course we have lost some players but we have also brought some players we opted for some stability
4490951 but because we have so many injuries i have to rush him a little bit
4490952 so compared to wednesday night nasri and kolo are back in the squad
4490953 every time we get belgians ordering we get whoa what a crazy name because its really flemish slang that weve got on the truck
4490954 symbolizes the way that the flemish are supporting the rest of the french speaking community
4490955 in belgium they quickly become attached to one or another territory
4490956 they are then surrounded by the publicity of being either a fleming or a walloon and in new york they do not have this feeling at all or much sure they still have a cultural identity but they feel they are belgians
4490957 its true that when we discuss the matter we can be passionate about it
4490958 but i dont have any animosity toward flemish speakers certainly not
4490959 if i was living in belgium that could be different
4490960 if we can make it in new york we can make it anywhere
4490961 one thing we share across the entire country is the food
4490962 thats one thing i never understood i dont know how we manage to get such good food
4490963 when we look at what is happening in belgium right now
4490964 we look at it as sort of a provincial fight thats removed from our community in new york but i still see flemish people sticking with flemish people
4490965 if i look at my walloon friends in new york
4490966 they dont speak flemish a few of them do but quite a few of them do not on the other hand pretty much every fleming speaks french
4490967 its just when youre hanging out with your friends you want to be able to speak the same language
4490968 its much easier to hang out with french speaking people
4490969 a country that was never supposed to be a country
4490970 teach in the uk travel europe select from a variety of temporary long term or permanent teaching roles
4490971 we do not ourselves support the active recruitment of new teachers to other countries
4490972 however we are not averse to young students getting the opportunity to spend a year or two in another country as this is an enriching and mostly impermanent experience
4490973 i would only work in south africa for two years to get experience then go overseas
4490974 the only reason why we are studying extra courses is to travel

4491084 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
4491085 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics

4491095 we have been creating infrastructures that are necessary to increase internal production we are completing roads for the transportation of goods and people and building energy and water supply networks that are also important
4491096 we are creating areas of investment in several provinces in the rural areas some projects will be financed by the state but there has to be more private investment i think that in the next two to three years there will be visible changes in production
4491097 there are old coffee plantations being revived in the centre and south of the country and rising investments in banana plantations like in benguela luanda and luanda sul
4491098 our goal today is not the same as in the 1970s we have to surpass those goals the situation is different and the population itself has increased
4491099 we are pushing for more companies to invest in the sector we will protect the self sufficient agriculture but we are also going to bet on big companies that introduce new technology

4491103 i probably wouldnt have noticed if they hadnt informed me
4491104 this time the sites been up but our shipping system is down its worse than it was in march were really backlogged
4491105 these costs could be offset by savings elsewhere either by buying less streaming content or spending less on marketing

4491128 shoaib malik enjoys the confidence and support of the selectors and he has satisfactory leadership qualities to motivate the team for producing good results
4491129 inzamam himself does not enjoy a good reputation as a captain as he made certain questionable decisions to taint the image of the country besides exhibiting his
4491130 attitude on certain occasions even at the time of selection ignoring talented misbah ul haq who was a potential threat to his middle order position
4491131 the biggest mistake made by inzamam as a captain was the forfeiting of the oval test in august 2006 which caused a lot of confusion and problems for pakistan cricket at highest level of the game then he inzamam imposed his will on selectors by including injured pacer shabbir ahmad on the tour of south africa in 2006 and even threatened to come back from the same tour

4491139 hes played for real madrid he must have something about him and by all accounts he did okay at gosport the other night
4491140 i know it is crass to ask for patience from supporters bearing in mind the phenomenal loyalty that was shown to us last season
4491141 but it is important that the new players are given time to bed in and prove their worth i believe we have great quality and tremendous character in the dressing room and all the ingredients to have a successful season

4491186 the aberdeen report confirms what shavliks customers already know that critical tasks such as vulnerability assessment patch management and configuration management continue to be complex and time consuming essentially if security management is too difficult and resource intensive it doesnt get done and therefore the organization is ultimately putting their network at risk leading organizations understand that there is value in investing in technologies to automate these complicated and resource intensive tasks
4491187 our customers continue to validate that the shavlik security suite provides a single easy to manage solution for automating the vulnerability management lifecycle resulting in stronger security higher service levels and on demand proof of policy compliance
4491188 the explosive growth in the number of threats and vulnerabilities to internet facing networks computers and application software simultaneously demonstrates two things the extreme cleverness and resourcefulness and also the unfortunate greed and depravity of human nature
4491189 companies should accept that vulnerability management is a never ending process and that the cycle of

4491200 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4491201 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4491202 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life

4491220 los escasos 32 3 millones de euros efectivos que la generalitat pone encima de la mesa para agricultura y a la formaci n del peque o comercio no solo no reponen lo que la consellera maritina hern ndez reclama de ayudas otorgadas que exceden en 900 000 euros lo que les va a proporcionar este a o
4491221 ambas cantidades provienen de nuevas aportaciones del estado y que el consell ha dado de alta en la ltima modificaci n de cr dito
4491222 genere ilusiones infundadas con nuevas aportaciones de capitales que no se corresponden con la realidad
4491223 de los 32 3 millones de euros reales solo 25 6 corresponden a nuevas aportaciones del consell pese a que ha recibido entre el gobierno de espa a y la ue m s de 100 millones inesperados en sus presupuestos de los que destina la mitad a pagar intereses de su deuda y demora de pagos
4491224 en su versi n inicial el trazado discurr a a una altura de unos siete metros sobre el nivel del terreno permitiendo el paso debajo de la plataforma tanto de la vieja carretera de entrada a alcasser como del nuevo eje silla picassent
4491225 y pese a la oposici n de los municipios afectados
4491226 pero a cambio de sustituir los enlaces entre ambas poblaciones desde la previsi n inicial a ras del terreno lo hizo por un nuevo perfil mucho m s elevado hasta alcanzar una cota de m s de once metros sobre el terreno natural
4491227 a la barrera trasversal del ave se le suman dos barreras longitudinales da ando irreversiblemente el paisaje de esa zona del rea metropolitana e introduciendo una soluci n con graves problemas funcionales tanto para veh culos como para los abundantes peatones que se desplazan entre las poblaciones citadas dada su gran cercan a

4491229 dichos veh culos deber n de acceder a trav s de una rotonda elevada a once metros de altura con unas rampas de acceso muy estrictas para dicho tipo de tr fico que podr an crear incluso situaciones de peligrosidad vial
4491230 pese a los reiterados intentos del ayuntamiento de alcasser y de la generalitat por darle una soluci n m s acorde a los accesos a tres municipios con una poblaci n conjunta de m s de 30 000 habitantes la empresa p blica del ministerio de fomento ha rechazado cualquier alternativa y est desarrollando las obras seg n la soluci n que en este caso ha impuesto tanto a los ayuntamientos como a la administraci n auton mica

4491238 too many people have lied in the name of christ for anyone to heed the call so many people have died in the name of christ that i cant believe it all

4491250 were very eager to have framingham state become an important part of the fabric of the community
4491251 its a very difficult time for middle class families thinking about higher education
4491252 in the 21st century nations must not simply invade other nations to expand their reach or sphere of influence
4491253 we went through and scoured the information student by student building by building
4491254 during that window of time we received designations for ayp based on those preliminary test results
4491255 the real problem is the high stakes nature of no child left behind i am becoming more and more convinced that standardized testing does not prove what it should about student learning
4491256 we actually take that information isat scores and use it to try to figure out where gaps in student learning are happening where we have to strengthen our instruction
4491257 we really cant do anything we have to wait for accurate results
4491258 its more than a state issue if the federal government is going to intrude into public education then they need to give states the tools to implement the plans
4491259 its to create this awareness that nude sunbathers are just about nude activities as opposed to weird creeps on craigslist shaggin in the bushes you know
4491260 he says he will always tell the truth and hes lied about his age and hes running on traditional family values and while he was still married
4491261 misguided and untrue view of sexuality whereby a woman with a dildo is seen as liberated strong and independent while a man with a blow up plastic vagina is viewed as disgusting and perverted
4491262 if future generations are to remember us with gratitude rather than contempt we must leave them something more than the miracles of technology we must leave them a glimpse of the world as it was in the beginning not just after we got through with it

4491265 only very large enterprises could afford it and it was hard to justify paying those prices for a product that simply automated what developers could already do for themselves with free tools
4491266 when i go into sites i would love to turn them on to the benefits of the testng test framework
4491267 but most organizations do so little unit testing if any that i stick with the simple well known xunit tools so as not to create confusion most organizations are just not ready to learn anything more than basic unit testing if that
4491268 the problem with unit testing is that it increases the cost of development before you know whether what you developed is what you needed afterward when you have a working solution theres little interest in writing unit tests as what you have works and your management wants you to move on
4491269 many developers and managers mistakenly think that by cutting testing they well get feature x out faster what they dont realize is that you are robbing peter to pay paul

4491289 i had been suffering from a persistent cough for a couple of weeks and was feeling a little run down so my wife suggested we take a short break and visit the vatican city

4491291 on arriving apart from my cough all was well and we wandered around the city seeing the sites
4491292 however after a few hours i felt terribly unwell and i knew i needed medical treatment

4491294 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4491295 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4491296 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4491297 instead of getting full moral and political support in the struggle against real aggression and ethnic cleansing we have heard a mass of unpleasant words and threats that will of course not strengthen our relations
4491298 it can now be expected that this will be the beginning of the end of polish russian talks

4491331 each time you dare to let go and surrender one of these many fears your hands opens a little and your palms spread out in a gesture of receiving you must be patient of course very patient until your hands are completely open
4491332 there were many mercenaries from ukraine and the baltic states we have found dead bodies of african americans too

4491336 it was the dual informational and armed aggression some were wielding guns whereas others were armed with microphones and cameras
4491337 there will be only russian peacemakers deployed in south ossetia and abkhazia

4491339 task force ramadi has been a breath of fresh air
4491340 the programs are a lot more focused and we are starting to see the tangible results of their efforts
4491341 its been my experience that military officers can easily make that transition from a military role to a diplomatic role
4491342 the military officers exist in an environment that is results orientated and they bring that to the table we would not have been as effective without their participation
4491343 gas is no longer a limiting factor holding back the growth of the economy
4491344 security and construction are the two most significant improvements in the past six months
4491345 more than two thousand jobs have opened up and we have more than one thousand people enrolled in training programs to improve their role in the growing job market
4491346 shops are bulging with retail goods and you can see a growth in the demand for electricity
4491347 what we bring to the table is expertise and cash
4491348 the cash gives us a seat at the table and allows us to use our expertise to assist them in developing their future

4491380 we are definitely focusing on the jatropha plant for oil production
4491381 enable more kenyans to enjoy and derive comfort from the supply of bio diesel for agricultural production employment creation rural urban balance and blending in the motor vehicle industry
4491382 research trials in mpeketoni lamu a coastal town where there is no power have shown people using the little oil they got from the seeds to light their lamps
4491383 the effect of deforestation and degradation as well as serving as carbon sink
4491384 the use of marginal land ensures that the high potential areas are not converted to energy production areas and therefore it guards against competition between biofuels and food production
4491385 we use a lot of diesel in the factory sometimes we pollute the environment we were looking for an alternative to cut costs
4491386 it is too cold here the rate of growth is lower the results will be belated
4491387 in 2006 a kilo seeds went for 1000 shillings us 15 today half a kilo of seeds goes for 3000 shillings 46 its very expensive

4491420 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4491421 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4491505 the u s made the same announcement earlier thursday about the exercise scheduled to begin aug 20 and it is clearly an attempt by the two countries to bring some pressure to bear on the soviets for their actions in georgia
4491506 based on that type of aggressive behaviour we will not participate in the exercise

4491530 no covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
4491531 investigations and hearings will only distract from what we want to accomplish
4491532 know my son with how little wisdom the world is governed
4491533 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
4491534 government is at a stand little better practiced now than three or four thousand years ago
4491535 our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington d c but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we the people want
4491536 and what we want by and large is this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods we want to be able to pump gas into our cars regardless of how big they may happen to be and we want to be able to do these things without having to think about whether or not the books are balanced at the end of the month or the end of the fiscal year
4491537 one of the ways we avoid confronting our refusal to balance the books is to rely increasingly on the projection of american military power around the world to try to maintain this dysfunctional system or set of arrangements that have evolved over the last 30 or 40 years
4491538 i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat compromised our freedom of action how every president from richard nixon down declared were going to fix the problem but none of them did
4491539 the clearest statement of what i value is found in the preamble to the constitution there is nothing in the preamble to the constitution which defines the purpose of the united states of america as remaking the world in our image which i view as a fools errand i believe that the framers of the constitution were primarily concerned with focusing on the way we live here the way we order our affairs to try to ensure that as individuals we can have an opportunity to pursue our perhaps differing definitions of freedom but also so that as a community we could live together in some kind of harmony and that future generations would also be able to share in those same opportunities with the current crisis in american foreign policy unless we do change our ways the likelihood that our children our grandchildren the next generation is going to enjoy the opportunities that weve had is very slight because were squandering our power we are squandering our wealth
4491540 the congress especially with regard to matters related to national security policy has thrust power and authority to the executive branch we have created an imperial presidency the congress no longer is able to articulate a vision of what is the common good the congress exists primarily to ensure the reelection of members of congress
4491541 has made our democracy a false one were going through the motions of a democratic political system but the fabric of democracy i think really has worn very thin
4491542 was a fundamental mistake it never should have been undertaken and were never going to do this kind of thing again
4491543 be the moment when we look ourselves in the mirror and see what we have become and perhaps undertake an effort to make those changes in the american way of life that will enable us to preserve for future generations that which we value most about the american way of life

4491545 95 percent of female suicide attacks occurred within the context of a military campaign against occupying forces
4491546 the main motives and circumstances that drive female suicide attackers are quite similar to those that drive men
4491547 is mainly a demand driven not a supply limited phenomenon
4491548 i think al qaeda has discovered that because a great job has been done they just cannot drive their vbieds vehicle borne improvised explosive devises like they used to we see an adjustment that is the suicide vest attack

4491558 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4491559 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4491560 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4491574 just because theyre pretty much household names it doesnt mean their it department is completely organized
4491575 some have a very good quality assurance department others have a very good development organization but that doesnt mean everything is moving along in a precise fashion
4491576 for a long time the approach was lets just throw some code together because all these new languages like c and java were coming out and they were supposed to make development easier
4491577 enterprises fell victim to the false promises of the web making things easier
4491578 it did but it also made things far more complex you need more system integration use cases and testing
4491579 if an artist cant paint any more does he ask someone else to do it for him of course not and its the same with a keen gardener
4491580 we spent all our time in the garden and loved every moment it was never a chore because we were always planning for it to be even better next season indeed our last year there was the best ever
4491581 john and i were simply not prepared to sit back and watch someone else do the gardening for us so we decided to leave on a high and move up the road in fact it was so close that we were able to move some of our favourite plants there by wheelbarrow
4491582 i just love getting out in the fresh air and digging most of us have always had gardens and the itch is still with us and you simply cant beat fresh vegetables
4491583 until recently older residents of the vera lynn and mantovani generation considered central heating and fitted carpets as luxuries now for the baby boomer beatles and rolling stones era customers have higher aspirations
4491584 we are pleased if they wish to join in the rule is only if you want to but many do
4491585 i dont know what i would do without my allotment here it has been a life saver for me and gives a great sense of well being most of our allotment holders are well into their 70s and 80s and we have one 90 year old who still does all her own digging
4491586 we are out here all year round weather and daylight permitting sometimes we do rather more talking than working but its a great social life here exchanging plants and ideas
4491587 the allotment is easier than a garden because vegetables require less attention than lawns and flower beds we enjoy growing our own produce and do only as much work as we want to do if im not in the mood i dont feel guilty if i leave it unattended for a day or two
4491588 most of our residents are extremely active enjoying both the leisure facilities we provide and continuing their interest in gardening the urge to potter in the garden doesnt diminish and we think the small private areas that we provide at most of our cottages are the right size to be manageable without becoming a burden or a tie
4491589 i had a sort of road to damascus experience not long ago when i visited one of our customers and saw for myself what he had achieved in the relatively small garden it was the most spectacular display of plants i had seen and it made me realise that manageable gardens and outdoor space are vitally important to retirees of all ages

4491592 we have exclusive photographic evidence pictures videos hard proof to further incriminate edwards he doesnt at this point know what we have which is why im asking that we dont reveal too much yet and which we will use unless and until he acknowledges paternity
4491593 in 1990 when mrs thatcher was prime minister the human fertilization and embryology act discriminated against the disabled by allowing disabled babies for the very first time to be aborted right up to full term my question is if in power would you favour measures to reverse this discrimination by giving unborn children who are disabled the same protection under the law as currently enjoyed by all other children
4491594 a short answer first then a longer one my personal view about that is no i think abortion votes and votes on embryology and votes on all of those things should be free votes they are matters of conscience and on the last embryology bill weve just had i pushed very hard if you remember the prime minister wanted to have whipped votes like they had whipped votes in the house of lords and i said this is wrong this is a conscience issue this is one where mps have got to examine their consciences listen to their constituents and explain their positions and it should always be a free vote so it should always be a free vote my own view is yes i think that we should change the abortion limit down from 24 towards 20 weeks i voted that way and i think it would be right to do that but in the case of parents who have medical evidence that they may have a very disabled child i would not want to change that and i speak as someone i mean ive got a six year old boy who is severely disabled has cerebral palsy and is quadriplegic and hes a sweet boy hes a lovely boy ivan and you know it is though incredibly tough bringing up disabled children and i dont want to kind of put myself in the position of saying to other parents youve got to go ahead and have that child or you cant have an abortion or you can do this or you cant do that personally ivan hes brought incredible things to my life but it is an enormous challenge and i dont think its right to sort of tell other parents if you hear that youve got a very disabled child on the way that actually doing something about it isnt an option thats my view
4491595 if we give them accents it doesnt matter that the script sucks

4491600 ohare expansion is more than two years behind schedule and the city is at least 300 million short of the money needed to complete the 3 2 billion first phase and the airlines say they are in no position to help play for the vital second phase of the 15 billion project which would provide the biggest gains in airport capacity
4491601 privately the airlines say its only a matter of time until the city acknowledges it must scale back the project
4491602 ohare air traffic controllers say the southern runway is the most important element of the project and should have been built first along with jettisoning other parts that add to the cost but dont significantly help expand flights
4491603 but in light of the financial challenges confronting the airlines and the economy it may take years to build the southern runway if it ever is built

4491607 a recent admission by chicago police spokesperson monique bond underscores the role that police policy and actions play in inadvertently stimulating more frequent and fierce gang violence in chicago
4491608 the zeal with which the chicago police department has gone after street corner gangs in the past has according to spokesperson bond contributed greatly to the increase in deadly violence
4491609 im so angry that i dont know where to direct my anger ive fervently supported obamas campaign up until now having just donated to his campaign again last week but im not sending him another dime until i see some evidence that hes willing to take a principled stand against this kind of bigotry if obama wont stand up to the flimsiest of accusations linking someone in his campaign however remotely and ridiculously to terrorists then im not sure what hell stand up against i realize this kind of feckless approach worked so well for michael dukakis and john kerry barack but could you act like a man for once and grow a pair maybe hillary will lend you hers

4491732 we are completely dependent on the commercial banks someone has to borrow every dollar we have in circulation cash or credit if the banks create ample synthetic money we are prosperous if not we starve we are absolutely without a permanent money system when one gets a complete grasp of the picture the tragic absurdity of our hopeless position is almost incredible but there it is it is the most important subject intelligent persons can investigate and reflect upon it is so important that our present civilization may collapse unless it becomes widely understood and the defects remedied soon
4491733 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

4491740 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds
4491741 how did it come about that highly sensitive technical information was given to the chinese why did the president ignore the national security experts who counseled against this deal what damage has been done to our national security
4491742 lone ranger work has taken him dangerously close to the neighborhood of what we used to call treason
4491743 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media
4491744 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
4491745 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
4491746 a nosotros nos corresponde ahora demostrar a los rebeldes nuestra determinaci n de ser libres si salimos derrotados la pr xima generaci n levantar en alto la ikurri a y continuar la batalla por la libertad que nosotros iniciamos

4491748 she was holding the flashlight while i was turning a bolt
4491749 the tool i had wasnt big enough and i was coming up i saw a shadow something hit the car which snapped the car jack
4491750 when we first got there we first thought her whole head was caved in
4491751 there was a lot of damage to the right side of her face and it was pretty well peeled off
4491752 when they arrested me i was praying and crying in my jail cell for two hours
4491753 it looked like she was missing her eye after the scene cleared out the paramedics came through again looking for her eye
4491754 i wish he was the guy who lived across the street from me
4491755 well be sure to honor him at our honor ceremony and give him a citizen award
4491756 in most districts it will be a very small amount of money
4491757 but its going to be a reflection of what we will see in savings
4491758 the sprinkler systems are designed to hold the fire in check until we get there
4491759 later down the line maybe the state could provide a little bit of funds
4491760 some districts would be more financially able to do it than others
4491761 hes a master at giving other people credit for what he is making happen
4491762 does an outstanding job as will county farm bureau manager
4491763 he goes out of his way to try to work with ag teachers and ag education programs in the county to get teachers involved and trying every way he can to promote ag education
4491764 1 300 to 1 400 third and fourth graders to learn where their food comes from
4491765 we host several programs a year for teachers to learn what resources are available to them in ag education hes the real driving force behind all of that
4491766 im always in there representing agriculture making sure its interests are heard
4491767 i really look on it as a will county award because if the farm bureau board doesnt allow me to serve these things might not happen
4491768 you think of kites in the traditional way with one string but some of these are controlled with four lines and can stop on a dime
4491769 it hasnt been fun to be in the minority it isnt fun to not have the governors house and all the other constitutional offices
4491770 why on earth would anybody vote for a democrat in this state in the next election
4491771 i think its easier to come together because we dont control anything
4491772 democrats control everything and then they have power struggles like whos the alpha donkey
4491773 weve seen a democratic administration that has been totally inept really everything was there for them to do their bidding because of power struggles theyve really messed things up
4491774 i think you just need to continue to be vocal on what the minority party stands for and people will resonate to it
4491775 opportunity for talent of any and all types to gain performing experience in front of a receptive audience recreate a number performed in some other show or try something someone has always wanted to do

4491842 that was an interesting programme in one scene the cellist and a sort of hungarian composer zolt n kod ly are seen together with their great granddaughters at least thats what one supposes until one learns tat they are their wives and what were the two racy octogenarians talking about well they were saying that the trouble with me is that i must always be doing the latest thing but who are they to talk when they have been doing the same old thing for at least eighty years se or casals also offered us an interesting insight into his philosophy for example playing bach in the style of brahms

4491846 we always dreamed of designing an rts and when wii ware came out we immediately figured that this was our chance
4491847 el empleo de estas municiones por rusia no s lo resulta mortal para los civiles sino que tambi n supone un insulto para los esfuerzos internacionales por evitar una cat strofe humanitaria global similar a las consecuencias del empleo de minas antipersonas
4491848 las bombas de racimo son un arma de asesinato indiscriminado y est n prohibidas por la mayor a de pa ses
4491849 no hemos empleado bombas de aviaci n de racimo no fue necesario
4491850 estamos en contra de la prohibici n total de las municiones de racimo y de las minas antipersona y a favor de la evoluci n de esos armamentos
4491851 um wont the baby slide down the ball and hit its head
4491852 well from the tv ads i always got the impression that cute little hetero families love frozen pizzas and brightly colored sugared breakfast cereals and pringles and kool aid
4491853 and all that time mommy was trying to feed us tofu lettuce and fruits
4491854 it represents the pinnacle in a series of large and innovative u s electric utility solar projects that have been announced in the last six months
4491855 there is still less than one tenth of one percent solar which means theres plenty of room for growth
4491856 so theres going to be a need for both thin film and silicon pv
4491857 right now applied materials is ramping up eight new manufacturing plants four of which are doing thin film solar
4491858 it is a new scale especially in the u s now if we could get some tax credits it would be great
4491859 i appreciate your valuable effort at consolidating very up to date information
4491860 es geht darum dass man den anderen auf negative vielleicht auch l cherliche umst nde aufmerksam macht die er tagt glich lebt ohne ihn dabei zu verletzen

4491862 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4491863 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4491864 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4491865 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4491866 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4491867 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4491868 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4491869 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4491870 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4491871 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4491872 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4491873 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4491874 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4491875 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4491876 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4491877 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4491878 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4491879 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4491880 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4491881 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4491882 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4491883 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4491884 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4491885 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4491886 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4491887 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4491888 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4491889 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4491890 if you cant reach you toes use the band to pull yourself forward
4491891 nothing to kill of die for and no religion too
4491892 may be viewed as a criticism of an anti religious message represented in the sound recording and in general
4491893 el despliegue de nuevas fuerzas de defensa antimisil en europa tiene como objetivo a la federaci n de rusia y han elegido para ello el momento adecuado

4491910 a ning n partido nacionalista o no se le puede reducir su presencia por la v a de modificar las leyes
4491911 mi criterio es que sin nimo de revancha se averiguara la verdad por completo para honrar a los muertos y para que nunca m s pueda repetirse un accidente de esa naturaleza por las mismas causas que aquel se ocasion
4491912 ahora se sabe mucho m s de lo que se sab a
4491913 lo que hice fue averiguar una verdad que cuando llegu al ministerio hab a sido ocultada y lo hice porque me lo pidieron las familias de los que hab an muerto cuyos cad veres les hab an sido entregados con falsedad y hasta hubo que desenterrarlos proclam lo que he hecho y volver a a hacer es ayudar a los familiares a conocer la verdad

4491937 it was not easy for he is the world champion but once i levelled the score i knew i cannot lose
4491938 its not possible to assure you of the gold but i can tell you that im here to win only gold
4491939 i know things would not be easier in fact it would get even more difficult from now onwards but im here to do my job and return with the gold if luck decides the outcome i may return with the bronze but if confidence is the determining factor gold is mine
4491940 only akhil can do that he was all along confident and he proved that it was not mere wishful thinking on his part we are so proud of him
4491941 the job however is not done yet even though the win would fill him with more confidence trailing 2 6 few would have come out winner but he managed that he is supremely confident and knows what he is going to do

4491959 jewish identity in the past has been locked into the holocaust experience a german burden that the jews have not been able to shed
4491960 the jewish identity in the future appears bleak any nation that remains anchored to the past is unable to move ahead and especially a nation that believes its survival can only be ensured by weapons and bombs in tel aviv in 2004 i had the opportunity to speak to some members of parliament and peace activists all of whom argued that the wall and the military build up was necessary to protect the nation and the people in other words i asked you believe that you can create a snake pit with many deadly snakes in it and expect to live in the pit secure and alive what do you mean they countered well with your superior weapons and armaments and your attitude towards your neighbors would it not be right to say that you are creating a snake pit how can anyone live peacefully in such an atmosphere would it not be better to befriend those who hate you
4491961 i was surprised and deeply disappointed by arun gandhis recent opinion piece in the washington post blog on faith
4491962 in particular i vehemently disagree with his singling out of israel and the jewish people to blame for the
4491963 i think its shameful that a peace institute would be headed up by a bigot
4491964 one would hope that the grandson of such an illustrious human being would be more sensitive to jewish history
4491965 was couched in language that was hurtful and contrary to the principles of nonviolence
4491966 but my sympathy does not blind me to the requirements of justice the cry for the national home for the jews does not make much appeal to me the sanction for it is sought in the bible and the tenacity with which the jews have hankered after return to palestine
4491967 palestine belongs to arabs in the same sense that england belongs to the english or france to the french

4491973 meaningful statehood israels defeat by hezbollah in 2006 a tipping point
4491974 for the publics harsh feeling of fracture and disappointment from the results of the war and its conduct by the political and military echelon
4491975 fact that israel initiated it the war had complete air superiority and the strongest army in the middle east
4491976 ended without israel winning it from a military point of view
4491977 they didnt know what hezbollah had how it had built up what it was capable of
4491978 the concept of dismantling or eliminating hezbollah is fatally flawed from the very start hezbollah is an organic part of that 40 percent of the lebanese population that is shia
4491979 theres nothing to compare with the israeli defense force in the mideast
4491980 theyve got a lot of very smart people these are not a bunch of wild eyed fanatics
4491981 theyve always been willing to try to broaden the dialogue quietly i can guarantee you that they would have welcomed a quiet dialogue with the united states and they have repeatedly said they have no great quarrel with the united states
4491982 we must get army deployments down to 12 months as soon as possible people are tired
4491983 this war in iraq is the most important liberal revolutionary u s democracy building project since the marshall plan it is one of the noblest things this country has ever attempted abroad
4491984 propaganda brought us to power propaganda has since enabled us to remain in power and propaganda will give us the means of conquering the world the task of the propagandist is not the scientific education of everyone but the indication to the masses of the facts events necessities etc whose significance and morality enter into the field of interest

4491986 at least 532 separate speeches briefings interviews testimonies and more provide the evidence
4491987 the study cites 232 false bush statements alone about wmds and 28 others about links to al qaeda
4491988 how to get people to vote against their interests and to really think against their interests is very clever its the cleverest ruling class that i have ever come across in history its been 200 years at it its superb

4491991 the united states cannot achieve its goals in the middle east unless it deals directly with the arab israeli conflict and regional instability there must be a renewed and sustained commitment by the united states to a comprehensive arab israeli peace on all fronts lebanon syria and president bushs june 2002 commitment to a two state solution for israel and palestine this commitment must include direct talks with by and between israel lebanon palestinians those who accept israels right to exist and syria
4491992 the united states is in the beginning of a period of relative decline
4491993 as global stock markets went wild last week financial commentators resurrected an old metaphor about infectious diseases of the upper respiratory system
4491994 when the united states sneezes does the world catch a cold
4491995 all this means that the political and economic clout of the west and centrally of the united states is waning
4491996 on the american campaign trail the candidates talk about a world utterly unrelated to the one that is actually being created on the ground
4491997 global confidence in the us economy has reached zero as was proved by last months stock market meltdown
4491998 as a result going into 2008 the united states finds itself in the anomalous position of being unable to pay for its own elevated living standards or its wasteful overly large military establishment

4492001 the cult of violence ceases it would unravel mother natures gamble on homo sapiens with its domination of the earth very short in zoological time apart from reversing the heedless rush of consumerism to stop the hemorrhaging of mother earths finite resources and harming the environment the world must turn away from the unidirectional and nihilistic western thought i think and there fore i am and darwins theory of evolution that mutations cause species to change at random and the fittest survives and not lamarcks theory that species change because they make determined effort to change cartesian thought and darwin theory drove the homo sapiens evolution towards its animal nature it has played havoc in human history survival of the fittest theory brought in colonialism imperialism and cultural orientalism west also evolved divisive nationalism marxism ideological totalitarianism capitalism and globalization for these causes and ideologies many scores millions of human beings were butchered in the most violent of all the 20th century and the carnage continues west now believes that there is nothing superior to human rational knowledge in greek philosophy the idea of unwritten laws exists which live always and forever and no man knows from where they have arisen

4492004 sometimes she would do two in a row and that is a very difficult thing extremely tiring and exhausting
4492005 it was a great performance but it was so heartbreaking for shawn i could see how disappointed she was
4492006 ive said this before many times its really dangerous to be the it girl the year before the olympics on the one hand you have the enormous publicity and the endorsement money the other side of the sword are the expectations and pressure
4492007 the difference was a small slip on my grip on the high bar
4492008 but in most cases if you go against the athletic types the athletic types win mary lou retton carly patterson those types beat out longer lankier athletes who cant stick the landings like mighty mites history shows the shawn johnson type athlete usually wins because the scoring system rewards the athlete

4492035 the difficulty we have in cases like this is that the children who are targeted may go with the offenders willingly not recognising the potential risk to their safety
4492036 it is an offence for an adult to take a child without consent from a parent or guardian and we will pursue a prosecution against anyone who does this

4492048 they get the least amount of girls and they dont make any money
4492049 the guys thought that i had set it up that i had either stolen the stuff myself and pawned the two guitars or had someone else do it so that i could get drugs
4492050 they left me there on the street with no money i had a calling card with two minutes left on it i called the friend id stayed with in the bay area and with the remaining time left i called a girl in belgium that i knew and with some persuading she got me a flight there
4492051 i was just i wanted to feel different i dunno it was exciting to me anything im not supposed to do im going to do instantly
4492052 my bedroom door was like five inches thick with all this insulating fabric on the wall i got a knife and just cut the whole room apart one time
4492053 i must have been 12 years old and the word i had to draw was high i had once seen a picture of john lennon with a spoon and heroin or coke and i drew a picture of that and all the kids were like what is that and i said its a nose with drugs get high and i got in
4492054 all the parents everyone was like what the fuck is wrong with this kid and i was like it just seemed cool you know rock and roll i guess i was a little young for things like that but i wanted to be different from everybody
4492055 daniel shouldnt have homework as he spends all day there he should not have to work he should be able to play
4492056 i was never able to have any close friends because i was always going to a different school because of whatever was going on in my life i went to six high schools everywhere from los angeles to the valley to up north in marin county different places where everyone was already friends with everybody since they were six years old or whatever everyone was really mean and teases you because youre english and youre just like fuck fuck these people im not here for your fucking entertainment
4492057 it didnt really make sense to me when i later discovered that his dad was pretty famous
4492058 and he was living like he was i would have expected him to be pretty wealthy but he was poorer than me and id been a drug addict for a long time i got help here and there but i got to the point where no one was going to help me because i was just going to spend it and snort it
4492059 my mom was like you guys should try to go to rehab
4492060 i was like i dont know but then one night i would burp and this liquid would come out of my mouth and i just couldnt drink any more and instead of feeling good i just felt really bad this wasnt working for me anymore i had 76 cents and i threw everything i had into this little hatchback i had to reason with rich that we needed to go because we couldnt do anything anymore we werent in a band we werent practicing no anything it was pretty pathetic my dad was like you guys have got to get out of here im going to back to england you cant stay here so there we were with no money and nowhere to live it was a choice between being homeless and rehab and since rehab looked like a place to live we made that decision
4492061 i guess that year long is still the mistress at this time
4492062 its a bit of a problem in that both are working very hard right now
4492063 third eye blind had performed as the kinks on a show called american dreams
4492064 and six months later im there in glendale i was intrigued by the fact that i had just played kinks songs on tv and now i was opening up so to speak for daniel davies that was interesting but more than anything when i saw them play my jaw dropped
4492065 daniel hadnt been out of los angeles since he was in high school and my feeling is that you have to play all the little shitholes across the country in order to find out if youre worth your salt you can sit here and suspect that you might have something cool but you have to see what happens when youre in say baltimore
4492066 what i wanted was to get in a band with guys that kind of know more than me so they can push me i knew that i had something going on but i didnt really have any direction i never really had any direction throughout my life so i was like i need a band with some guys who know whats going on and if i know that theyre the best at what they do then i think ill be able to do whatever i want
4492067 there was a night when we listened to percy by the kinks the soundtrack to the 1971 cult flick about a man undergoing a penis transplant daniel put it on for me and it just sounded so organic that was strange because when youre really high all the time like i was and especially if its crack youre not really listening and you cant really focus on anything for more than 15 seconds you dont want to do anything but that was kind of the start of making music again
4492068 i was pretty shocked and surprised that an investigation was going on
4492069 though willie nelson has recorded a happy song about gay cowboys
4492070 and if you listen to my earlier works you can see that ive honed my craft like any artisan striving for her best
4492071 im a capricorn and capricorns dont believe in anything that isnt backed up by scientific proof my religion is to harness the blood boiling fire that generates inside any human during such activities as war altruistic love and orgasm
4492072 the protagonist is standing as a lightning rod to protect his or her love even at the expense of possessing human form
4492073 i just like to listen to sounds of all types including anything you might find during your typical day whether it be organic mechanical or the sounds of people laughing talking crying etc i think though im not sure that listening to the structure and random configurations of these sounds is what sets the tone for how i record my own experiences through words and music
4492074 metal is great for a quick spin on the turntable but noise bands can go all night
4492075 i have tried to explain my obsession with george jones before and it always sounds patronizing
4492076 just suffice to say i can listen to his songs hundreds of times and they still rip me up
4492077 we feel very comfortable sending people to foreign hospitals that we know where we know the doctors and know exactly whats going on
4492078 we have for many years had a program in place where if a person is interested in repatriation we work with them to do that
4492079 is really the driving force parental consent and our interest in having them back home if there are medically suitable facilities in their home place so we work with them and with the consulate
4492080 almost all of the time we discuss this with patients and it works out fine because they want to go home
4492081 sometimes it doesnt and thats where we run into difficult situations we handle those on a case by case basis
4492082 im an immigration lawyer and even i had never heard of such a thing i think its happening quite a lot under the radar and it sounds very devious and un american it just doesnt comport with the principles of our country
4492083 so we feel very comfortable sending people to hospitals that we know where we know the doctors and know exactly whats going on when we go further afield of course we do depend upon the consulates after all they are the legal representatives of the immigrants while theyre in this country
4492084 weve never had a situation where we have physically taken anybody down weve had people that arent happy about it but once they realize that this is the way it is they agree to go
4492085 our interest is that the individual get the care they need and we try to find that for them
4492086 we were looking for books trying to find a source of inspiration
4492087 nick wantland the groups drummer stumbled upon this book that we had in our house it was called an index of possibilities energy and power its pretty much about everything and we found this article on ed mitchell
4492088 when mitchell saw the earth from so far away he called it instant global awareness seeing the world as a whole community as opposed to small communities and he experienced a kind of depression he called it cosmic depression
4492089 our cosmology from science our understanding of ourselves who we are and how did we get here is incomplete and possibly flawed and that our cultural expression maybe religion our cultural cosmology is archaic and certainly flawed
4492090 originally the album was going to be called the ed mitchell clinic for cosmic depression
4492091 a lot of the songs have more to do with cosmic realities and universal dilemmas that everyone can relate to
4492092 being able to take a few steps back and look at the big picture helps the listener interpret the songs for his or herself
4492093 were not exactly telling them what the songs are about we dont write topical songs its open for interpretation and i think thats part of the cosmic appeal
4492094 its not like we play theremins or make space noises but i feel like its a little more psychedelic or i guess you could call it spacey
4492095 we have a lot of spaced out rhythms we dont record to a click track we did that on purpose so that things seem a little more chaotic so you get more of a cosmic feel
4492096 the ep was recorded just in bedrooms and random places
4492097 it was more of a mish mash you know stuff so we could throw up some songs on the myspace or whatever we never really sat down and mapped it out like this new album this new one had a lot more construction
4492098 weve been having van problems and sleeping in lobbies for like three days and were still having a really great time

4492254 parasites transmitted by sand flies to mice lacking neutrophils have more difficulty establishing an infection and surviving this demonstrates the importance of neutrophils at the site of an infected sand fly bite and suggests the unexpected path taken by the parasite from sand fly to neutrophil to macrophage is a critical component of this disease

4492301 theres a fair amount of risk and harm that results from testing mistakes and slips

4492308 people inherit angelman syndrome as a mutant ube3a gene that does not make ube3a protein

4492357 the first flight was a success and made the first in situ measurements of gases in a volcanic plume using meteorological balloons
4492358 with flight visualization using google earth we were looking at tropospheric volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and water which can be hazardous to human and animal health and degrade ecosystems
4492359 we are fairly confident of three findings first this work is feasible for measuring sulfur dioxide so2 and carbon dioxide co2 in volcanic emissions for several hours after eruptions second there is a loss of so2 after one hour of flight away from the source which could reflect conversion to sulfate aerosol which may lower the earths temperature by reflecting away solar radiation and third there is a clear stratification of so2 above co2 within the plumes
4492360 one of the largest subdivisions in america is ocean view and it is downwind from the volcano on the west side of the island durant noted we detected sulfur dioxide over the development several hours after it was erupted into the atmosphere
4492361 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
4492362 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
4492363 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
4492364 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
4492365 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
4492366 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere

4492404 as you are likely aware our shared push for impeachment hearings and genuine accountability has had mixed success while we have not yet secured hearings the house of representatives approved a contempt citation against harriet miers and josh bolten and the judiciary committee has formally recommended the same for karl rove
4492405 last month a federal judge ruled against miers and bolten ordering them to comply with the congressional subpoenas while the administration will no doubt appeal we have won a major legal battle that exposes the flimsy case president bush has put forward
4492406 the often slow pace of this process is both frustrating and in my view dangerous to our country
4492407 the idea that the president and vice president might finish out their terms without being forced to answer for the illegal use of torture illegal politicization of the justice department conspiracy to obstruct justice by ignoring congressional subpoenas and other charges including the lies that led to the war in iraq is one i will not even grudgingly accept
4492408 impeachment hearings can provide the opportunity to cut through the executive privilege defenses and force this administration to answer a congress it has clearly chosen to ignore
4492409 we know you would agree that as members of congress we can not allow legitimate oversight to be thwarted or such a dangerous precedent to stand
4492410 there is no question that over the next three months there will be great pressure to focus solely on the presidential election i myself am facing two self funded opponents one of whom has vowed to spend a million dollars to defeat me

4492477 though mortgage mail volume remains far lower than a year ago this is the first uptick weve seen in two years

4492509 oh i saw rowan atkinson coming out of the toilets
4492510 my experience coming to transform from beginning to end has been fantastic
4492511 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behavior it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them
4492512 mak ing such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
4492513 revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are
4492514 both camps point fingers at each other as a way to cement their own reason for existence
4492515 you need to fix things early and that requires a certain level of disclosure for the developers
4492516 you also dont need to make a big production out of it
4492517 what does the whole security labeling give you except for more fodder for either of the pr camps that i obviously think are both idiots pushing for their own agenda
4492518 any situation that allows the vendor to sit on the bug for weeks or months is unacceptable as is any situation that makes it harder for people who find problems to talk to technical people
4492519 so the whole embargoes are good mentality is just corruption from the vendors
4492520 but on the other hand disclosure should not be the goal
4492521 have a model where security is easier to do in the first place that is the unix model but make it easy for people to report bugs with no embargo but privately
4492522 even then i will forward it to technical people on an as needed basis because even that embargo secrecy is not some insane absolute thing

4492554 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4492558 to further accelerate the adoption of the lwuit framework it is important to provide access to the source code under a liberal and well known open source license
4492559 this license choice provides the benefits of open source innovation and collaborative development while offering a risk free path to adoption by commercial products a model everybody should feel very comfortable with

4492583 when josh smith signed that contract with memphis it prohibited any sign and trade for smith either by memphis or atlanta when atlanta matched the offer that made smith ineligible to be traded for 90 days from the day he signed the contract and also gave him one year of veto power on any trade meaning that smith has to consent to any trade the hawks could work out after the 90 days have passed the rule is 90 days or december 15th whichever is later also smith automatically became a byc player when he signed that contract which means that since the contract was reported as a 5 year 58 million dollar contract smiths first year salary is 10 million dollars so his byc value 50 of the first years salary is 5 million to the hawks but 10 million to any team he is traded to with the rules regarding trades in the nba the receiving team would have to send out at least 7 4 million dollars in contracts 25 100k of 10 million while the hawks could only take back 6 35 million 25 100k of 5 million so there would have to be a third team or extra players involved when the nba raised the trade rules from 20 100k to 25 100k it did make trades involving byc players easier but still difficult atlanta could add players to increase their outgoing total but that total would also increase the other teams value meaning they would have to send out more contracts too but a trade going something like this could be worked out detroit sends tayshaun prince 9 5 million and amir johnson 3 66 million to atlanta for josh smith 10 million 5 million byc and speedy claxton 5 7 million that trade would work under the cba rules basicaly any sign and trade cant happen but if the hawks and josh smith want to trade with detroit it would have to be after december 15th and would require a trade somewhat like the scenario i gave above

4492697 outside the so called big four manchester united chelsea liverpool and arsenal there are some difficulties facing the clubs financially
4492698 given the present economic climate it is understandable that banks are more reluctant to lend but this may also reflect a deep seated unease about the financial viability of some premiership clubs
4492699 we have so far only seen the beginnings of the credit crunch ripple effect
4492700 it is proving to be a reality check for the big teams who are having to look at ways of tightening their belts which should ensure the long term future of the game
4492701 this will almost certainly help clubs gain control over their finances and focus resources on their best players
4492702 people have to be realistic a few more players might arrive but not for big money
4492703 the credit crunch is there and everybody has been affected by it we dont get away just because we are a football club
4492704 the banks are now tighter and not prepared to put debt on you just cannot continue to increase debts
4492705 they dont want to attach themselves to a club which with great respect to west brom may not be in the premier league within 12 months time
4492706 theres not a good track record of clubs going up and staying up and sponsors are looking for a long term deal so this may be where it got a bit tricky for them

4492734 the beijing olympics organizing committee spent several years to gather candidate songs we collected thousands of songs i felt that many songs seemed to used hand in hand the theme song of seoul olympics as a model many people including media thought that the theme song of beijing olympics should be similar to that kind of song hand in hand and many lyricists and composers followed that style finally the same was i
4492735 one day i happened to hear you and i i felt that the song was beautiful at that time the lyrics and music are simple the major purpose of our creative work was to complete an artwork on site we wanted to create a unique original unmatched and the greatest behavioral artwork in the world and we wanted to express our best wishes the lyrics of this song like you and me from one world we are one family are touching and easy to learn so other directors immediately loved this song and we felt that it fit the theme of 2008 beijing olympics harmony we recommended this song to musical professionals they all liked it
4492736 the message of this song is pure and simple when i firstly heard this song i could not believe that it was the theme song later i felt that its purity and simplicity was a good idea it is different from the grand style that we might expect but it was creative to choose this song especially when this song was performed on olympics opening ceremony the artistic conception developed from this song was very beautiful
4492737 former olympics theme songs were full of joys and passion this time we took a new way which led to harmony and humanity

4492809 how do you respond to the occasional rumor that youre a lesbian

4492823 as ive said before if george bush wont bring the troops home now when im president i will of course by then now will have passed and what now will mean then is hard to tell now it depends on what the meaning of now is
4492824 this war never should have started thats why i voted against it in the first place now that its under way i have called for the president to bring the troops home however it would be irresponsible of me to say whether as president i would bring the troops home before 2012 because things look different when one is commander in chief at this time as a senator running for president i think its irresponsible for bush to leave the troops in iraq but that could change the day i take office by virtue of the office i take and through no fault of my own
4492825 what seems like the right thing to do now is the right the thing to do
4492826 i know that im not wrong about this like i was wrong about voting for the war so im confident that this president should bring our troops home now however i cannot make commitments on behalf of a future commander in chief who might turn out to be me
4492827 we know the troops cant come home now or anytime in the near future but that doesnt mean we should stop calling on the president to do that which none of us would do if we were sitting in his chair right now
4492828 i like de idee of giving every baby who manages to survive roe v wade and be borned in america a 5 000 account dat will grow over time so dat when dat young chil turns 18 if day have finished high school day will be able to access it to go to college or maybe day will be able to make dat down payment on day first home or maybe use it make some good connections down n columbia or venezuela

4492940 bahwa boleh menghujat dan menyebutkan keburukan ahli bidah dengan tujuan untuk menasihati umat agar mereka tidak terpengaruhi mereka
4492941 allah taala menghendaki agar dari segolongan umat ada yang peduli masalah amar maruf dan nahi mungkar
4492942 barangsiapa yang melihat kemungkaran hendaklah mengubah dengan tangannya tafsir ibnu katsir 1 290
4492943 umat islam akan tetap bisa menyabet predikat umat terbaik asal memenuhi syarat di atas
4492944 ayat di atas berstatus hal yang berarti predikat umat terbaik sangat terkait dengan kemauan dalam beramar maruf dan nahi mungkar

4492948 orang yang mengajak kepada bidah berhak mendapat sanksi berdasarkan kesepakatan kaum muslimin
4492949 allah tidak menyukai ucapan buruk yang diucapkan dengan terus terang kecuali oleh orang yang dianiaya allah adalah maha mendengar lagi maha mengetahui
4492950 ada salah seseorang bertamu lalu tidak mendapat hak tamu secara layak

4492960 aku akan potong potong kehormatan kalian selagi nyawaku masih di kandung badan
4492961 aib ahli bidah dan kesesatan buku buku mereka harus dijelaskan kepada semua orang agar orang orang yang lemah iman dan ilmu tidak terjerat oleh kesesatan mereka
4492962 seperti tokoh tokoh ahli bidah yang mempunyai pemikiran yang bertentangan dengan al quran dan as sunnah atau ibadah yang bertentangan dengan al quran dan as sunnah memperingatkan umat dari bahaya mereka berhukum wajib menurut kesepakatan kaum muslimin hingga pernah imam ahmad ditanya
4492963 jika seorang sholat dan itikaf hanya untuk dirinya sendiri tetapi orang yang berbicara keburukan ahli bidah
4492964 jika seorang sholat dan itikaf hanya untuk dirinya sendiri tetapi orang yang berbicara keburukan ahli bidah untuk seluruh kaum muslimin dan ini yang lebih utama
4492965 bila ahli bidah memiliki keyakinan atau cara ibadah yang bertentangan dengan al quran dan as sunnah serta dikhawatirkan mereka menyesatkan orang
4492966 tidak boleh membicarakan ahli bidah secara khusus kecuali dalam dua keadaan dan saya cukup menyebutkan kedua saja yaitu jika firqah tersebut mengajak kepada kesesatan dan membuat orang awam dan orang yang tidak berilmu menjadi tergiur dan terpedaya dengan kebidahan mereka
4492967 kalian ingin aku meraih kedudukan para nabi itu tidak saya miliki semoga allah taala menjaga ahmad bin hambal dari arah depan dan belakangnya
4492968 manusia menginginkan aku seperti imam ahmad demi allah taala aku tidak bisa seperti imam ahmad dan tidak bisa menempuh jalan ahmad
4492969 this year has not been normal because of the internally displaced persons who took refuge in the province and also due to unfavourable climatic conditions that adversely affected our food crops
4492970 our projection for this year is that we are likely to require nearly double the relief food rations 150 000 bags of maize and 60 000 bags of beans to see us through
4492971 some of these areas have to make do with relief food until the next crop
4492972 indeed there is need for an emop emergency operation assessment to help identify the actual needs on the ground
4492973 the short rains maize crop has been harvested yields were low and expected to drop by 75 per cent bean yields are very low and are expected to drop by over 90 per cent
4492974 currently 60 percent of the farming households are depending on the markets for their food items
4492975 farm input prices especially fertilisers have also risen dramatically in price and with the long rains planting season being over many farmers reduced on the rates or completely avoided their usage and this will greatly hamper food security this year

4493154 the global economy which had long remained resilient despite u s weakness is now slowing significantly
4493155 on what issues do you seek scientific and technical advice where do you seek and obtain that advice
4493156 its thirty four years later and we are still in a state of war
4493157 you know what gets me always is were always asked about the question of violence and you know henry kissinger and others go through life and thats never the first question they are asked i mean what who ever asks kissinger when did you decide turn to violence to dominate vietnam no one ever asks it that way its outrageous
4493158 willing to act even when you know youre knowledge is incomplete
4493159 if there were any justice david would be on the street today
4493160 his humanity just comes through in these interviews hes a descent wonderful and loving guy
4493161 the myth making about the 1960s makes it seem terribly disempowering to militants and activists today because the lie is that it was all easy
4493162 we had to do whatever we had to do in order to stop the war
4493163 in our minds the world is heading straight to the precipice and if we a group of twenty year olds dont stop it then the planet will be dead
4493164 didnt know bill siegel or sam green but i just tend to anyone who asks me to talk about it i talk about it
4493165 beginnings of the gay and lesbian movement and of really rethinking the heirarchys of family
4493166 the look you give when the fbi when theyre taking your picture
4493167 whats the jobs of white people when this is happening to black leaders malcolm king fred what do we do
4493168 we all know were being lied to by our government and we know that there is a state of permanent war going on all over the world and most of us know its wrong and it doesnt make us safer and its really plundering the world for the profits of a few so what are we doing
4493169 clearly part of the point of those in power is to say youre not effecting us were not listening and to make people feel alienated disenfranchised uhm cynical passive pacified but what advice do you give young people what do you say today
4493170 that was the most disparing i ever felt in my life
4493171 the united states anti war movement in the face of this kind of violence really was restrained mainly nobody was killed one person in madison mainly nobody was injured
4493172 a van loaded with six barrels of explosives blew up just outside the east wing of sterling hall at the university of wisconsin campus in madison
4493173 look at this criminal act they conflated these hideous act of mansons with the movement
4493174 its emblematic of what the us was doing in vietnam this is the us in vietnam
4493175 some people felt literally that the bigger mess we could make the better that is that whatever it cost whatever you know destructive uhm kinds of activity we could do against the us government the better
4493176 we tried to bring the reality of war and empire home
4493177 anyone who thinks vietnam wasnt official state terrorism is missing the very essence of what was going on
4493178 what we wanted to do was deliver the most horrific hit that the united states government had ever suffered on its territory we wanted to light it up our slogan was bring the war home and we really wanted to give the united states and the rest of the world a sense that this country was going to be completely unlivable if the united states continued in vietnam and that was the goal of this group
4493179 were willing to be mass murderers this is mass murder were talking
4493180 you know we all exaggerated but uh laughs we were not mass murderers we didnt murder anybody you know the difference between stalin and hitler and uh people who didnt murder anybody didnt kill anybody through the most extraordinary decade of provocation is a choice we chose not to be terrorists we chose not to hurt anybody
4493181 we did not want to participate in terrorism in any form
4493182 symbolic and very particular all of weather undergrounds actions were understood by everybody without the communique really they spoke for themselves cause they were so focused there was nothing random and no civilian targets no human targets property damage thats why todds comments is so preposterous really the idea that were mass murders when it was property damage at the end of the day
4493183 the beginning of a lot of new movements gay and lesbian environmental disabled
4493184 i think we can now look back and say the whole movement not the weather underground or the black panther party but the whole movement the organizing the draft resistance the womens movement and so on all uhm sustained this aroused opposition for ten years to the war and even though we were unable to unable to stop the war and even for all the limitations and mistakes you could say that we sustained a popular resistance we toppled two presidents that we left behind we in the big sense now in the movement left a legacy that uhm accomplished some real things we i think created a cradle for new movements that went through the 80s and 90s i think the war powers act limited the americans ability to plunder the rest of the world i think the draft was abolished the fbi and cia restraints were put on the movement wasnt criminalized people like stu and judy here and millions of people in the mass movement continue to mobilize and organize so there was a legacy that changed the course of american history even though we didnt make a revolution we didnt start the war but you couldnt know that when youre acting in the history
4493185 the notion of being illegal i mean to be declared illegal and fighting against this system is very deep in the american tradition underground railroad john brown the uh boston tea party it goes way back
4493186 you know heres a group of demonstrators who say you mean were supposed to allow this guy to come in and just take this guy off maybe we should not let him and deciding that it happens i mean its a wonderful wonderful piece of film
4493187 there are so many people in prison today who in a just world would be free
4493188 the great thing about the hippie culture was it rejected the three pillars of kind of empire rejected militarism rejected materialism and rejected racism
4493189 there is no shame they can triumphantly talk about empire and triumphantly talk about repression its a terrible terrible time
4493190 an opportunity to uh convince to seize power again basically to seize power to seize the civil rights civil liberties freedoms that democracy promises us and say for our safety for our order for law and order you need to give up your rights again well take care of you we know how to make you safe nothing could be more foolish everybody knows that uh ultimately were not safe until everybody in the world is safe
4493191 i think that the end of the war did pretty much was the final coda to a lot of anti war organizations a lot of political organizations at the same time a lot of everything we fought for was absorbed into the institutions thats what reform movements are all about as opposed to revolutionary movements a lot of the things we agitated about were legislated and got investigated by the instead of us
4493192 we felt that more and more people would be attracted to the revolutionary violence of the weather underground and of the other groups what i began to discover was that americans are taught again and again from a very early age that the only violence that all violence which is not uhm sanctioned by the government is either criminal or mentally ill so our violence was categorized as that criminal and mentally ill
4493193 its true but you know its important to remember when you use that word our violence we destroyed property and i dont see how you can even use the same language to destroy to compare the murder of human beings with you know uh and office building or a nuclear silo or a b 52 theres just to comparison its true what we did was illegal its also true that it was destructive and cost someone some money but it didnt rise to the level of what was going on everyday in the normal workings of the us abroad and still
4493194 imperial project its always the same not only will they use people and throw them away but they will murder indiscriminately theyll do what they feel they have to do and there will be resistance what we have to do is make ourselves the resistance to that war and we have to wake up internationally get the us out
4493195 the us government pay reparations for the damage theyve done is essential
4493196 i wish i could bend bars i wish we could get i mean lets open up the prisons lets just start there
4493197 its interesting at how much the prison movement of thirty five years ago was just prelude for whats coming because two million people behind bars
4493198 i think the united states was on a wrong track and declining and i think it still is very much on the wrong track and still in spite of all the illusion on decline
4493199 if youre gonna occupy iraq youre gonna break down doors youre gonna terrorize the civilian populations youre gonna be bombing from the air
4493200 they are already torturing people incarcerating people without any due process its all happening and thats what colonialism looks like
4493201 det r klart att man hoppar till lite det r r sig om uppseendev ckande vapentyper som pansarskott och spr ng mnen
4493202 i see jimmy in training every day and i see him working very hard at his game i see him very focused and committed to the team so these things dont really tie up
4493203 i havent had any conversations with him since alistair macintosh made it clear that we dont want to be discussing at the moment new contracts for players who have at least two years left on their current ones
4493204 we would rather concentrate on improving our squad and seeing how that improvement pans out then maybe as the contracts go further into their term there will be time for readjustment
4493205 i dont really understand the arguments because if people are trying to suggest jimmy bullard is unhappy then that is not the case
4493206 he is getting on with his work professionally he perhaps didnt get what he wanted to make him the happiest person but im sure he fully understands the situation
4493207 is as good at this stage as any kid who has come through the program
4493208 hes a fantastic kid very intelligent with a great attitude and he wins his own football
4493209 i dont know if im the right person to talk to
4493210 hes played a lot of live football im looking past practice and looking at when he was called during pregame against miami a rival and hes the big east player of the week i know what he can do in a game like situation
4493211 obviously ben made great plays on the perimeter he was not the consummate pocket passer but he was really savvy in terms of protecting himself he had a lot of leadership qualities that dustin can bring to the table now its dustins turn to go have the year that ben mauk had
4493212 college football is high level and you have to keep competition and keep people pushing themselves at all times having more guys here is competition and it pushes us to a higher level than we even thought i had that before when they brought in nick davila youre going to have competition there thats part of what makes teams better
4493213 when youre the no 1 its implicit that youd better go out and get the job done or youre not going to be the no 1
4493214 i dont think he could have held onto the position unless he had a level of confidence in his ability to get the job done im not going to put a guy out there who doesnt believe he can get the job done
4493215 the teva mountain games continues to provide an authentic platform for both amateur and professional athletes to compete alongside each other
4493216 this long term alliance with rossignol adds a key core mountain brand to the teva mountain games that ensures the success of this iconic adventure event for years to come i look forward to what rossignol teva and mountain games will do together

4493240 a still better way to improve convention coverage would be to withdraw all reporters and force the curious to rely on a c span feed unless a brokered convention threatens to break out these political gatherings tend to produce very little real news yet the networks the newspapers the magazines and the web sites continue to insist on sending battalions of reporters to sift for itsy specks of information according to forbes 15 000 pressies are expected to attend each of the conventions slate im embarrassed to admit is sending a team of eight to denver and six to st paul attention don graham were spending your cash like its zimbabwean bank notes
4493241 if you think its hard to eat that much just imagine how hard it is to poop that much nobody thinks about that
4493242 well when i was younger i wasnt packing in twelve thousand calories a day but i was putting down at least half that much pop tarts fruity pebbles eggos apple jacks pillsbury cinnamon rolls cinnamon toast crunch nintendo power cereal when i competed in my first swim meet at age five i was halfway through the one hundred butterfly when an uncontainably strong urge to poop swept over me instead of flip turning at the wall i jumped out ran to the bathroom and pooped like i had never pooped before were talking five or six flushes here then i noticed somebody had clogged the toilet next to me so i plunged that while i was there then i raced back toward the pool but first i saw a kitten in a tree and a little girl crying so i crawled up the tree and rescued it then some fighter jets flew overhead and i had to stop and salute them i was almost back in the pool when a woman passed out and needed cpr and since i had just learned it i was kind of excited to practice the mouth to mouth part was a little gross but hey somebody needed to save her life some bystanders wanted my autograph afterwards so i signed their programs and various body parts the local paper had been alerted about the kitten rescue but when they got to the pool they also found out about me saving the womans life so there were a few photo ops the light wasnt quite right at first so we waited maybe half an hour for the sun to be in the right place and then i jumped back in the pool and finished a half second ahead of the world record for my age group
4493243 i reread infinite jest yesterday in july i polished off all of shakespeare ive always wanted to read the complete oxford english dictionary so i might tackle that next
4493244 when we come and hit the ball were a tough team to beat
4493245 they are three quality starters and theyre pitching really well
4493246 our pitching is as good as anybody here if not the best so if we score them some runs theyre not going to give up a lot
4493247 theres still a lot of ball to be played but the girls are up for it
4493248 they are playing well and really coming together as a team
4493249 prove how fair he was by treating me incredibly unfairly
4493250 were always looking for someone to blame for the way weve turned out
4493251 it was a good experience and to win at such a young age it was just awesome
4493252 were at home and maybe theres a little more pressure because everybodys watching us but we really want to win
4493253 but once you start playing its like any other game you just want to win
4493254 i was a lot more nervous in bowling the pressure is all on you whereas in ball if you make an error someones there to help you out

4493258 we are the first city in the commonwealth of pennsylvania to ever have a full time bicycle pedestrian coordinator
4493259 i suppose that as a result of us working so closely together we became very similar in terms of our work style and humour so towards the end of his life i must have seemed to him the obvious choice to take over the ginger meggs legacy
4493260 the faith kems showed in asking me to do it meant more to me than anything else and the fact that he asked me meant that he knew he was dying which to me was devastating
4493261 he could no longer talk but his wife helen put the phone up to his ear and i said you dont have to worry mate meggs is in safe hands hes going to go well beyond his 100th year
4493262 whitton and dyer say they found the seven foot seven 550 pound corpse in north georgia
4493263 i think its in violation of ethical rules which talk about a lawyer not releasing evidence that is likely to prejudice a proceeding
4493264 i think its contemptuous of this proceeding on the part of the defense
4493265 today paraguay breaks with its reputation for corruption breaks with the few feudal lords of the past
4493266 there are backward looking factions within this party who aspire to come back to power early and not democratically
4493267 will not sabotage fernando lugo nor create a climate of hostility during his term
4493268 the feed in tariff will provide the opportunity for owners to install solar pv and generate clean electricity and the home and building owners can then sell the excess solar electricity to the power utility at a much higher price than the retail tariff rate
4493269 the government indeed is committed to maintaining economic stability by controlling the prices of fuel oil and the basic electricity tariff
4493270 although we have also been affected by the global economy we are optimistic because our economy is still growing over 6 percent per year for the last eight quarters and the first quarter of this year we still grow at 6 4 percent and so we are cautious but we are optimistic about the situation
4493271 we are upbeat that our records show that we have been able to go after the terrorist activities terrorist cells and etcetera
4493272 the president also warns that there is always a possibility of attack from terrorist but we are determined to make sure that any terrorism based on whatever reason they may be we will go after them we will destroy them
4493273 i liked his pitch so much i invested 600 000 in the company
4493274 the perfect elevator pitch is the one where the potential investor holds the elevator door open before getting off and says give me a business card
4493275 a distillation of an entrepreneurs business plan and business model
4493276 its easy to be longwinded and boring its extremely hard to be short and intriguing
4493277 it should sound like youre talking about your firstborn child
4493278 the better your business plan is the easier it is to put your elevator pitch together
4493279 if youre having trouble putting an elevator pitch together you probably dont know your business well enough
4493280 you need to get them interested show them youre credible and that your story has legs thats the foundation
4493281 the court considers that the defendants are still in the courts jurisdiction because the defendants had surrendered to authorities and the court had granted them bail
4493282 the court still has jurisdiction to proceed with the case and there is no reason to dismiss the case
4493283 the last thing that you wanted was for any harm to come to abbie and i accept that and i accept your remorse
4493284 but as i have said you should not have been on that motorcycle or on the pavement
4493285 and you should not have had a three year old girl sitting on the petrol tank with nowhere to put her feet and she had to hold on to your arms
4493286 this sentence is in no way meant to be a measure of the value of abbies life no one can put a value on abbies life like any life it is priceless
4493287 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere
4493288 it is my conviction that all issues can be resolved only through dialogue and peaceful means
4493289 i make a sincere appeal to the people of the state to maintain peace and calm in this difficult hour
4493290 we have reached important agreements on natural gas and electricity god willing we will complete them as soon as possible
4493291 officials are still conducting talks on this issue as you know projects of this kind take time as they depend on investment
4493292 every day in my life since has been the 15th of august 1998 because theres not a day you get out of bed or turn a corner that its not in your head its there in front of you
4493293 i still see myself going through that door and seeing lorraine her clothes soaking wet because the water mains had burst in the explosion
4493294 its not easy to bring that up but i still see that picture on a regular basis and it hurts
4493295 i see many of his friends about the town and theyre married some of them have children and i do believe probably aiden would have married and had children we have been denied all of that
4493296 my way of dealing with omagh was to embrace omagh
4493297 the incident highlights the dangerous and unpredictable nature of the work officers do everyday
4493298 thankfully the officers involved were not injured and after being shot at they have shown great bravery and dedication to continue to not only chase the suspect but also arrest him
4493299 although we would rather it did not happen in these circumstances we have also of course managed to take another gun off the streets of london
4493300 maybe more lawyers will be encouraged to take on these difficult cases as more courts assess fees for the false prosecution of these sham cases
4493301 commodities continue to fall off a cliff and the market likes it
4493302 rational optimism leads to stagnation it is irrational optimism that leads to reform
4493303 if this really happens in the real world women on the pill would end up choosing a more genetically similar mate than she would otherwise choose and the implications go on from there
4493304 my priority is supporting our men and women in uniform and ensuring their safety
4493305 i believe every service member and their families must be served by their country with the same dedication and honor with which they have served our nation
4493306 the problem with this old system is that we do not normally go back to the national assembly and account for the remaining benchmark
4493307 there has to be an account for the difference between 15 3 billion and the amount of the sale of the barrels for june
4493308 in recent years the creation of the excess revenue account as one of the nations fiscal policy instrument of managing revenue inflow into the federation account has been seen at the commission as well as many others as an aberration of the constitution particularly section 162 of the 1999 constitution all these excesses are not known to the law
4493309 how can they say that despite the infrastructural and developmental decay nigeria is experiencing the economic policymakers do not seem to tackle the major issues in nigeria
4493310 we wish to state that there is no financial involvement of the commission in the matter and we wish to reassure our stakeholders as well as the public that the accounts and operations of the commission have passed all checks and balances and have been found to be in order
4493311 indeed we hereby restate that we will continue to conduct the affairs of the commission with utmost decency probity and transparency and respect to due process and the rule of law
4493312 he tendered fake and doctored vouchers purported to have been used in the payment of the corps members in january
4493313 during investigation it was also discovered that the suspect underpaid members of the corps
4493314 he surcharged them monthly to cover what he termed administrative charges while the amount paid was never accounted for
4493315 i am glad to be back at thisday it is a huge brand to which i am happy to have contributed the paper is now one you cant ignore it is also a vast platform for national development and growth of my writing career i feel good to be back on track to my destiny
4493316 high global oil prices strong macro economic growth and increased involvement by international investors in the countrys maturing financial markets have created a boom period for nigeria already firmly established as the financial hub of west africa
4493317 although the nigerian domestic debt market is still relatively small by international standards private sector interest in naira denominated assets is rising standard amp poors believes the market will grow rapidly in the coming years as local and the federal governments banks and infrastructure projects seek to fund long term projects
4493318 we are here as part of our own efforts of trying to engage the media in what the nfvcb has been doing in the last couple of years
4493319 we have achieved success so far and we have also carried everyone who wished to be carried along
4493320 there is need for collaboration from everyone stakeholders producers government and the media to sensitise people on what is going on about regulation

4493328 the leadership of the u s which gives orders to georgian authorities is to blame for the caucasus burning
4493329 the president of the u s the imperialist george bush i am absolutely certain was the one who gave the order to georgian forces to burn towns and villages and to kill innocent people

4493332 we will continue working on this issue we are ready to continue discussing these issues with all the parties
4493333 the poles should be thanked for helping reveal the strategic goal of the u s missile defense plan
4493334 regrettably in the extremely difficult situation that has evolved today the american side is aggravating the relationship between the u s and russia
4493335 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable

4493344 dat kan makkelijk er is geen man overboord vorig jaar in osaka was ik meer teleurgesteld met de vierde plaats dan met mijn negende nu

4493347 if one can be good why should he be bad
4493348 accounts from a handful of well respected scientists suggest that since the mid 1990s wireless companies have been doing their best to bury worrying findings discredit researchers who publish them and design experiments that virtually guarantee the desired results biological effects are undoubtedly there no question and it s a canard to suggest that they re not says abe liboff a research professor at florida atlantic university and co editor of the journal electromagnetic biology and medicine the cellphone industry he insists will use any excuse to avoid the truth in the 90s did its best to bury the research of henry lai and n p singh which showed that radio frequency fields similar to those emitted by cellphones damaged rats brain cells and even sent out a congratulatory memo saying i think that we have sufficiently war gamed the lai singh issue
4493349 the entire mountaineer nation is thrilled with the great news that we received from the ncaa today

4493354 christianity is a hoodwink a farce believed by the unintellectual the gospels were just mythical stories dreamed up by writers far after the death of jesus christ at long length he decides to abandon any earlier beliefs and simply read about the man jesus christ
4493355 justus an incredible mind a beautiful spirit but alas a lifeless soul
4493356 how dare that son of a bitch speak to me like that

4493363 this is just something we can do to make their first experience here a little better
4493364 the looks on their faces when they realize we can do in one trip what it would take them to do in 15 is great
4493365 we do not learn from experience we learn from the reflection of experience
4493366 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4493367 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4493368 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4493369 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4493370 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4493371 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4493372 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4493378 the beijing olympics organizing committee spent several years to gather candidate songs we collected thousands of songs i felt that many songs seemed to used hand in hand the theme song of seoul olympics as a model many people including media thought that the theme song of beijing olympics should be similar to that kind of song hand in hand and many lyricists and composers followed that style finally the same was i
4493379 one day i happened to hear you and i i felt that the song was beautiful at that time the lyrics and music are simple the major purpose of our creative work was to complete an artwork on site we wanted to create a unique original unmatched and the greatest behavioral artwork in the world and we wanted to express our best wishes the lyrics of this song like you and me from one world we are one family are touching and easy to learn so other directors immediately loved this song and we felt that it fit the theme of 2008 beijing olympics harmony we recommended this song to musical professionals they all liked it
4493380 the message of this song is pure and simple when i firstly heard this song i could not believe that it was the theme song later i felt that its purity and simplicity was a good idea it is different from the grand style that we might expect but it was creative to choose this song especially when this song was performed on olympics opening ceremony the artistic conception developed from this song was very beautiful
4493381 we have definitely been seeing and hearing from our members about the issues of safety and soundness
4493382 as people saw some of the reports on the news about the indymac failure that did raise concern with some clients who have larger balances

4493385 i dont know that well be running newspaper ads necessarily but well be contacting all our cd customers and letting them know about the products especially the ones with higher balances that might be doing this already on their own
4493386 its an opportunity to sit down and talk with the customer rather than just handing them a brochure
4493387 theres no politics in the vfw or the american legion thats why were doing this
4493388 i see it growing throughout illinois and maybe through the united states

4493400 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
4493401 the biggest mystery is how they seemed to have done this without disturbing a single grave
4493402 what is so amazing is that the people who made these two types of pots lived in the same place more than a thousand years apart
4493403 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition

4493423 a ning n partido nacionalista o no se le puede reducir su presencia por la v a de modificar las leyes
4493424 mi criterio es que sin nimo de revancha se averiguara la verdad por completo para honrar a los muertos y para que nunca m s pueda repetirse un accidente de esa naturaleza por las mismas causas que aquel se ocasion
4493425 ahora se sabe mucho m s de lo que se sab a
4493426 lo que hice fue averiguar una verdad que cuando llegu al ministerio hab a sido ocultada y lo hice porque me lo pidieron las familias de los que hab an muerto cuyos cad veres les hab an sido entregados con falsedad y hasta hubo que desenterrarlos proclam lo que he hecho y volver a a hacer es ayudar a los familiares a conocer la verdad

4493438 after what has happened ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians
4493439 to say that i found some of russias actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia
4493440 the basic point for a political solution must be georgias territorial integrity
4493441 we agreed with french president sarkozys main principles for resolving the conflict these principles must be accepted by the georgian side
4493442 georgia and ukraine could be members of nato we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains
4493443 restore peace and to ensure that nobody again has such idiotic ideas
4493444 we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years
4493445 we dont want a long or short term warming of relations with the european union with the united states or with other countries
4493446 we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties
4493447 we are of course not against international peacekeepers but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers
4493448 women and children were murdered churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed
4493449 on thursday there were 120 journalists foreign diplomats and members of the orthodox clergy in the town none of them saw the alleged destruction that the georgians have so colorfully described

4493479 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100
4493480 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but the strategic potential of russia
4493481 never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy but the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the publics sense of domestic well being the economic self denial that is defense spending and the human sacrifice casualties even among professional soldiers required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization

4493484 its in roushs back yard and fords back yard so another win there would be huge
4493485 i always say darlington is my favorite race track but michigan is becoming a close second
4493486 michigan has a lot of personal history for me and im always glad to go there its where i made my first cup start where i made my 100th start and where i broke a 52 race winless streak with a win in june of last year
4493487 its a great track with some really awesome racing you can pass and i think the fans always see a good show there
4493488 i lived in michigan for a couple of years when i first started racing the trucks for roush in 1998 and 1999
4493489 its always great to win in michigan because its kind of the home track for ford and roush industries
4493490 michigan has always been one of my favorite tracks on the circuit
4493491 its fast and it allows for a lot of passing because it is so wide we won back to back races there in 2004 and 2005 and i think that a win this weekend is a reasonable goal
4493492 michigan is a track that weve been pretty strong at in the past
4493493 michigan and the next several races are some of my favorites for sure michigan bristol fontana and richmond are some of my favorite tracks and i always look forward to this stretch of races
4493494 the community has really lost confidence in local government in ballarat due to the public displays of internal issues and bickering
4493495 i am humbled by the huge swell of support i am receiving from both the community and business sector encouraging me to stand
4493496 as a former mayor and with six years experience as a councillor my passion for local government has not waned
4493497 it is critical that both council and community pride is reinstated
4493498 last year we know the race itself brought in just under 900 000 to the economy ms chalkley said
4493499 for something that goes for a weekend thats a good result and thats really based on the number of riders and their support crews who come into town for this sort of thing
4493500 competitors and spectators shop and eat and when here also think when they are on holidays they might come back and visit with the family so it has long term and short term spin offs
4493501 the accommodation providers always welcome them because they often come in teams and they will fill accommodation places quite readily
4493502 but i know some of the traders in sturt st find it doesnt benefit them they lose the locals and gain the visitors and some of the others find it difficult because the locals might stay away and they might not get any visitors
4493503 there is a general feeling around from retailers that might be the case but from a tourism point of view it brings people to town at a traditionally quiet time of the year people still have to eat and thats a good thing at a very wintry time
4493504 if its a bad law in 2007 there is no good reason to keep it until 2010
4493505 labor was elected on a platform of your rights at work and on fairness in the workplace and if that means anything its that construction workers should be treated equally
4493506 this is a hangover from the howard era and what we need to see is labor do what it was elected to do and look after working people
4493507 we are saying that 2010 is not good enough for us and we dont want it replaced with a similar organisation
4493508 the reality is if we allow a set of circumstances where something like this can be introduced with unparalleled powers and finances it could happen again
4493509 to scare him to the point he doesnt come back
4493510 after a prolonged period of drinking you chose to take a knife and stab your partner while he was asleep defenceless and inflicted serious injuries upon him
4493511 its delivered to the workplace and employees within the workplace so we have delivered it to 60 people in ballarat and several hundred across australia
4493512 its adding value to the employer and is of benefit to the employees because they get a national qualification when they finish
4493513 a lot of people when they think about waste think about rejects and rubbish
4493514 but waste is also things like waiting people waiting machinery waiting producing stuff at the wrong time carrying excess stock
4493515 its got our workplace to be more organised which has led to productivity improvements it has led to health and safety improvements
4493516 theres more positions than there are paramedics and were in a fairly competitive market
4493517 weve got one of the positions filled first time round and were going to continue with that recruitment process
4493518 the government needs to urgently address the wages and conditions of paramedics in this state were falling behind the rest of the country and we need to address it
4493519 the grampians is in desperate need of these 11 positions being filled and theyre going to have to do something to address it and fill these positions
4493520 we are struggling to attract paramedics and the response that were getting from the government is a 25 per cent pay decrease
4493521 we should be increasing staff we should be putting in another mica mobile intensive care ambulance unit and the government should be increasing peoples pay so they want to come and work here
4493522 they expressly authorize the fbi to engage in intelligence collection inside the united states
4493523 there was clear eyed and bipartisan recognition after the attacks that we needed to be able and allowed to collect intelligence in the united states
4493524 under the new guidelines the investigative steps that the fbi may take in a particular investigation will not be driven by irrelevant factors such as the type of paperwork the agent uses to open the investigation
4493525 im concerned with the way the attorney general frames the problem
4493526 he talks about arbitrary or irrelevant differences between criminal and national security investigations but these were corrections originally designed to prevent the type of overreach the fbi engaged in for years
4493527 nobodys complaining about the fbi collecting domestic intelligence when its appropriate and authorized under the law
4493528 what the attorney general is doing is expanding the bureaus intelligence collection without addressing the mismanagement within the fbi if you have an agency collecting more with less oversight its only going to get worse

4493535 the embassy of georgia requested the call because of georgian concerns over recent russian actions dealing with south ossetia and abkhazia
4493536 scheunemann and others on the foreign policy staff are involved in call requests and statements on foreign policy issues
4493537 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
4493538 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
4493539 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions
4493540 its these sorts of appearances of a conflict of interest that are a natural consequence of having a campaign run by lobbyists staffed by lobbyists and being ensconced in a lobbyist culture for over a quarter of a century

4493547 the only time that we win is when we come together in 1960 john kennedy the late john kennedy beat richard nixon by only 112 000 votes less than one vote per precinct he won by the margin of our hope he brought us together he reached out
4493548 in 1964 lyndon johnson brought both wings together the thesis the antithesis and the creative synthesis and together we won in 1976 jimmy carter unified us again and we won when do we not come together we never win in 1968 the division and despair in july led to our defeat in november in 1980 rancor in the spring and the summer led to reagan in the fall when we divide we cannot win we must find common ground as the basis for survival and development and change and growth

4493602 aparentemente habr an recomprado deuda de aerol neas cuando estaba concursada con lo cual uno de los principales acreedores ser a la propia marsans
4493603 va a tener que darle una explicaci n a la sociedad qui nes son los que la regalaron obscenamente los que permitieron que la vaciaran y se inflara la deuda los que hace seis a os miran imp vidos como se sigue inflando o los que reestatizan ahora no hay ni media autocr tica
4493604 haber dispuesto que la detenci n de corres quien estuvo un a o y medio pr fugo se cumpliera en una delegaci n de la polic a federal mbito claramente inadecuado
4493605 haber permitido por acci n u omisi n condiciones privilegiadas de detenci n para corres las cuales adem s de constituir un privilegio inadmisible y una ofensa a las v ctimas visiblemente le facilitaban la fuga en cualquier momento
4493606 haberse anticipado a retomar sus funciones quince d as antes de la culminaci n de sus vacaciones con el confesado objetivo de asumir la investigaci n de la fuga y de las responsabilidades de los jefes de la delegaci n de la polic a federal con quienes ten a una relaci n de larga data al igual que con el pr fugo

4493611 yo tengo un compromiso nadie me trajo de los pelos hasta ac ni me oblig a nada creo que esta es una amenaza como tantas que se vienen sucediendo a lo largo y ancho del pa s desde que se iniciaron los juicios otra vez lo que hay que hacer es muy simple consolidarse fuertemente en un criterio de unidad respecto de estas cuestiones para que se hago justicia con los cr menes de la dictadura avanzar fuertemente sobre este tema y terminar con la impunidad y no ceder un pice en cualquier gesto que intenten estos tipos que son el apoyo log stico econ mico o como se los quiera llamar

4493613 se trata de secuestrar algo vinculado con la posible complicidad con la fuga de corres y para esto se hace un registro se buscan soportes inform ticos tel fonos celulares computadoras im genes de video alguna agenda o lo que hubiere para poder determinar algo se est evaluando esa informaci n
4493614 es uno de los factores fundamentales que se est implementando y ser a la primera aplicaci n que se hace de la nueva ley de recompensas
4493615 la orden est dada pero hay que graduarla en funci n de la efectividad que se pueda tener y las informaciones que se puedan recoger pero es toda tarea de investigaci n e inteligencia que se est realizando escuch la entrevista
4493616 una sorpresa total porque nunca imagin que se pod a fugar una persona siendo tan f cilmente reconocible y siendo que estaba con una prisi n preventiva ordenada por un juez de la naci n
4493617 esto no es una fuga simple porque nadie puede fugarse de la delegaci n de la polic a federal si no lo dejan salir o sin una ayudita de sus amigos
4493618 a l tendr an que preguntarle que fue lo que pas con este procesado
4493619 cuando m s se tiene que tener cuidado m xime cuando para que corres venga a declarar fue capturado por interpol porque ya estaba pr fugo es una persona pr fuga con antecedentes
4493620 no quedan dudas que la responsabilidad es de la polic a federal a partir incluso de los procedimientos que ha llevado adelante el fiscal en cuanto a allanamientos de domicilios de la polic a a la decisi n del gobierno nacional de poner en disponibilidad a todos los integrantes de la delegaci n local
4493621 no puede ser que este personaje de una etapa negra de la historia por corres tenga la posibilidad de estar en una comisar a cuando cumpli con todos los tr mites de la indagatoria en lugar de haber sido trasladado a la c rcel como cada uno de los genocidas que participaron en la dictadura ac en bah a blanca no s lo se facilita una situaci n de este tipo a partir de esta conducta sino de un juez que viene actuando en forma deficiente como m nimo
4493622 si esta es la perspectiva es decir que se mueran los que todav a no pueden llegar a juicio por una cuesti n de edad que algunos est n locos y no puedan ser indagados ni llevados a juicio y que encima se fugue por segunda vez un responsable como ste uno de los vivos y los m s j venes que han tenido participaci n directa en cada uno de los hechos de esta ciudad me parece que estamos en una situaci n mucho m s grave de la que hemos denunciado todo el tiempo
4493623 las c maras de seguridad de la dependencia no funcionaban desde hace a os
4493624 haber formado parte del plan criminal clandestino e ilegal implementado para secuestrar torturar asesinar y producir desaparici n forzada de personas utilizando la estructura org nica de las fuerzas armadas y las de seguridad a ellas subordinadas federales y provinciales
4493625 el pueblo no delibera ni gobierna sino a trav s de sus representantes

4493628 el hambre y la miseria en la que se encuentra la gente
4493629 el intendente de la quiaca no responde al alineamiento oficial y por eso le tendieron una cama para poder intervenir el municipio
4493630 no entiendo como los ricos pueden estar tirando leche y hacer lo que quieran y no les hacen nada
4493631 creo que la gente vive una vida mucho m s significativa que la que creemos desde nosotros pasa que de toda esa muchedumbre no hay registro porque al poder le importa solamente el poder el hecho de que registremos un crimen implica que para nosotros es connatural y queremos la paz registramos lo nico que nos contradice pero entre contradicci n y contradicci n hay un oc ano inmenso de gente que ha vivido una peque a vida pero con sentido pero eso no deja registro en la historia la historia de alguna forma es la historia de los cr menes es la historia del poder y el poder gana matando
4493632 un chico humilde m s fusilado por solo escuchar m sica con sus amigos
4493633 son los mismos responsables del asesinato del periodista grafico jose luis cabezas la masacre de ramayo la que planto pruebas falsas en la causa de la voladura de la amia la de los secuestros extorsivos los desarmaderos de autos el trafico de drogas la prostituci n y el juego clandestino
4493634 dos bandas que se unieron para agredir a los m viles policiales y a un colectivo de l nea que pasaba por el lugar
4493635 festejaban un cumplea os de 15 pero terminaron con las velitas en la comisar a
4493636 ni bien salieron del sal n un m vil policial de la comisar a tercera de ing white comenz a seguir al nutrido grupo mayoritariamente de adolescentes de ambos sexos entre 13 y 18 a os uno de los menores llevaba de regreso una damajuana para ser devuelta y sin mediar palabra un polic a baj del m vil rompi de un golpe dado con un arma larga la damajuana tom al menor y lo empuj violentamente sobre el capot de la camioneta al instante una de las madres que acompa aba al grupo le pide explicaci n de por qu lo detienen si el chico no estaban haciendo nada la polic a ignora la pregunta y contin a maltratando al joven
4493637 otro polic a comienza a disparar con arma larga balas de goma generando la huida de un grupo mientras que otros indignados por la agresi n policial comenzaron a apedrear a la polic a
4493638 cuatro menores y un mayor fueron detenidos y duramente golpeados en distintos puntos de villa delfina al menos 5 menores m s que lograron escapar a la cacer a humana desatada presentan heridas de bala de goma
4493639 este mismo polic a se hizo presente en la comisar a de ing white e intent agredir a los menores all detenidos en la agresi n a los menores alojados en ing white particip al menos una polic a
4493640 los j venes luego de ser golpeados fueron amenazados por el jefe del destacamento policial de villa rosas teniente 1 gonzalez quien les dijo si hablan de esto los encuentro en la calle
4493641 toda la sociedad debe cambiar la forma de pensar no solamente los que est n a cargo de instituciones dedicadas a los ni os y j venes
4493642 uno de los trabajadores habr a comunicado hace unos d as que en la m quina que finalmente fue la que provoc la descarga el ctrica se sent a una especie de cosquilleo y se sigui trabajando en las mismas condiciones
4493643 lo concreto es que una descarga el ctrica provoc la muerte de este trabajador que obviamente no es la primera y eso lo sabemos todos pero lamentablemente podemos asegurar que no ser la ltima
4493644 todo esto es como consecuencia de la precarizaci n laboral en este rubro como en tantos otros ya los empleados no tienen relaci n de dependencia sino que en su mayor a revistan en cooperativas

4493650 en ese momento la nueva provincia publicaba casi a diario testimonios de mi padre cuando este se encontraba desaparecido
4493651 dentro de la correspondencia habitual recibo una carta un poco extra a pero simplemente a mi nombre la abro y tenia una amenaza escrita a mano firmada por las tres
4493652 casi todos en ese momento se fueron de la ciudad yo me fui a buenos aires pero no pod a irme muy lejos porque en esos momentos naci mi segunda hija

4493655 el nombra para la universidad un equipo de 30 personas justific ndose en el hecho de que era un momento muy dif cil aunque en realidad era seguridad para el seguridad privada

4493701 he cares about how we do out there i know that when i go out there im as prepared as i can be and he is too that doesnt always translate to a good game but it gives you the best chance to win

4493707 i went from working out over 40 hours a week to nothing and kept eating the same amount of food
4493708 it took some time but i figured out an everything in moderation approach that works for me

4493715 every cable and satellite operator compresses network signals according to their bandwidth needs it can vary from market to market household to household
4493716 there are many variables that may affect a transmission signal the transmission to the satellites alone causes some distortion also viewers tv sets cable connections and locations vary widely
4493717 we are rolling out amc hd in some markets but it is not yet widely carried were hoping to expand carriage significantly throughout the year
4493718 the change could result in comic con an event thats rapidly expanded in recent years to include tv programming siphoning attention from the critics tour
4493719 every year san diego comic con ends with people griping that it has gotten to be too big and that something has to change but was this the year that lived up to the complaints
4493720 people always say that as if its a good thing
4493721 thats not to say were not getting phone calls from their agents saying theyre huge now and were respectful of that were not expecting anyone to do it because they owe us there are actors that have come to some prominence theyre helping us out because they want to do it
4493722 starting before the events of the miniseries our story focuses on familiar characters including cylon number one known as cavil stockwell resistance leader sam t anders trucco and chief galen tyrol douglas
4493723 in the beginning the cylons had a plan but it didnt account for one thing survivors during the chaotic aftermath of the destruction two powerful cylon agents struggle with plots and priorities on the human ships that got away and among the resistance fighters who were left behind
4493724 i remember when i first got the script where joans roommate came to the office and shes just been fired
4493725 and i remember going wait a minute i dont know how to play this scene joan is being really nice
4493726 i dont think a woman at that time would be office manager and running the whole place if she wasnt driven
4493727 and joan could go out and find a husband quite easily shes an attractive smart successful woman but shes not pursuing that shes doing things that are safe to a certain degree because she cant marry a man whos already married
4493728 she wants it all and yet like many women shes like im a catch im doing all this and what are these guys giving us i think shes a little disillusioned
4493729 as she talked about it you could tell that the memories were coming up in her and that her body was tensing up
4493730 you could tell that watching the show for her was certainly bringing up a lot
4493731 its the initial reading that really takes you by surprise then you just settle in
4493732 i have women coming up to me and saying i love your character
4493733 thats another side of her and i respect that in joan she says and does things that i would never allow myself to do sometimes i think theyre nuts and sometimes i admire the actions she takes
4493734 evil lords corrupted by wealth and power and armies of cyclopean guards aided by fierce battle stags all bent on keeping the galaxys life sustaining yeast from our heros grasp

4493737 dna evidence and all sorts of technology and here he is thrust into a world where theres a whole other kind of ethos to everything and so those stories i think will be sort of endless for us
4493738 you should lower your expectations then you will love it
4493739 i hope people know that everything i do is just about people
4493740 why does the female black widow spider eat the male after mating
4493741 you boys and girls in a state of suspended adolescence you sicken me
4493742 this is like bringing a banjo on stage after the stones play
4493743 it wont be a guest star it will be somebody who has graced your television screen on our program before
4493744 i dont think it should be seen as an artistic triumph i think it should be seen as someone who as ocd
4493745 its very hard to make things look dirty on tv we do it all the time and its extra effort
4493746 i like to make my own stuff as much as i can i dont like to page through magazines and say oh heres a corner of a room lets replicate that id rather look around and see materials from a bunch of different sources and then put that research aside and just think about stuff
4493747 occasionally i will misfire i did it just the other week
4493748 i had gone off in a direction that was too fancy for one of the sets it was simply a matter of having to paint it back down to a duller color and tear it up a little bit
4493749 right now we have a scene where need a particular kind of vehicle and whats written in a script i think didnt exist then
4493750 ill have a remembrance but ill have to go back and check research and say is this right or is this a unique thing i saw when i was young
4493751 im literally waiting for the first person to talk about how overrated it is
4493752 matt lays a lot of track like he did in season 1
4493753 and the payoffs come fast and furious as they did in season 1
4493754 you get to see what you dont get to see on most tv shows
4493755 you get to see them with these different faces and then finally you get to see them alone loneliness is part of the show because i think its part of the human condition
4493756 its sort of nefarious but its dignified theres no one going on maury povich and saying i slept with my mother and her sister secrets today are given no value because everything is exposed whereas then everything was secret and on three martinis too
4493757 a lot of the information that the audience gets right away no one else has
4493758 that was the suspense is this situation going to explode how could she not know does she know
4493759 to me the mystery and suspense on the show and almost everything on the show comes from the tension between the different people we are the different selves we are
4493760 an ambitious charismatic assistant district attorney who comes from one of miamis most politically powerful and beloved families
4493761 he and dexter set something in motion neither can pull back
4493762 hes going to own the code and become more of his own mad this season
4493763 itd be funny if i was called in for a csi case and all i did was help them solve a crime
4493764 the torchwood team has never been in this much jeopardy
4493765 executive producer michael green read the profanity spiked text messages from mcshane aloud to the crowd which responded with waves of laughter
4493766 the fact is there are echoes of what happened before with firefly so some people are worried
4493767 my response to that is first of all thanks im glad you care and also you can be worried the show could have all the support in the world from fox and still not be successful theres no guarantees in this business the fact is their support hasnt wavered but they did sort of view what id done as a little bit different from what id sold
4493768 i looked at the first pilot with a very cold eye an executives eye and said ok i know what they want that they dont have
4493769 i asked them do you want a new pilot earlier and they said no no no we just want to figure out how to make this work i said heres how youre going to make this work im going to write you a new one they were very grateful
4493770 no matter how free they feel coming and going from the dollhouse in essence they are completely tracked
4493771 we wanted a very nurturing environment and thats why we went with spa spa spa in the d cor
4493772 we wanted natural elements we wanted to do anything that would say this is not anything but a happy harmonious home dont ask any questions
4493773 coming back but may not have the ability to speak
4493774 oh is this too much hype will there be a backlash
4493775 the bush administrations failed energy economic and foreign policies have led to gas prices jumping over 250 percent in less than eight years and doubling this year alone with big oil profits nearly mirroring those huge price increases
4493776 after years of the same failed ideas a lack of any real energy plan and an inability to pass meaningful legislation we need a new kind a leadership that can create real change through meaningful solutions
4493777 as gas prices continue to rise towards 4 00 a gallon we need to ask where all the additional money is going its not going to local retailers and small business owners like mac brownson its not staying here in the capital region to support our local economy and its not even staying in new york state and if state or federal leaders impose a tax holiday it wont go towards meeting our budget gaps or providing services either actually its nearly all going and will continue to go towards big oils record breaking profits and we need to do something about it
4493778 we need leaders in congress like tracey brooks who truly understand our problems in the capital region and understand that when big oil companies jack up their prices it hurts all of us
4493779 i dont control gas prices and tracey brooks gets it shes asking the right questions and has good solutions to finally change the direction were heading in
4493780 we can no longer have a government that puts the profits of oil companies ahead of the needs of the people and thats why im proposing a plan that addresses the real causes of the problem
4493781 i have been bringing our message of change to all seven counties of the district meeting with families listening to their concerns about gas prices and talking about the need for new priorities in washington and new leaders who can make real change happen here in the capital region
4493782 after another record breaking quarter of big oil profits todays siena poll showing that 70 percent of us are paying more for gas and food and with local gas prices already touching 4 00 its clear that we need change in washington and help here in the capital region
4493783 the bush administrations failed energy economic and foreign policies have led to a weakening economy with stagnant wages continued job loss and a looming recession
4493784 republicans in washington and albany continue to fight for the status quo after thirty years of the same failed ideas a lack of any real energy plan and an inability to pass meaningful legislation they should have learned their lesson we need a new kind a leadership that will be effective and make real change to keep gas prices in check
4493785 we can start with short term conservation practices like providing tax incentives for fuel efficient cars maintaining air pressure in our tires and walking or car pooling more but we really need to address the long term fundamental issues
4493786 we need to start by bringing our troops home from iraq and reinvesting the wars 12 billion monthly price tag right back here at home we must end tax loopholes for oil companies and instead invest in alternative fuels and renewable energy we must continue to push the auto industry to increase gas mileage and we absolutely must end this eight year practice of unnecessary price gouging on the part of big oil companies
4493787 im committed to helping solve this problem by fighting to reduce our dependence on oil calling for smart investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency technology that will create green jobs here in the capital region
4493788 we can no longer have a government that puts the profits of oil companies ahead of the needs of the people
4493789 two militants attempted to flee and were pursued by coalition military working dogs
4493790 both militants received dog bite injuries one of which required treatment on scene by coalition medical personnel

4493795 they are not allowed to participate in any campaign conversations about the issues for which they lobby which would seem to pose a conflict for someone like mr scheunemann his work as a foreign agent could overlap on any number of issues with his foreign policy advice
4493796 now the task of all republicans is on uniting the party to help elect john mccain not on sowing division
4493797 we made it clear that we want huckabee to be recognized

4493800 400 years of opera a quick survey of western civilizations fascination with dramatic music
4493801 verdi a long life of opera composing simple to complex
4493802 when we lived there there was no one on the island that we didnt know
4493803 my goal in teaching any classes but especially the opera classes is to direct the attention of the participants to see and hear things in a more acute way than they might do without that guidance
4493804 i talk about the challenge and task of the composer and times in which they live as well as the music why this instrument why this tempo or rhythm whats going on in the musical pattern
4493805 orchestras had more instruments opera houses were large and elaborate audiences had sophisticated and demanding tastes and music composition was leaving the safety of traditional harmony and rhythm i want the people who attend my class to leave with educated ears this year i will use a lot of video it is available and i have changed my mind about my former prejudice which was that those who look forget to listen actually seeing the action enhances the listening and we can add the directors interpretation to the discussion of the opera
4493806 with the great new facilities in the community center auditorium it would be a waste not to show these films
4493807 i like the lecture and seminar idea here on the island with a choice of one or all i like the size of the seminars and i love the special treatment that the faculty is given by the residents it is all very nice and a real model for the new hot adventure in retirement lifelong learning

4493825 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4493826 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4493827 i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4493828 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw
4493829 when you were discharged no one really gave a hoot about you it was difficult for a compassionate person like jim to forget what he saw he was a hero
4493830 by creating lwuit sun is reaffirming its commitment to the mobile development community and by open sourcing the lwuit code we are enabling mobile developers to quickly and easily create rich portable interfaces for their applications
4493831 this software will also help address the mobile industrys fragmentation issue by enabling developers to create a single interface that will work anywhere java is found
4493832 to further accelerate the adoption of the lwuit framework it is important to provide access to the source code under a liberal and well known open source license
4493833 this license choice provides the benefits of open source innovation and collaborative development while offering a risk free path to adoption by commercial products a model everybody should feel very comfortable with

4493838 my goal remains to professionalize our inspections divisions through increased and ongoing training
4493839 as with the residential inspectors this was not the outcome we had hoped for but we must move forward with a professionalized staff
4493840 this is a complete sham to cover up management failures
4493841 it is no secret that dcra is a mess this is endemic to what weve seen in other d c agencies and frankly we are concerned as there is no legal reason why these inspectors should be fired

4493866 we have no way of monitoring or preventing brokers and lenders from violating some of these new requirements
4493867 we dont like foreclosure but at the end of the day this law would affect our ability to manage our losses and protect ourselves against violations by brokers and lenders
4493868 eliminating a homeowners right to raise violation of law as defense to foreclosure would hurt an already vulnerable homeowner and would render the law useless there would be no enforcement mechanism
4493869 we think its going to mean that mortgages originated in new york in the future are more credit worthy than the subprime mortgages that have been originated in the last five years

4493874 it helps to answer a perplexing question how can there be gay genes given that gay sex doesnt lead to procreation
4493875 the answer is remarkably simple the same gene that causes men to like men also causes women to like men and as a result to have more children
4493876 the positive effect of an x linked gene on female fecundity tends to outweigh the negative effect of the gene on male fecundity
4493877 we understand that the genetic component has to interact with something to produce different phenotypes
4493878 genetics is not determining the sexual orientation its only influencing it
4493879 the results showed that the maternal aunts grandmothers and mothers of both bisexual men and homosexuals had more children than those of heterosexual men

4493885 a believer is a one who is so peaceful for others that he is known to be trustworthy as far as their lives holdings and properties are concerned he should be a peaceful and trustworthy man among the society only he deserves to be declared as a muslim

4493887 if at first you dont succeed so much for skydiving

4493889 its very democratic everyone works on the plot when they have time but most people come along on sunday afternoons
4493890 the idea is that the garden is as sustainable as possible its based on the principle of permaculture we make the most of the space by growing potatoes in stacks of tyres rather than just in flat beds for example
4493891 the social scene is amazing everyone is really friendly and we always welcome new recruits the night where we received the award for top club was an incredible achievement for the club and possibly the best night out of the year
4493892 bums is one of the most active of all 190 societies at the university
4493893 we have a great social side as well as some really great performances
4493894 it is great to be voted best by the students in these awards
4493895 w e want to promote awareness of other cultures within the british environment but we also have the craziest parties
4493896 i am in much better shape than that im really hard on myself though maybe its because its my first heptathlon of the year i have just not taken advantage of the situation
4493897 overall its a solid performance its kind of just average for me
4493898 im in the mix but i expected to win that 200 in under 23 seconds
4493899 ive come to the olympic games and have made the semi final now i just want to go home and sleep and get ready for the semi final and hopefully surprise everybody and make the final
4493900 i didnt feel intimidated i belong there in that company im very confident and if i can make a good start i know i can make it
4493901 thats been my luck this year i am just distraught
4493902 i knew it was going to be a tough task with the world record holder the european number one and the american number three in the same heat and my aim was to come fourth and qualify as the fastest loser
4493903 im gutted with the whole year ive pulled my hamstring twice and now i was screwed up by the lane draw which i dont think i deserved but im a professional i am going to allow myself just five minutes to wallow in it and then im going to pick myself up and focus on the relay
4493904 hes right there is no outright favourite but at the moment i am only in the semis and there is a long way to go yet im treating that as the next final so i am not looking any further ahead
4493905 it felt good and im really pleased with that there has been a lot of waiting and that has been quite nerve wracking but once i got out there i felt really good
4493906 i was expecting to have to run a personal best to be within a sniff of qualifying so i am very pleased ive done that but i just wished i had made it to the final
4493907 it would be good for the sport if he loses

4493920 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
4493921 unfortunately russia has tended to view the extension of freedom and democracy as a threat to its interests
4493922 we can only regret that at this very difficult time the u s side is further aggravating relations between the u s and russia
4493923 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4493924 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia this is about getting russian troops out
4493925 with current opec production well above the expected demand for opec crude there is potential for a sharp build in crude oil inventories

4493936 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4493937 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4493938 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4493939 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

4493942 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4493943 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4493944 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4493967 the softening economic situation has led to a further slowdown in oil demand growth
4493968 due to a major slowdown in transport and industrial fuel consumption not only in north america but also in europe and pacific industrialised nations oil demand growth will be on the decline in 2009 which will make the world oil demand growth the lowest since 2002
4493969 in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4493970 to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communications and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4493971 you have heard the statement by the us president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
4493972 it means that georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the us defense ministry

4493974 reshaping us policy toward russia will take longer than the months between now and january 20 when a new president takes office but mr bush can at least atone for his earlier misjudgments about mr putin and steer policy in a new direction that his successor would have to deal with

4494078 for a number of reasons berkshires results for interim periods are not normally indicative of results to be expected for the year the timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be relatively more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year variations in the amounts and timing of investment gains losses can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings investment gains losses are recorded when investments are sold other than temporarily impaired or in instances as required under gaap when investments are marked to market in addition changes in the fair value of derivative assets liabilities associated with derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment can cause significant variations in periodic net earnings

4494107 tidak ada ghibah bagi ahli bidah dan orang fasik yang menampakkan kesesatan mereka
4494108 ketahuilah bahwa alasan yang membolehkan menyebutkan keburukan orang lain hanya sebatas untuk mewujudkan tujuan syari yang tidak mungkin tercapai kecuali dengan jalan ghibah sehingga bisa menggugurkan dosa ghibah yang demikian itu ada enam perkara dan yang keempat adalah memperingatkan ummat islam dari keburukan ketika ada seorang fakih pandai red sering mendatangi ahli bidah atau fasik dan anda khawatir orang tersebut terjangkiti kefasikan atau kebidahan
4494109 ghibah diperbolehkan dengan tujuan syari yang tidak mungkin dicapai kecuali dengan cara ghibah dan ada enam faktor
4494110 boleh menggunjing ahli bidah bahkan menyebutkan kesesatan mereka baik di hadapan atau di belakang mereka dengan syarat maksud utama adalah untuk menjelaskan kepada khalayak kebidahan mereka itulah yang telah dilakukan ulama salaf baik ghibah tersebut untuk menjawab pertanyaan atau tidak
4494111 dua perkara dimana ghibah dibolehkan pertama orang yang terang terangan menampakkan kejahatannya seperti kezhaliman zina dan kedua adalah kebidahan bila mereka menampakkan kemungkaran wajib dibasmi sebatas kemampuan yang ada barangsiapa yang bermaksiat secara sembunyi sembunyi berarti dia menutupi harga diri dan masih mempunyai rasa malu sehingga wajib menasihati secara sembunyi sembunyi atau didiamkan hingga bertaubat
4494112 apabila seseorang menampakkan kemungkaran wajib dinasihati secara terang terangan dan bukan merupakan suatu ghibah sebab orang yang melakukan kemungkaran secara terang terangan wajib dibasmi secara terang terangan agar berhenti darinya
4494113 bisa diambil kesimpulan hukum bahwa bukan merupakan suatu ghibah membicarakan orang yang menampakkan kefasikan dan keburukan maka para ulama menyatakan dibolehkan menggunjing untuk tujuan syari yang tidak bisa dicapai kecuali dengan cara tersebut
4494114 tidak ada ghibah bagi ahli bidah atau semakna dengan itu agar tidak dipahami secara keliru oleh sebagian orang awam
4494115 orang yang membicarakan ahli bidah hendaknya berniat ikhlas karena allah taala namun bila untuk popularitas atau merusak maka hanya sekedar berjuang untuk membela diri atau riya
4494116 ghibah adalah bila kamu menyebut saudaramu dengan sesuatu yang dibenci
4494117 pendahulu kalian sangat keras terhadap lisan meraka dalam membicarakan ahli bidah sangat takut hati mereka dalam rangka menjelaskan kebidahan mereka apabila mereka melakukan bidah secara sembunyi sembunyi tidak satupun di antar ulama salaf merobek kehormatan mereka yang telah tertutup rapi karena allah taala telah melindungi mereka dengan taubat namun jika mereka secara terang terangan menampakkan kebidahan mempropagandakan kebidahannya sehingga bidah semakin merajalela maka menebar ilmu sebagai sumber kehidupan dan menyampaikan pesan rasul sebagai bentuk rahmat agar menjadi pegangan bagi orang yang terus berbuat jahat dan ilhad menyimpang red di hari kelak
4494118 janganlah kamu menghujat orang yang sudah meninggal dunia karena dia sudah menerima balasan atas yang diperbuat
4494119 jika ahli bidah mati tidak meninggalkan pengikut yang mengkultuskan atau karya tulis yang membahayakan atau tidak ada faktor yang bisa merusak orang lain sebaiknya setelah mati harus tetap dilindungi kehormatannya dijaga aibnya serta urusannya diserahkan kepada allah taala
4494120 hai orang orang yang beriman hendaklah kamu jadi orang orang yang selalu menegakkan kebenaran karena allah menjadi saksi dengan adil
4494121 jika dia tidak sesuai dengan apa yang kamu bicarakan maka kamu telah membuat suatu tuduhan
4494122 iman itu ada enam puluh lebih cabangnya dan malu adalah salah satu cabang iman
4494123 padahal mereka tidak disuruh kecuali supaya menyembah allah dengan memurnikan ketaatan kepada nya dalam menjalankan agama dengan lurus
4494124 sesungguhnya kami menurunkan kepadamu kitab dengan membawa kebenaran maka sembahlah allah dengan memurnikan ketaatan kepada nya ingatlah hanya kepunyaan allah lah agama yang bersih dari syirik
4494125 yang menjadikan mati dan hidup supaya dia menguji kalian siapa di antara kalian yang lebih baik amalnya
4494126 maksud yang lebih baik amalnya dalam ayat ini adalah yang paling ikhlas dan paling benar
4494127 wahai abu ali apakah amal yang paling ikhlas dan paling benar itu
4494128 sesungguhnya jika amal itu ikhlas namun tidak benar maka ia tidak diterima jika amal itu benar namun tidak ikhlas maka ia tidak akan diterima hingga amal itu ikhlas dan benar yang ikhlas ialah yang dikerjakan karena allah dan yang benar ialah yang dikerjakan menurut as sunnah
4494129 barangsiapa mengharap perjumpaan dengan rabbnya maka hendaklah ia mengerjakan amal yang shalih dan janganlah ia mempersekutukan seorang pun dalam beribadah kepada rabbnya
4494130 dan siapakah yang lebih baik agamanya daripada orang yang ikhlas menyerahkan dirinya kepada allah sedang dia pun mengerjakan kebaikan
4494131 dan kami hadapi segala amal yang mereka kerjakan lalu kami jadikan amal itu bagaikan debu yang beterbangan
4494132 sesungguhnya sekali kali engkau tidak akan dibiarkan hingga engkau mengerjakan suatu amal untuk mencari wajah allah melainkan engkau telah menambah kebaikan derajad dan ketinggian karenanya
4494133 tiga perkara yang hati orang mukmin tidak akan berkhianat jika ada padanya amal yang ikhlas karena allah menyampaikan nasihat kepada para waliyul amri dan mengikuti jamaah orang orang muslim karena doa mereka meliputi dari arah belakang mereka
4494134 orang yang berperang agar kalimat allah lah yang paling tinggi maka dia berada di jalan allah

4494138 sesungguhnya allah tidak melihat tubuh kalian dan tidak pula rupa kalian tetapi dia melihat hati kalian
4494139 meninggalkan amal karena manusia adalah riya mengerjakan amal karena manusia adalah syirik sedangkan ikhlas ialah jika allah memberikan anugerah kepadamu untuk meninggalkan keduanya
4494140 ikhlas merupakan rahasia antara allah dan hamba yang tidak diketahui kecuali oleh malaikat sehingga dia menulis nya tidak diketahui syetan sehingga dia merusaknya dan tidak pula diketahui hawa nafsu sehingga dia mencondongkannya

4494148 ya rasulullah dosa dosamu yang lalu dan akan datang telah diampuni oleh allah mengapa engkau harus bersusah payah dalam beribadah dan taat kepada allah hingga tumitmu bengkak dan pecah pecah
4494149 apakah tidak boleh aku bersyukur atas segala karunia yang allah berikan kepadaku dia yang menghidupkanku dari tiada menjadi ada apakah tidak boleh aku bersyukur sementara allah telah menganugerahkan kepadaku akal pikiran pemahaman dan kenabian apakah tidak boleh aku bersyukur kepada allah yang telah memberikanku taufiq dan bimbingan nya untuk selalu taat apakah tidak boleh aku bersyukur kepada allah yang telah menerima taatku dan ibadahku

4494245 for the next month things will be quiet because we are now in the hungry ghost festival period but over the next half year i think we still see strong demand in the mass market because rentals for mass market properties are still doing well home loans remain relatively cheap and with the job situation looking really sound upgraders will continue to be available in the market looking for mass market private condos
4494246 for the whole market although theres an increase in the number of units launched for sale since may this year the number of units sold by developers although they are climbing but theyre climbing at a slower rate in the months ahead theres going to be a lack of major suburban projects that are launched for sale at least for the rest of 2008 so we expect the number of units launched for sale to gradually dwindle and at the same time i think the number of units sold would also follow suit

4494251 talks are under way and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf
4494252 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4494253 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4494254 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4494255 he is ready to resign but he is putting conditions like indemnity for the november 3 action
4494256 backdoor talks are still going on things have not yet been finalised lets see what happens
4494257 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4494258 only a few people are still with him and he only wants two things indemnity for the sins and crimes he committed in the past eight years and a piece of land so he can live rest of his life there

4494270 for our gospel to be jesus gospel it must move it must be embodied faith without works is dead of course
4494271 but works outside the context of the proclamation of the gospel isnt the gospel at all
4494272 the danger within the new church movements even as we seek to be the gospel in healing comforting clothing and feeding is that we practically confuse our good works for the gospel of christs good work

4494304 this scale is 10 times larger than what was being talked about awhile ago
4494305 this makes large scale solar an increasingly likely and large part of the energy portfolio in california and the west
4494306 we will continue to explore such innovative technologies as we aggressively work to increase the amount of renewable energy we provide our customers
4494307 if they can get the costs down to the range theyre talking about that would be a real major step
4494308 but we dont know exactly what the numbers are because theyre not being made public im wondering why there isnt more transparency in this
4494309 a power purchase contract is one thing but where are the bankers
4494310 they are going to need hundreds of millions of dollars
4494311 this is a recurring problem states have during every recession
4494312 there is good support for fiscal relief by several key members of congress such as rep john dingell d of michigan
4494313 but it all depends on whether congress does a second fiscal stimulus package and that is looking increasingly doubtful with president bush saying he would veto any more fiscal stimulus
4494314 you can define who to cover and how to set rates
4494315 many doctors were forced to stop seeing new medical patients or in some cases existing ones
4494316 the reimbursement rate for a regular 15 minute visit was 24 which is below the cost of providing care
4494317 that means an adult making 14 500 a year the equivalent of the minimum wage would not be getting healthcare
4494318 some of the rural hospitals are on the edge of bankruptcy
4494319 i had one rural hospital with 40 beds 39 of them for long term patients tell me they can go two more weeks before they have to shut their doors
4494320 some would have to cut back services others would be forced to close their doors
4494321 in the past it is my understanding the unions have been quite successful at blunting cutbacks
4494322 this is a case where the traditional foes the institutions and the workers are together on the same side and it multiplies the influence
4494323 its amazing how hard it can be to come up with 25 when everything is going up in price
4494324 drinking and smoking while riding is for professionals only do not attempt
4494325 it seems normal to do things that still strike other parts of the country as awfully different
4494326 we never considered renting a car because its so compact and easy to get around
4494327 for the average american these inflation numbers are very bad news it means that their purchasing power has been cut and their wages arent going very far
4494328 this will be the single biggest step we can take to improve air quality in the gorge
4494329 they should have dealt with this facility a long time ago
4494330 now they have a once in a lifetime chance to get this right
4494331 you can smell the smoke and pollution in the air and it sits there for weeks at a time
4494332 thats where a lot of the heat is going to be thats where the biggest rubs in the system are it doesnt necessarily translate into there being more development theres some belief on the part of some folks that that will be what happens but thats not what our recommendation is
4494333 i dont think we can afford that in terms of public services we still need to focus on how to prevent that outcome
4494334 i just dont understand the logic in these valuations i have a business degree and i just dont get it
4494335 looking at all the reports in the national media theyre expecting a reduction and theyre getting an increase
4494336 thats the most prevalent thing were hearing its certainly understandable
4494337 that is pretty much what we do all the time we play catch up
4494338 theyre walking a thin line im walking a thin line my taxes will go up from 11 000 to 17 000 by my calculation thats about 430 a month my wages arent going up that much
4494339 our responsibility is to value the property at market what we believe is what you could sell the property for in january using the best information we have available
4494340 part of the value of the appeal process is it gives us an opportunity to take another look at the property
4494341 the laws of supply and demand still work and both producers and consumers will adjust their choices
4494342 what biofuels are causing in one market will have ramifications in another market
4494343 i wouldnt buy an ibm in 1980 and hold onto it for 10 years
4494344 were kind of at the stage with biofuels where we were in early computers
4494345 they were big they were clunky they werent as efficient as wed like them to be looking back they looked pretty silly compared to what we have now but you gotta start somewhere with this stuff
4494346 what corn ethanol is doing is creating a market for ethanol
4494347 but its creating a market that in the long run will be good for the world
4494348 a lot of people are hopeful that well have some breakthrough
4494349 but currently we dont have a low cost way to do that
4494350 the biggest challenge right now is scaling up from a few hundred gallons to 40 million gallons or more the question becomes how many years before we get to that stage a rough indicator would be between three and five years some people place it out as far as 10 its kind of all over the map
4494351 would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
4494352 but were not doing it the chinese are in cooperation with the cuban government even the communists have figured out that a good answer to high prices is more supply
4494353 china thanks to a lease issued by cuba is drilling for oil
4494354 even china recognizes that oil and natural gas is readily available off our shores thanks to fidel castro theyve been given a permit to drill for oil
4494355 cnooc to participate in cuban resource exploitation cnooc is chinese national offshore oil corporation its a dead link now they probably pulled it when the story hit the us press so it could be easily denied by anti independence advocates i suspect they have pulled the link by now too
4494356 the intent behind it is not only to do activities but to really make young people teens included informed users of the environment so they can take responsibility and make informed decisions
4494357 the san francisco bay is alive and it is critical to protect it
4494358 when youre teaching people about their own community and in this case its about their watershed it also helps to get outside
4494359 beginning last year we resolved there would be no more driving to school and driving home
4494360 we found we could cover 10 miles a day as a family without much challenge
4494361 they really helped bridge the gap from what was just going on at school to what was going on at home too
4494362 i think its just funner um more fun than riding in a car all day
4494363 instead of sitting down all buckled up you get to feel the air and see pretty plants
4494364 ive seen him up in the zone a lot more with everything and because of that his secondary stuff is not playing
4494365 well have to re evaluate him and see how we can get him going again
4494366 as coisas podem chegar at aqueles que esperam mas s o somente as sobras deixadas por aqueles que lutam
4494367 youd be real embarrassed if he won and you wasnt down with it
4494368 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
4494369 during lunch mccain said almost with mischievous glee that he had slipped some highly technical questions to james mcclure to ask mofford questions she wouldnt be prepared to answer or expected to answer
4494370 flabbergasted i asked mccain why would he want to sabotage moffords testimony when in fact the cap was the nonpartisan pet of republicans and democrats such as far left udall and far right goldwater since its inception
4494371 his reply as near as i remember was ill embarrass a democrat any time i get the chance
4494372 he traces his environmental awareness to the sainted rep mo udall an arizona democrat who took mccain as a young congressman under his tutelage to environmentalists thats like saying you learned about civil rights by driving around alabama with martin luther king jr
4494373 that was devastating to me that he brought in a reporter i thought that was crossing the line and it destroyed me
4494374 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
4494375 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
4494376 we have got to fight it with everything weve got
4494377 put simply we cannot let the liberals take this country back to the tax and spend policies of the past
4494378 it will drive up the price of everything transportation groceries electricity heating even propane for our bbqs
4494379 theres a reason it didnt mention the carbon tax policy
4494380 thats because its a bad policy for atlantic canada it would hurt families here it would hurt industries here and thats why theyre not talking about it
4494381 i see mr dion has been threatening to defeat the government again this summer i am starting to feel like i am starring alongside bill murray in the movie groundhog day
4494382 as humorous as mr dions behaviour has been this spectacle of his threatening to defeat the government then backing down has to end
4494383 lets pollute the air for humans too while we kill off all the animals
4494384 if approved the changes would represent the biggest overhaul of the endangered species act since 1988 they would accomplish through regulations what conservative republicans have been unable to achieve in congress ending some environmental reviews that developers and other federal agencies blame for delays and cost increases on many projects
4494385 the administration also tried to jettison the entire rule outright a gambit that was struck down in court though legal action continues more recently bush appointees have worked on rescinding the rule one state at a time
4494386 it has launched rollback processes in idaho and colorado two states with more than 13 million roadless areas between them in each state they are pursuing phony replacement rules shot full of loopholes that would jeopardize millions and millions of wildland acres
4494387 stay home have an iced tea or whatever and dont mow your lawn
4494388 help avoid the misuse of the esa to regulate climate change
4494389 its not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
4494390 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4494391 we have a quite a few patients that come from yelm and hopefully the lacey clinic will serve some of them
4494392 theres a shift taking place in this country away from using shelters as a response to homelessness
4494393 communities had been told the land was theirs now its contested
4494394 they were told by the government go out and prospect
4494395 you dont want to be a hostile element in the environment its an investor choice you see a lot of abuse
4494396 in places like ghana you can do all sorts of things you can take a logging concession you can strip the land and destroy it give nothing back to local communities
4494397 theres been very little effort to make sure that any of that money actually gets down to communities as opposed to being captured by local elites
4494398 carbon markets could be the match that sets it all off
4494399 it will encourage the resolution of disputed land claims a lot of these are not being resolved simply out of inertia
4494400 even in the diamond business consumers and producers found out that people get angry wont buy from conflict areas the oil and gas industry are dealing in commodities which are very hard to trace by and large carbon offsets are much more exposed to public scrutiny subject of legislation
4494401 theres no point in blaming bankers wanting to make profits
4494402 our job as an international community is to make sure these markets work effectively to deliver carbon sequestration protect indigenous peoples rights and deliver ecosystem services
4494403 we get a certificate of analysis for every batch of fuel delivered like a birth certificate for our fuel we know how its made and how far its coming from
4494404 our supplier wont tell us exactly what the blends are
4494405 but what are we going to do just say were completely dependent on petroleum and leave it at that were on the first generation of biofuels when the first ibm mainframe came out and used up an entire room did we throw it out no we evolved it were learning how this fuel works
4494406 algae needs no fresh water doesnt displace any cropland and eats nitrogen and carbon dioxide
4494407 youre educating a whole wave of consumers once algae becomes available theyll be eager to use it because theyll understand that its possible to fuel their cars with something other than petroleum
4494408 dead zones were once rare but now theyre commonplace and there are more of them in more places
4494409 but things can change and theres no guarantee that we wont be seeing blooms of algae in the future here too so we need to be really vigilant
4494410 a sobering documentation of the growing threat of nutrient pollution in coastal waters around the world
4494411 the conclusion is inescapable that dead zones are now a key stressor in coastal waters
4494412 the evidence suggests that if the spigot of nutrients can be turned off coastal systems can recover
4494413 doing it can be accomplished by using fertilizers more efficiently preventing human and animal sewage from entering rivers and replanting vegetation along riverbanks to absorb excess nutrients
4494414 however nutrient inputs are again rising there as agriculture expands and a return to hypoxic conditions may be imminent
4494415 they dramatically reduce energy use greenhouse gas emissions and are recyclable
4494416 i think a lot of folks had their minds made up
4494417 people always think how can he do this how can i not if i see something my fellow democrats are pitching thats not right how can i not go after them
4494418 by the time a lot of stuff makes it to the ocean especially portland its probably broken down a little bit into smaller pieces
4494419 bags are easy to pick up a bag that breaks down into 5 000 little pieces is very problematic
4494420 just because you cant see it doesnt mean its not a problem
4494421 there are places in the ocean where plastic outnumbers plankton 6 to 1
4494422 its not about hurting anyone campaigning against the plastic industry
4494423 we forget about reduce and reuse i can understand the industrys perspective but in the big picture of society as a whole we need to look at using less first
4494424 but there is symbolic value in talking about it it helps people understand that recycling is good but using less in the first place is even better
4494425 should we be looking for a ban or tax on plastic bags in portland
4494426 should we be looking for a regional or statewide solution
4494427 i acknowledge and accept that right now i am feeling like i am catching a cold
4494428 right now i am feeling really wonderful i feel great i feel healthy vibrant on top of the world
4494429 right now i have a cash flow constriction or right now i am pretty much broke
4494430 right now i am extremely wealthy right now all my means are being met right now i have more than most on the planet right now i am really prosperous and fortunate
4494431 i would suggest that by leaving egypt moses amp thy fathers and thy father s fathers did boundary cross
4494432 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses
4494433 were going to have a lot of the basics on the menu some really nice salads at lunchtime thai chicken salad and shrimp salads
4494434 and some of the pizzas we made popular at corleones flatbread pizzas are a big seller for us and some nice corned beef and french dip sandwiches
4494435 for dinnertime im hoping well get into a harry carays kind of place
4494436 expect to find 20 big screen tvs a draft beer system featuring at least 15 to 20 specialty drafts and local brews as well as a radio transmission area where golic can do live broadcasts
4494437 the top factor is a place that is environmentally friendly where people have a green mindset
4494438 portland is ideally suited as a potential port of entry for byd
4494439 we have the distribution network we have the capacity and we have the capability
4494440 even if all they do is set up a corporate headquarters it will be a big benefit to the area
4494441 we hope to sell 3 000 f6 cars a month this year and the monthly sales could reach 100 000 cars next year
4494442 no one will talk on the record about any potential move of tribe prospects from buffalo to columbus
4494443 the process has been outlined well go through september and then people will talk
4494444 but i would have my head in the sand to think there arent some back channel things going on
4494445 we have been screwing up the ocean with plastic for 50 to 60 years the fact that weve done it so fast and that it has penetrated so low into the food chain is alarming but were just beginning to make a scientific assessment of what this means
4494446 this issue is so important and so relevant and so underreported
4494447 canary in the coal mine people should be concerned about the degradation of the aquatic system because if it goes life as we know it is going to go
4494448 mouse fish rat or human the mechanisms developed over hundreds of millions of years of evolution and are extremely similar across all vertebrates if they can be harmed so can we
4494449 negligible concern that exposure of pregnant women to bisphenol a will result in fetal or neonatal mortality birth defects or reduced birth weight and growth in their offspring
4494450 at exposure levels far in excess of those experienced by humans
4494451 this is 1 000 times higher than the ability of the cells to respond to this chemical there is clearly no safe amount
4494452 you dont have to have a phd or be a physician to know that estrogenizing males and blocking testosterone is going to wreak havoc
4494453 the ocean really needs us to embody a zero waste culture on land
4494454 thats the only way she is going to heal herself
4494455 when we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us we often find that it is those who instead of giving much advice solutions or cures have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a gentle and tender hand the friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement who can tolerate not knowing not curing not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness that is a friend who cares
4494456 come what may today im going to smile anyway everything is going to die everything is going to vanish and disappear so what who cares let me at least be happy smile this moment enjoy my very breath

4494458 half of the lower level seats in the 19 275 seat ford center will cost 50 or less three quarters of upper level tickets 5 000 seats will cost 20 or less the nba mandates that all teams offer at least 500 tickets for 10 oklahoma city will offer nearly seven times that many with 3 400 upper level 10 tickets despite thousands of reasonably priced seats oklahoma citys average ticket price 47 51 is close to last years league average 48 83 that was compiled by team marketing report premier seats in the lower bowl nearly doubled in price compared to season tickets two years ago when the new orleans hornets played most of their home games in the ford center following hurricane katrina
4494459 for the first time since the new orleans hornets moved to new orleans in 2002 the team has sold more than 10 000 season tickets and is close to selling out the entire lower bowl area of the new orleans arena
4494460 were within 100 tickets of a lower bowl sellout and weve always said thats a significant objective
4494461 and the other very significant goal which is unprecedented for us in this market is surpassing 10 000 season tickets
4494462 everyone in utah know about williams and boozer who despite what fans in cleveland believe is a thoughtful person who knows how to deal with the media and who possesses a team first attitude born from playing for krzyzewski at duke and jerry sloan with the jazz beyond the two jazz players i can tell you this about paul redd and bosh i have never interviewed any nba players who are more low key respectful and professional if you asked me to produce a top 10 list of players who exemplify what every nba team wants from its young cornerstone type stars paul redd and bosh would be among the first id nominate the bottom line barring injury or foul trouble i dont expect boozers playing time will increase much as the olympics proceed
4494463 he has seen the great wall and been impressed by its scope and its history he has met swimmers and track stars and shared stories with the other great athletes at the olympics
4494464 i know im digging a hole for myself with the raptors and everything because the expectations are going to be there
4494465 i can play defense and i can play a different role
4494466 victories over iran on saturday and russia on monday would allow argentina to avoid both the united states and defending world champion spain in the first game of the knockout round which will match the top team from one group with the fourth place team from the other and the second place team with the third place from the opposite group
4494467 weve gotten ourselves up off the floor from an opening loss to lithuania and were on our way
4494468 the numbers are staggering the u s allowed 136 2 points per 100 possessions in the 2006 loss to greece in this matchup that was shaved down by a half a point per possession with greece averaging 86 7 points per 100 possessions it all started with the defense on the pick and roll which greece famously ran 42 times in the 2006 victory because of that i started charting how the usa defended pick and rolls early in the game ultimately stopping midway through the fourth quarter when the game was well in hand overall i counted 23 pick and rolls in that span that led directly to offensive action on those 23 opportunities greece scored four times for a total of nine points or 39 1 points per 100 possessions i dont know if its possible to put into context how good that is because it is unthinkable for a team so talented to struggle so much in a key area of the game
4494469 spain can hang with the u s at point guard and center but where the u s has a huge advantage is at the two forward spots spains alex mumbru felipe reyes and carlos jimenez will be overmatched in both size and speed against james wade and carmelo anthony which should create openings for the others the spanish also arent as overtly physical as the greeks which should help the finesse heavy american side however spain will be able to handle the americans ball pressure much better than other opponents have its important for the u s not to gamble too much that means you dwyane because calderon and ace three point shooter juan carlos navarro will burn them

4494482 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4494552 it has it all as a story and whichever publisher is lucky enough to secure the rights is going have a red hot hit on their hands
4494553 people are already suggesting she writes fiction as well in the future and that is very much in our thinking
4494554 this is not a one book proposition patsy is a whole publishing brand waiting on the launch pad
4494555 add in her family background her no holds barred style and it will be one of the hottest books of 2009 with the same appeal as best sellers such as russell brands my booky wook piers morgans dont you know who i am

4494560 it is disappointing that the issues with this years national curriculum test results have meant that the partnership between qca and ets europe must end early
4494561 ets europe has apologised to schools for the delays in marking national curriculum assessments in england

4494662 my feeling about the independent business is for one thing its cyclical and were at the low end of the cycle but i think itll go back up and i think its actually very good to launch a project at the low end of the cycle if you can launch it and i think that often when things are bad the way i like to look at it to make it seem better is that bad situations are just business opportunities and theres just a huge opportunity now to make good independent films and have them successfully released ultimately because theres no easy money now and everyone i think is going to be in a much tighter more serious game and i think that the person or the company that steps up to finance our film is going to do very well with it

4494784 i love thor i always have done since i first read those kirby stories as a kid so yes im literally buzzing that im doing this
4494785 im a great fan of the new series and have a hard act to follow in the renditions of thor that olivier coipel and marko djurdjevic have put out there but i dont think anyone is going to be disappointed with my take on thor
4494786 my drawing style has developed a bit since those days so it will look different in the first instance
4494787 my thor is very much a led zeppelin iii kind of thor
4494788 its very power metal lots of power chords huge riffs and epic colossal guitar noises so its grim but its only grim as all things awesome have to get a little grim before they get awesome
4494789 i love matts work and as a massive led zep fan myself i get where hes coming from

4494801 when you talk about fast food restaurants youre thinking burgers and fries and chips and pizza
4494802 i think people sometimes think we have to do something to make ourselves feel good regardless of whether it will have any effect
4494803 no matter how many fast food restaurants the city manages to keep out kids are going to find it somewhere
4494804 this worrying trend highlights the need to provide racially diverse and low income communities with healthier eating options and to take steps to curtail the increase in high fat low nutrition options like fast food
4494805 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronised with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4494806 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac line up worldwide
4494807 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4494808 indeed the drama of the saloon is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centreline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4494809 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category

4494877 state and local laws prohibit landlords from evicting tenants or shutting off utilities due to a foreclosure but not all renters are aware of the rules and not all of the entities that take control of properties try to learn them
4494878 the issue was virtually unheard of a year ago the san francisco tenants union had to circulate a memo to its counselors earlier this year because few had ever encountered it before the exact number of tenants dealing with the aftermath of a landlord foreclosure is difficult to ascertain three tenants groups contacted by the chronicle reported around 130 cases this year but most counselors believe that many more tenants arent contacting the organizations what is known is that lenders foreclosed on 492 homes in san francisco during the last year and a half according to dataquick information systems

4494922 we are prepared to do whatever it takes to win a football game in respect of a football game are we ready to kill someone to win a game no because you have to respect the rules in football the beauty in the game is to win in respect of the rules
4494923 can you win the league by playing completely non football i dont believe so historically it is proven that the teams who win the league are the better technical teams
4494924 the leading clubs have a responsibility to try to make the games attractive they can never be a long term target to play a dirty game or one which is not attractive we want to play our game because we feel it is the most efficient way to win
4494925 of course we have lost some players but we have also brought some players we opted for some stability
4494926 lets focus on the short term goals and lets show later on weve learned from when we dropped off last season
4494927 managing the team thats my job and if i felt at any time that was in jeopardy then that is when i would consider it leaving
4494928 weve got a ground to play in right now its a great stadium and when the supporters are behind us its a great place
4494929 we do need a new one but if we havent got it well still have a team so thats not really too big an issue for us at the moment

4494934 i spent some good times at southampton but now i am looking forward to doing something more at watford and i believe the club can get to the premier league
4494935 there have been some people commenting on the team spirit but its a load of nonsense
4494936 we are focused and with any change of manager there will always be different ideas that he brings to the table
4494937 but everyone is enjoying it everyone has a smile on their face and really looking forward to saturday
4494938 the plan is to play in the first game of the season i dont know my involvement because i wont have played pre season but thats the plan
4494939 i dont question that ive always had the desire thats the animal i am i cant question that
4494940 i said some time ago about practice its not a conscious choice any more its something i know that its part of my life and i will do it
4494941 the difficult one will be telling myself to give up certainly not wondering whether now is the time
4494942 maybe someone will have to come in there and decide for me
4494943 my shoulder is really good i dont know when it started feeling bad i think i was getting some pain pre world cup in the six nations 2003
4494944 my neck took control after that and ive not really played since so once i strung some games together there was obviously a problem
4494945 the shoulder problem has been there five years it was quite a long way gone so it was a great idea to get it done
4494946 when i was playing in some games i felt like i had no problem but in others i was waking up really struggling
4494947 it was tough to keep going so when there was an opportunity to get it done in the summer i took it
4494948 i saw many friendly games in pre season and if you say one team or two teams i think you are wrong
4494949 i saw a minimum of eight teams play very well for the champion ship im sure not only chelsea arsenal manchester and liverpool no forget that this season
4494950 many clubs there are good teams that do not arrive in the press and if one team thinks he will win this if we beat chelsea manchester liverpool and i am champion forget it this season
4494951 robinho is a very good player and i like him
4494952 but listen im asked many times about robinho but until now nothing
4494953 hes a very good player and i like him not just me all the coaches in the world like him
4494954 he plays very well but i dont know whats happening look this is not my business its business for the board the men who talk about the clubs and money
4494955 i see jimmy in training every day and i see him working very hard at his game
4494956 i see him very focused and committed to the team so these things dont really tie up
4494957 i havent had any conversations with him since alistair macintosh made it clear that we dont want to be discussing at the moment new contracts for players who have at least two years left on their current ones
4494958 we would rather concentrate on improving our squad and seeing how that improvement pans out then maybe as the contracts go further into their term there will be time for readjustment
4494959 i dont really understand the arguments because if people are trying to suggest jimmy bullard is unhappy then that is not the case
4494960 your obviously a dumb bitch as well letting a man control you like that thats why white guys date foreigners because they are submissive you sure have alot to say now but the other day in front of my store you were as quiet as a mime your big bad boyfriend was doing all of the talking

4494966 you learn to walk at a comfortable slumber proceeding lonely toward sure history you dont remember and its not important so relax dont think about the way i treat you
4494967 i heard like some screaming some times squealing and stuff
4494968 i heard the tires squealing and i saw them kind of drive off and then they pulled back around
4494969 i couldnt see exactly what happened but it looked like they rammed into something
4494970 after we got them back in their cars they took off down the street
4494971 then another car took off down the maverik we turn around then a truck runs into about four of our friends
4494972 there was three individuals in the vehicle and they are all being detained at this time including the driver

4494983 near constant political poison that bill ritter and ken salazar injected into this process
4494984 what we saw today was nothing less than a fire sale and the people of colorado got burned
4494985 the results are probably good for the bidders but the result wasnt anywhere near what it should have been for colorado taxpayers there is a very simple explanation the non stop political attacks on this project by bill ritter and ken salazar raised the political risk premium of this project to the sky and bidders reduced their bids accordingly that cost our state dearly almost certainly one billion dollars
4494986 public documents detail private acreage sales in the same area in the last two years that netted 40 000 to 50 000 per acre
4494987 there is no hocus pocus to estimating colorados loss today its pretty simple arithmetic ken salazar and bill ritter cost colorado a cool billion dollars today
4494988 the cold hard truth is that the political poison that these two injected into the debate got them some headlines in the press but cost our state hundreds and hundreds of of millions of dollars
4494989 it is all about perceived political risk and how that devalues a project like this
4494990 a company looks long and hard at an investment that carries with it the risk of a states governor or senator trying to delay and stop the project it just isnt worth as much
4494991 vamos fazer uma nova licita o em rela o a isso s o contratos antigos de 2004 e 2005 e v o ser examinados caso a caso

4494994 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
4494995 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem

4495062 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4495063 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4495064 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4495065 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the two part harry potter and the deathly hallows will not be affected by this change
4495066 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4495067 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4495068 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4495069 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4495177 in an article that is sure to rock the world of organ donation the highly respected new england journal of medicine nejm has published an article which backs up the objections of various pro life groups as well as some scientists and physicians to certain types of organ donation which involve the removal of vital organs from patients believed to be dead
4495178 as an ethical requirement for organ donation the dead donor rule has required unnecessary and unsupportable revisions of the definition of death
4495179 the uncomfortable conclusion to be drawn from this literature is that although it may be perfectly ethical to remove vital organs for transplantation from patients who satisfy the diagnostic criteria of brain death the reason it is ethical cannot be that we are convinced they are really dead
4495180 although it may be ethical to remove vital organs from these patients we believe that the reason it is ethical cannot convincingly be that the donors are dead

4495186 barangsiapa yang menyimpang dari rasul setelah terang padanya petunjuk itu dan mengikuti jalannya selain mukminin kami akan gabungkan dia dengan orang orang sesat dan kami masukkan dia ke neraka jahannam
4495187 dan berpegang teguhlah kalian semua dengan agama islam ini dan jangan kalian berpecah belah dari agama ini
4495188 dan janganlah kalian mengikuti jalan jalan syubhat dan hawa nafsu niscaya bila kamu ikut jalan jalan itu akan menyimpangkan kalian dari jalan allah
4495189 sungguh sungguh akan datang atas umatku sebagaimana yang telah datang pada bani israil sebagaimana sepasang sandal yang sama ukurannya sehingga kalau dulunya pernah ada di kalangan bani israil yang menzinai ibunya terang terangan niscaya akan ada di umatku ini yang melakukan demikian
4495190 yaitu golongan yang mengikuti jalan hidupku dan jalan hidup para shahabatku
4495191 sesungguhnya kita ahlus sunnah telah tahu adanya islam sempalan dan pokok pokok berbagai golongannya dan sungguh setiap golongan dari mereka terpecah menjadi beberapa golongan walaupun kita tidak mampu mengidentifikasi seluruh nama nama golongan dan madzhab madzhabnya akan tetapi kita dapat melihat dengan jelas bahwa induk induk golongan ini ialah 1 al haruriyyah 2 al qodariyyah 3 al jahmiyyah 4 5 ar rafidhah 6 al jabriyyah sungguh para ulama telah menyatakan bahwa pokok berbagai sempalan yang sesat adalah enam aliran sempalan ini setiap aliran daripadanya terpecah menjadi dua belas aliran sehingga seluruhnya menjadi tujuh puluh dua aliran
4495192 sesungguhnya allah tidaklah mencabut ilmu dengan mencabutnya sekaligus dari hamba hamba nya akan tetapi dia mencabut ilmu dengan mematikan para ulama sehingga tidak tersisa seorang ulama pun maka manusia pun menunjuk para pimpinan mereka orang orang yang bodoh tentang ilmu agama maka mereka pun bertanya tentang agama kepada para pimpinan bodoh ini dan para pimpinan bodoh itupun memberi fatwa tanpa ilmu akibatnya para pimpinan itu sesat dan menyesatkan pengikutnya
4495193 sesungguhnya termasuk tanda tanda kiamat salah satunya ialah ilmu diambil dari orang orang kecil
4495194 orang orang kecil itu ialah yang berbicara tentang agama dari pikirannya sendiri adapun orang kecil yang mengambil ilmu dan menyampaikan dari ulama besar maka tidaklah dia dimasukkan dalam golongan orang orang kecil

4495212 there is none righteous not even one there is none who understands there is none who seeks for god
4495213 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
4495214 surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins
4495215 the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord
4495216 and if anyones name was not found written in the book of life he was thrown into the lake of fire
4495217 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
4495218 salvation is found in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved
4495219 god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he who believes in him is not condemned but he who does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god

4495253 i have studied only up to the 2nd standard when the election dates were announced i was so shy that i did not talk to any men at that time but when i was elected to the panchayat this became a necessity i underwent training from the taluk panchayat and the singamma sreenivasan foundation i will make sure that there is no violence against women in our village and importance is given to girls education eradication of the dowry problem i want to make our village surroundings clean with greenery all around
4495254 i have been able to get seeds and fertilisers at subsidized rates to poor farmers ensuring proper drainage and water facilities construction of farm ponds and check dams for rain water harvesting prior to my entry into politics the situation in the village was not stable as the gram sabhas and gram panchayat meetings were not being conducted properly the social justice committee was not in existence and women did not even go to panchayats
4495255 since my native place is kogaali it was not difficult for me in the election time for campaigning i went to all houses and campaigned for my vote i had not collected any funds from others for the election in the beginning i was not going out of the house and i used to do house work and agriculture work when i got elected things changed automatically and i used to go out interact with people

4495258 before entering politics i was thinking only about my family and my world was my family alone but now things have changed it has taken a turn i feel it is my duty to think about the society

4495301 in any geographic area its a natural phenomenon for oil to peak at some point
4495302 the peak oil theory looks at the u s experience and believes the world will peak also
4495303 as demand increases prices increase and when prices increase companies develop and produce more oil which can slow the peak were getting better at finding oil and more efficient at drilling it
4495304 i dont believe in the cataclysm if you have a sharp drop in production and prices increase you will get major substitutions in the demand for oil
4495305 the problem with the transportation sector is that oil supplies 97 percent of its energy and theres no viable substitute unless the price of oil gets high enough its knocking at that door now and were starting to see tangible indicators of a switch

4495321 collectively these articles provide a stark challenge for psychiatry as a public health discipline most of the disorders assessed by the ncs r have evidence based treatments but the data suggest that these treatments are rarely provided in the community most psychiatrists practice in office based specialty settings yet most patients obtain care in the general medical sector how do patients who receive psychiatric care differ from those who do not how can we improve care outside of the mental health specialty environment given that mental disorders are often life long illnesses that begin in childhood or adolescence how can we ensure care for these patients equivalent to the care for children with juvenile onset diabetes or cystic fibrosis regrettably data from the ncs r indicate that we most often fail to identify illness sufficiently early to intervene and minimize the damaging effects of psychiatric illness on young peoples developmental trajectories with respect to the detection and appropriate treatment of mental illness in the united states the ncs r quantifies the distance yet remaining along the path to ensuring that all americans have access to timely and high quality mental health care
4495322 the value of psychosocial treatments is seriously underestimated by both the public and by other health care professionals it is stunning that in spite of demonstrated efficacy of psychosocial treatments medications for mental disorders are consistently both available and demanded by the public even when more effective psychosocial treatments are available why watch tv although i applaud advertisements that make real the suffering of depression and anxiety disorders where is the public to get information that psychosocial treatments are as effective as biological treatments

4495414 having delivered more than 200 million pairs of replacement contact lenses to our customers world wide we can proudly say that we have never received a report from a customer identifying any health issue of any kind arising from the products we supplied consistent with this we note that no regulatory or professional body has ever identified any actual health or safety issues which they allege arose from the products we have supplied to our customers

4495445 first negative growth in a year and signaling the approach of a recession linked to rising oil prices and an economic slowdown in the united states
4495446 that declining exports and domestic spending caused gross domestic product to contract reversing the annualized 3 2 percent growth logged in the previous quarter to march
4495447 because the gdp growth rate was high in the previous two quarters it looks like the economy is growing moderately but the nominal gdp shows the economy has been shrinking since the first quarter of 2007 the revenue of everybody is dropping the government businesses and individuals im not sure if consumers will be motivated to increase spending under such circumstances
4495448 the growth in exports that helped drag japan from its last recession that lasted throughout the 1990s japan bounced back in the early 2000s ended last quarter as some of the countrys biggest companies including toyota suffered a slowdown in sales in the u s japan is now the third of the major group of seven economies to endure a quarter of contraction this year following italy and canada consumer spending which makes up more than half the countrys economy fell 0 5 percent from the previous quarter
4495449 had been seen as relatively immune to the ravages of the credit crisis that has been hitting the u s and europe its banks were much healthier than those on either side of the atlantic it was benefiting from an export boom to the rest of asia and its economy grew unexpectedly quickly in the first quarter of the year four times the rate of anemic u s growth but although a bad quarter was expected the contraction of japans gross domestic product has jolted everyone out of any complacency that the worlds second largest economy could continue to operate untouched by events elsewhere
4495450 japan which imports most of its energy has been hit by the sharp rise in the prices of oil and other commodities which have squeezed companies and households alike reducing their ability to spend and the economy to grow
4495451 given japans weakness relative to other advanced economies since its credit and housing bubble burst in the early 1990s many economists still saw the bright side
4495452 expect the downturn will be mild compared to what the country experienced in 2001
4495453 the proposal is tucked inside the report from the b c climate action team released last week a document that the government commissioned but is not obliged to accept but the move to carbon neutral housing would cause a revolution in how housing stock will be built in its purest form it would see housing constructed with built in power supplies either solar panels wind turbines or geothermal sources
4495454 new designs that limit energy requirements such as shaded windows and energy efficient appliances are part of the equation the proposal to the province also urges the government to build some flexibility into the carbon neutral requirement by allowing communities to build green energy sources to power individual residences

4495460 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4495461 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4495462 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4495463 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4495464 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4495465 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4495466 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4495467 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4495468 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4495474 theyre asking at least 30 of our mps to send in their cvs and asking if they willing to join the government its an attempt to buy them off
4495475 this crude machiavellian behaviour shows the way mugabe operates he says he is negotiating in good faith and meanwhile hes trying to form an illegitimate government
4495476 i think they are sending a loud and clear message that theyre still the mafia they were the sooner mbeki recognises that the better
4495477 the people behind this are the people in zanu pf dont want an agreement they are desperate zanu pf is divided between the junta who dont want an agreement and a small section that recognises the writing is on the wall and they have to do a deal

4495483 the gain in factory output during july was inconsistent with the 0 1 drop in the manufacturing aggregate hours worked
4495484 the story is one of rebounds from sharp production cuts earlier in the year due to both slowing demand and labor strikes
4495485 the gains now reflect a recovery from strike activity and a seasonal change over to produce 2009 model vehicles
4495486 there was a time with this organization where we had to get back to relevance and improve the brand so we had to be more aggressive
4495487 i was thinking big picture at that time four years ago about how weve got to be relevant how weve got to get people back in the stands
4495488 well were going to have over 4 million in attendance this year our ratings are off the charts were moving into a new stadium for me theres a time to be aggressive and theres a time to be patient this is a time to be patient
4495489 at the time in my opinion i did what i felt needed to be done
4495490 you never know how its going to turn out theres always going to be some uncertainty its not about one individual its about a change in the team like everything else they have to go out and play
4495491 i couldnt do that in the best interest of the organization i couldnt tell you if the guys we would have traded for were going to be doing much better than murphy and evans are doing right now its worked out so far some of the guys that teams were asking for are helping us win here in the major leagues

4495499 the level of growth of repossession orders suggests that we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s
4495500 it is absolutely vital that the government should intervene and require a proper code of conduct to be implemented by mortgage lenders
4495501 this should not just apply to the big banks but to the large number of secondary lenders who are using court action to pursue their debts in a very aggressive way
4495502 the council for mortgage lenders code of conduct should be put on a statutory footing for all repossession actions
4495503 he betrayed families by claiming hed abolished boom and bust and encouraging a spend now pay later culture
4495504 now times are getting tougher thousands are losing their homes because they can no longer make ends meet
4495505 lenders must now act responsibly even if our prime minister has not done so to minimise the number of people losing their homes
4495506 whilst we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s we are making sure the right advice and support is available for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
4495507 as well as expanding free legal representation in county courts for households at risk of repossession we are providing more free debt advice and are working closely with lenders to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort
4495508 these services can make a real difference with more than 80 of repossessions avoided when they are used it is important that families who have concerns seek advice at the earliest opportunity starting by speaking to their lender

4495513 theyre probably in the comfort zone here and are quite happy not to be in the team but to do their little bit and plod along really
4495514 im at a top 10 premiership club why should i go to a newly promoted side or a championship team when i can coin it in here playing the odd reserve game
4495515 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4495516 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4495517 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4495518 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4495519 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4495520 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4495521 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4495522 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4495523 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him

4495526 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4495527 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says and so i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia we will ignore it

4495555 our study reveals potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of smaller scale functional studies
4495556 this segregation of tumors into three groups with distinct expression patterns is surprising clearly the developmental trajectory provides a meaningful background for capturing large scale differences in gene expression across diverse conditions
4495557 shifting our focus from single sets of genes or processes to the biology of aggregates on the order of the entire transcriptome is likely to be useful in establishing highly robust molecular correlations between seemingly unrelated disease phenotypes

4495570 social news sites such as stumbleupon where the community decides what content is worthy and what content isnt are powerful enough to drive tens of thousands of visitors to some lucky content producers and thus have become an incredibly valuable marketing platform one good day on any of these sites can get you more than 60 000 visitors in less than 24 hours
4495571 this person has similar tastes to me so im interested in what theyre interested in
4495572 as far as the players go there has been some concern there is no doubt about that there has been some concern for quite a while now and we as a cricket team are no different to any other australian any australian you bumped into in the street would have some concerns about touring pakistan as well
4495573 some decisions have to be made in the next few days the players you have heard from before still have strong reservations but we will wait and see what happens in the next few days the concerns are still there of course there are a lot of things said that will be put in place and lets hope those things are put in place
4495574 i havent got a decision to make until cricket australia make a decision so it is no different for me than it was six months ago the idea of the meeting today for me was not to come here and decide if i was going to tour pakistan or i wasnt it was to collect as much information as we can and to go away and make an informed decision
4495575 the difficulty for preparation is the hardest thing we are only three weeks away from one of the biggest one day tournaments we play in yet we still dont know if we are going we have got a huge 12 months of cricket ahead of us but we will deal with that in a professional manner we have got a camp in brisbane in a weeks time to start our preparation
4495576 when you get opposition like port which does not allow you to play at your best and what was at stake and we still have a very young side if there is a w next to your name in round 20 you take it
4495577 any player who has seven centre clearances by half time you are in trouble we threw i suppose well three or four different type of combinations at him it was one of the best performances i had seen up to half time
4495578 i thought after half time we were able to rein it in he burgoyne had two in the third quarter and none in the last he either got sick of getting it the ball or we did something reasonably well i reckon it was a combination of both

4495583 we are confident that jackson browne will prevail in this lawsuit
4495584 not only have sen mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
4495585 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree
4495586 america has a choice its not between a stud and a dud this year

4495589 ironically there is eyewitness testimony of people having heard thallon himself claim that they acted under duress in signing and we have in writing written back at the time from a leading creation scientist and professor that thallon personally told him that ken ham had threatened to not buy the next issue of the magazine if they failed to sign so thallon is either telling the truth to this scientist or he is telling the truth in these hard to see how both can be the case

4495597 after that he will begin to work on the football side and the fitness side even more
4495598 we are prepared to do whatever it takes to win a football game in respect of a football game are we ready to kill someone to win a game no because you have to respect the rules in football the beauty in the game is to win in respect of the rules
4495599 can you win the league by playing completely non football i dont believe so historically it is proven that the teams who win the league are the better technical teams
4495600 the leading clubs have a responsibility to try to make the games attractive they can never be a long term target to play a dirty game or one which is not attractive we want to play our game because we feel it is the most efficient way to win
4495601 of course we have lost some players but we have also brought some players we opted for some stability
4495602 lets focus on the short term goals and lets show later on weve learned from when we dropped off last season
4495603 the plan is to play in the first game of the season i dont know my involvement because i wont have played pre season but thats the plan
4495604 i dont question that ive always had the desire thats the animal i am i cant question that
4495605 i said some time ago about practice its not a conscious choice any more its something i know that its part of my life and i will do it
4495606 the difficult one will be telling myself to give up certainly not wondering whether now is the time
4495607 maybe someone will have to come in there and decide for me
4495608 my shoulder is really good i dont know when it started feeling bad i think i was getting some pain pre world cup in the six nations 2003
4495609 my neck took control after that and ive not really played since so once i strung some games together there was obviously a problem
4495610 the shoulder problem has been there five years it was quite a long way gone so it was a great idea to get it done
4495611 when i was playing in some games i felt like i had no problem but in others i was waking up really struggling
4495612 it was tough to keep going so when there was an opportunity to get it done in the summer i took it
4495613 managing the team thats my job and if i felt at any time that was in jeopardy then that is when i would consider it leaving
4495614 weve got a ground to play in right now its a great stadium and when the supporters are behind us its a great place
4495615 we do need a new one but if we havent got it well still have a team so thats not really too big an issue for us at the moment
4495616 there have been some people commenting on the team spirit but its a load of nonsense
4495617 we are focused and with any change of manager there will always be different ideas that he brings to the table
4495618 but everyone is enjoying it everyone has a smile on their face and really looking forward to saturday
4495619 he is a player with experience of winning promotions from this division and played in the premier league last season
4495620 i saw many friendly games in pre season and if you say one team or two teams i think you are wrong
4495621 i saw a minimum of eight teams play very well for the champion ship im sure not only chelsea arsenal manchester and liverpool no forget that this season

4495627 i see jimmy in training every day and i see him working very hard at his game
4495628 i see him very focused and committed to the team so these things dont really tie up
4495629 i havent had any conversations with him since alistair macintosh made it clear that we dont want to be discussing at the moment new contracts for players who have at least two years left on their current ones
4495630 we would rather concentrate on improving our squad and seeing how that improvement pans out then maybe as the contracts go further into their term there will be time for readjustment
4495631 i dont really understand the arguments because if people are trying to suggest jimmy bullard is unhappy then that is not the case

4495651 this software will also help address the mobile industrys fragmentation issue by enabling developers to create a single interface that will work anywhere java is found
4495652 to further accelerate the adoption of the lwuit framework it is important to provide access to the source code under a liberal and well known open source license
4495653 this license choice provides the benefits of open source innovation and collaborative development while offering a risk free path to adoption by commercial products a model everybody should feel very comfortable with

4495655 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
4495656 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
4495657 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
4495658 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this

4495671 the cure is ms wrypunsters knitting were it not for her the show off ruffle skirt would have been buried in its own dumpiness we have considering put the proper sizes on models and avoiding unflattering angles but ms wrypunster works for free we are deeply grateful for her selflessness
4495672 i couldnt have done it without debbie bliss addison lace needle and katie himmelberg they are the real stars in this exciting event
4495673 katie himmelbergs summertime tunic was published in the summer 2007 issue of interweave knits as part of our simple knits series
4495674 actually its a delightful series the designs just need some tweaks to bring them to the high fashion standards weve come to expect from such a great magazine
4495675 changing the ribbing to a twisted 1 by 1 rib adding several inches of length and crocheting the straps rather than using ribbon all contribute to the success of this project ms wrypunster is thrilled
4495676 knitting size 33 1 2 was only possible with the help of my children us 3 and us 5

4495700 online reputation management covers such activities as pr seo and online monitoring there are also the offline monitoring and press clippings markets which are very closely related
4495701 aggregation tools such as addictomatic or yahoo pipes are great for marketers and pr professionals wanting to see a snapshot of their brand social media and ugc conversations they are good for providing trend data on topics or around key phrases brands and organisations
4495702 combining free tools from google technorati yahoo and other providers offers useful information but it is the analysis and interpretation of this data that is the valuable element and this takes time we are at the tipping point where for most large brands using free tools is no longer an option
4495703 reputations are increasingly going to be determined online whatever sector youre in so an analysis of what people are saying or thinking even about your own or a competitors brand is going to be an essential part of any future communications strategy

4495720 if one tortures a dataset long enough it will confess to anything
4495721 he who lives by the crystal ball soon learns to eat ground glass
4495722 to begin with you must distinguish between price and value
4495723 if you want to know the value of a security use the price of another security thats as similar to it as possible all the rest is modeling go and
4495724 the law of one price is not a law of nature its a general reflection on the practices of human beings who when they have enough time and enough information will grab a bargain when they see one
4495725 if you want to estimate the value of a target security the law of one price tells you to find some other replicating portfolio a collection of more liquid securities that collectively has the same future payouts as the target no matter how the future turns out it takes a model
4495726 but no mathematical model will capture the intricacies of human psychology if you listen to the models siren song for too long you may end up on the rocks or in the whirlpool
4495727 we really have to face the fact that mistakes are made in museums just as they are made anywhere else

4495730 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
4495731 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
4495732 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
4495733 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
4495734 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
4495735 its well documented that many people do not save enough for their retirement however if you are unfortunate enough to suffer a critical illness then you may never get your pension plan back on track
4495736 my staffs so appalled that im discussing this right now but would he be sneaking into the hotel in the middle of the night to see a child whos not his i dont think so
4495737 i mean you have to be so narcissistic and think so highly of yourself to think that we would be so stupid to believe that you would actually be going to a hotel just for no reason just in the middle of the night for no reason it makes no sense

4495747 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer were twofold
4495748 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4495749 in fact the good news for them is that the gap will now be shortened between half blood prince and the first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows

4495811 and where he saved his cruelest and most politically incorrect statement for the uber security minded openbsd developers
4495812 security people are often the black and white kind of people that i cant stand i think the openbsd crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys in that they make such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
4495813 as far as i am concerned openbsd is the project with the most demonstrated interest in fixing all bugs found no matter how trivial and to systematically examine all source code for instances of bugs encountered i believe that this is the bedrock principle of pursuing security software that just works rather than software with rube goldberg constructs of knobs and security theatre scenery
4495814 too often so called security is split into two camps one that believes in nondisclosure of problems by hiding knowledge until a bug is fixed and one that revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are torvalds states

4495825 the most important report youre likely to read this year
4495826 around the globe wind generating capacity has been expanding at a rapid 30 clip in recent years
4495827 its most promising division is the production of structural wind towers
4495828 led by states such as texas and california wind farms around the country will generate almost 50 billion kilowatt hours of electricity this year of course the u s is still playing catch up with many other regions
4495829 in fact countries such as spain portugal and denmark all rely on wind farms for as much as one quarter of their total power needs
4495830 across europe wind turbines will account for roughly one third of all new generating capacity installed over the next few years and could provide electricity for 90 million people by 2010
4495831 the outlook is even brighter in many booming energy hungry asian markets in china installed wind power capacity surged 130 last year and will reportedly supply a great deal of the electricity needed for the upcoming 2008 beijing olympic games
4495832 thanks to the great strides in engineering wind turbine output has increased by a factor of ten or higher in some cases over the past decade
4495833 the power generating potential of wind is enormous the wind resources in north dakota alone are enough to power a staggering one third of the countrys total power needs
4495834 it comes as no surprise to hear that 36 billion will be spent on wind generating equipment this year i see trinity as a great way to participate
4495835 trinity is a top supplier of several different industrial product lines including railroad cars highway girders inland cargo barges and propane tanks all of which happen to be doing pretty well at the moment
4495836 however the firm has a large and growing stake in wind towers the company is among a handful of recognized leaders in the market for these giant tubes
4495837 this facet of the firms business is growing rapidly amid heated demand wind tower revenues have spiked 35 fold over the past four years soaring from just 11 million in 2004 to an expected 390 million this year
4495838 better still order backlog over the past 12 months has surged from 200 million to 1 6 billion representing a highly visible stream of future business within the next five years management is forecasting that wind tower revenues could double again to 800 million
4495839 even without energy equipment the firms other business segments alone merit a closer look
4495840 the firms fleet of 41 000 railroad cars available for lease is 99 6 utilized and the average lease has over five years remaining
4495841 these revenues are locked in and will provide some stability regardless of what happen on the product sales side but future orders should remain robust considering 700 000 of the nations 1 6 million railcars are more than 25 years old and the replacement cycle has already begun

4495862 here may be the clearest manifestation of osds contempt for the accumulated wisdom of the military profession and of the assumption among forward thinkers that technology above all information technology has rendered obsolete the conventions traditionall governing the preparation and conduct of war

4496020 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4496021 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
4496022 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4496023 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4496024 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4496025 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4496026 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4496027 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4496028 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4496029 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4496030 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4496031 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4496032 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4496033 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4496034 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4496035 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4496036 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4496037 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
4496038 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4496039 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw

4496080 its quite mind blowing to not only access such a wide audience but to be in direct contact with the people who watch your film i also love that viewers are from all over the world every filmmaker spends incredible amounts of time and effort in making what they do but short films are still to date mostly considered show reel material and practice for a longer format an opportunity to screen outside of the film festival circuit is very refreshing and rewarding

4496082 i have a lot of friends and family back at home there im pretty excited obviously i want to move up the levels but its definitely a great place to play im excited to be a part of the organization and i cant wait to play in front of my friends and family it should be a good time
4496083 we had a mite team that actually had a lot of good guys
4496084 i think nine out of the 13 or 14 guys played division i we traveled every weekend to get good competition we just kept playing and developing our skills it kind of got to a point where you made it to juniors or college and then youre playing professional its just sticking with it and working hard it comes from having good parents and good people around you
4496085 i went to south carolina and they had a lot of nhl and ahl guys signed
4496086 i had been asking for a trade for a couple of weeks i finally got traded to a good spot where i could at least help a team try to win a few games and put some points up i definitely saw the business side of it last year everybodys trying to make the team better and sometimes youve got to do whats best for yourself
4496087 i was very fortunate he was hardly getting any ice time in charleston
4496088 he was one of the guys i was able to make a deal for and i was certainly glad i did hes a great kid just a great young man you couldnt ask for a harder working team player
4496089 hes fast as lightning hes just a marvelous kid i really think hes going to get a shot in the american hockey league i would expect he wont be in phoenix too long especially if he picks up where he left off
4496090 i have a lot of friends and family back at home there im pretty excited obviously i want to move up the levels but its definitely a great place to play im excited to be a part of the organization and i cant wait to play in front of my friends and family it should be a good time
4496091 phoenix was definitely up there on the list obviously because im from there they put together a good deal for me there were a couple of other teams i was interested in but phoenix was the best spot i wound up being home
4496092 im going to go and try to do well up there and get a good look
4496093 hopefully they take a good look at me if im down in phoenix my job is just to put points up and help the team win i just need to keep working hard
4496094 i think that my size and my past numbers arent that great so i think on paper its discouraging for some scouts and organizations
4496095 every summer i work as hard as i can to prove myself as long as im getting better every year i know that my time will come but i definitely was disappointed i thought id get a couple of cracks
4496096 all the teams in the echl now have affiliations so theyre going to lean towards their own contracted players first
4496097 theres guys in the nhl and in the american league who are certainly smaller than him i think it was he hadnt proved himself yet and maybe hadnt been seen enough now if he starts throwing some numbers up in a hurry with that speed somebodys got to recognize it and give him a shot hes one of the fastest skaters ive ever coached

4496105 were proceeding under the assumption that were not going to be able to get myhtos or proceed on it
4496106 because of the nature of how the ip is being held and the technology being held separately it seems safer and better for us to proceed as if were really not going to have any avenue to work with it
4496107 we were in very advanced negotiations with a couple of people for deals that would have kept flagship open and would have kept everything running
4496108 and in fact for a good while it was looking like a near certainty that one of those would have come to fruition
4496109 to the last minute and actually beyond the last minute i know that negotiations were going on to try and make sure that we could get the studio back on track
4496110 primarily we just all proceeded here like we were going to be releasing our open beta in october and kept working until the last minute

4496149 first there was skkull then there was the drone drug continuing on the same path the sound of the drone drug is of a similar relentless minimalistic nature as its predesessor this could be seen as the electronic backbone to last years amazing blood spirits amp drums are singing conspiracy records creating a heavy beast with the most basic and stripped down use of variations in drones and frequencies instead of guitars and percussion monotonous motor humming via drugged out machinery and assaults of feedback attacking with a strong feel of claustrophobia compared to skkull the drone drug evolves more around a grim and abrasive sound constantly toying with lo fi aesthetics and a rough industrial edge the atmosphere created is thick and black bringing up visions of a dystopian society trembling on the edge of the world spreading the disease in a world slowly dying the drone drug is poison and affect you it will on this recording the skull defekts is joachim nordwall and henrik rylander 4 tracks cut by an unsharpened razor total playtime of 52 minutes 4 panel digipack with artwork by daniel fagerstr m

4496207 but it has nothing to do with religion it has everything to do with inconsistencies in positions hes held
4496208 one thing quickly became apparent residents want a vibrant lasalle square with a variety of uses
4496209 synergy between public opinion and market realities indicates that lasalle square will be a mixed use center
4496210 the lasalle square neighborhood shows a market need for most types of stores but these needs are more than met by stores in a wider area primarily by large stores on north bendix
4496211 the neighborhood within a one mile radius of lasalle square could support a modest amount of convenience retail development on the northeast corner of the complex
4496212 for lasalle square to meet its potential the neighborhood around it must improve by upgrading existing housing and residential streets and adding housing increasing local employment especially in the industrial and logistics sectors improving the educational attainment of neighborhood students and workers
4496213 lasalle square must also be redesigned as an attractive space with limited retail use and additional recreational institutional or other public use
4496214 an institutional use of the site or a portion of the site would be a good way to generate traffic to from the square to support retail
4496215 ultimately implementation of the final plan will need committed citizens like the residents organizing the farmers market and dynamic community partnerships to succeed
4496216 this isnt a technical plan for bureaucrats to follow and implement it is a plan for the neighborhood and community as a whole to follow and implement in order to bring their vision to reality
4496217 if the city chose not to make these investments in lasalle square we wouldnt save a single police officer or firefighter or prevent the closure of a single park facility or recreation program
4496218 by state law these dollars can only be used for economic development in the same way that individuals cannot use a retirement plan to pay for rising gas and food prices just as families use certain funds for their future the city is making strategic investments to improve economic conditions and raise property values in the inner city
4496219 a nice slap in the big fat face of the fundies
4496220 if at first it seems so complicated that the evolutionary steps are hard to work out
4496221 last season we had a staggered start tevez and anderson joined us and werent 100 per cent fit ronaldo got suspended for three games after the first game then rooney got injured in the first match against reading and was out for three games
4496222 by the time we got everyone focused and fit we then went on a fantastic run with our consistency and really good football
4496223 id prefer to get a good start we want that but we are also able to go the long distance
4496224 in terms of attacking options we are down to the bare bones a bit
4496225 but the backbone is with the midfield players and defenders and there is good variety there
4496226 hopefully that is enough to get us through the first game against newcastle which is always a good exciting game they will always have a go newcastle
4496227 its no good trying to kid people he just needs a week in with the group doing all the things he needs to do
4496228 it would be crazy on our part to try and short cut it because its michael owen we treat him the same as any player
4496229 we need to start well and get off to a flyer and just keep winning
4496230 man united have a few tough games early on we need to focus we have a good home record and if we can continue that and get off to a good start well be all right
4496231 hes probably one of the best ive ever trained with or played against
4496232 he looks awesome he has a great touch opens up defences and can pass the ball he gets stuck in as well which i like about him
4496233 he makes it look so easy and is a class act when you see him day in day out you realize how determined he is
4496234 unfortunately they did not perform in the way we needed last night
4496235 but we will see an improvement at the weekend we need to step up to the plate and become more dynamic it is important we show a bit more quality on the ball with the right pass at the right time
4496236 we hope that this new field research the first definitive crash causation study to be done in the united states in almost 30 years will shed new light on the causes of crashes on our nations highways knowledge gained from this study may help all of us concerned with rider safety to develop even more effective countermeasures to enhance the safety of motorcyclists everywhere but we wont know until the study which will be a long and thorough process has been conducted for the safety of motorcyclists we need this federal study to be of high priority and move forward as soon as possible
4496237 the overwhelming number of motorcyclists who wind up in single vehicle crash statistics are there because they arent following basic but important safety precautions when riding
4496238 and fewer than half of all riders have taken any kind of formal training course we also know that car drivers and other motorists are at fault a majority of the time in multiple vehicle crashes that involve a motorcyclist we have life saving messages for everyone whether they are behind the handlebars or behind a steering wheel
4496239 all of these are all doable real world actions that will cut down crashes and fatalities right now
4496240 above everything else its about the human element the attitude the mind set that motorcyclists and motorists have and the choices they make out there on the road
4496241 the new tc 250 is very thin and compact offering superior handling and responsiveness
4496242 provide rider training and support for motorcycle safety and awareness programs
4496243 they used to call this bike a blue rubber cow because of how it would wobble in the corners
4496244 the first thing we did was gusset the frame to make it a much smoother and more stable ride
4496245 obviously as a motorcycle insurance company we hold rider safety in the highest regard
4496246 it is a perfect fit for markel american to partner with an organization as focused on rider safety as is the bmw moa foundation
4496247 this event has turned into one of the highlights of my year
4496248 i cant think of a better way to spend an october day in nashville than riding motorcycles in the afternoon and playing guitars and singing with some buddies at sundown everyone has been so supportive and im really proud of the money weve been able to raise for vanderbilt over the last few years

4496250 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4496251 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4496252 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4496253 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince
4496254 i like mccain but obama is pretty good too im just not sure
4496255 but one of the things we have are some built in controls that will auto adjust your orders based on fills that are coming in
4496256 so even if you deploy globally theres a centralized permissioning interface that potentially will allow you to specify which users can see or even have access to various accounts to trade particular stocks
4496257 to have access to different liquidity points to different trading venues
4496258 we got information that some people were coming with leopard skins the people were arrested on the shimla bypass and the leopard skins were recovered from them these are all skins of leopards killed in the past one and a half to two months
4496259 they lured me and i got carried away they said they would pay me two three thousand rupees this is the first mistake of my life i never did anything like this before i dont kill animals
4496260 when i was a kid i always wanted to become a journalist and i am very sympathetic towards journalists there is a passion and a drive in you people to deliver truth to the general public and that too as fast as possible because your work is very competitive in todays scenario when you switch on the television there are hundreds of television channels and new crop up every day
4496261 if you talk about terrorism we are all victims of terrorism and this film is based on the train blasts which happened in mumbai in july 11 2006 i was in pondicherry at that time and i think all of us remember where we were at that particular time some of us were directly affected by the bomb blasts while some of us were indirectly i think that all of us are reminded of that fact that whenever incidents like this happens we call the people who are near and dear to us who might have been affected as we want to know what might have happened to them then we think that this could have happened to us or somebody close to us so we are all victims of terrorism
4496262 rakhi is a beautiful festival when i can pray for the longlife safety and wellbeing of my brother
4496263 i love my brother a lot and would like to take simple and intricately designed rakhis for my brother
4496264 fifty percent of those men say they struggle with pornography online
4496265 i saw another survey that included christian pastors and one third of those pastors said theyre addicted to pornography online
4496266 we were getting more and more calls of families destroyed marriages destroyed men losing their jobs
4496267 and it just became obvious that there was a crisis
4496268 the problem of pornography is not just one group of men
4496269 i mean it goes past pastors the guy next door your neighbor your brother in law all of us are vulnerable
4496270 i can introduce you to a man who was a pillar in the christian community who confessed to a ten year double lifestyle of porn addiction and sex addiction
4496271 and he only got caught when he got so sick with chlymadia that he brought it home to his wife he was the leader of a childrens ministry
4496272 youre saying i want to be healthier going to the lord for the strength and for the healing is the only key you have
4496273 i really believe that a man cannot overcome this by himself
4496274 they call that white knuckling i can hold on i havent looked at it for three months and what every guy will tell you is its cyclical
4496275 pretty soon you discover that you really do have a transformed mind it is a renewed heart
4496276 and its because you implanted the truth of god while also eliminating some of the things of this world that get us in trouble
4496277 there are chemical and physical processes happening in your body everyday that are perpetuating this problem
4496278 it doesnt matter if youre a male or female the processes are the same so you have to learn how to interrupt those processes in order for true change to take place
4496279 once you have that in your heart you better be on guard the rest of your life
4496280 its really time for the church to pull its head out of the sand and begin to deal with these issues openly and honestly
4496281 we as the church need the recovery groups that are out there now
4496282 there are materials men meeting with other men saying hey how you coming on your walk theres also the power of prayer is the church praying for this
4496283 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
4496284 a society without religion is like a ship without a compass
4496285 the bible is no mere book but a living creature with a power that conquers all that oppose it
4496286 the person who says well im going to put my faith on the shelf and not let it affect my decisions as president is either lying or theyre ignorant
4496287 im going to ask them about abortion i am going to ask them about the definition of marriage
4496288 i intend to ask the tough questions but i am going to ask them in a civil way
4496289 im certainly going to ask a question about jesus christ in this forum
4496290 theyre going to come out take a picture together thats the picture everybody wants
4496291 every one of those 40 million children are in heaven now the people who had those abortions are not guaranteed heaven now where would you have an evangelist spend most of his time winning the people to christ who need forgiveness or worrying about all those children who are in heaven because they are safe
4496292 we have to go back to what evangelicals have been for 2 000 years
4496293 i want to raise the personal responsibility in peoples lives
4496294 i want to raise that level of civility in our society and i want to raise the level of credibility in the church that the church is not known simply for what were against
4496295 god said yeah all this stuff youre doing is good
4496296 the bible tells us that jesus christ went into every village preaching teaching and healing one third of jesus ministry was health care he cared about the sick he was a healer
4496297 cause thats where the church needs to be in the heart of darkness we need to be holding up the light of christ holding up the cross where everybody else is afraid to go
4496298 the problem is we dont have the right to demonize people just because we disagree with them we dont have a right to destroy their character or reputation just because we disagree
4496299 im not a religious left because i dont believe in big government im not secular left im not religious right and im not secular right
4496300 i happen to be in the kingdom of god my kingdom is not of this world
4496301 we are members of the body of christ christ shed his blood for us were going to live in heaven together
4496302 and yet if you dont hold the party line all of a sudden for these people politics trumps faith and sometimes when people dont understand that they want you to be on their political bandwagon
4496303 you cannot change lives simply through laws thats what the book of galatians teaches so i dont have that much faith in politics
4496304 politicians come and go no matter who gets elected in four or eight years theyll be out
4496305 neither of these men are the next savior of the world theyre both flawed individuals and theyre both going to need god
4496306 obviously knew what he was doing he was experienced senator obama was getting some very nice waves he was handling himself well
4496307 we have to do what we can to reassure other nations in the region that we will try to assist them in maintaining their independence
4496308 recognize that this action by russia against georgia may not be isolated
4496309 i am interested in good relations between the united states and russia
4496310 but in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations
4496311 after the events of the past six days no one should wonder why countries on russias periphery so ardently seek the security guarantees alliance membership represents
4496312 apparently conflicting with the essence of olympism and wada calls for

4496331 as a testament to the struggles of those who have gone before as a legacy for those who will come after as a tribute to the endurance the patience the courage of our forefathers and mothers as an assurance that their prayers are being answered that their work has not been in vain and that hope is eternal tomorrow night my name will go into nomination for the presidency of the united states of america

4496333 the only time that we win is when we come together in 1960 john kennedy the late john kennedy beat richard nixon by only 112 000 votes less than one vote per precinct he won by the margin of our hope he brought us together he reached out
4496334 in 1964 lyndon johnson brought both wings together the thesis the antithesis and the creative synthesis and together we won in 1976 jimmy carter unified us again and we won when do we not come together we never win in 1968 the division and despair in july led to our defeat in november in 1980 rancor in the spring and the summer led to reagan in the fall when we divide we cannot win we must find common ground as the basis for survival and development and change and growth
4496335 our ships could pass in the night if we have a false sense of independence or they could collide and crash
4496336 as jesus said not my will but thine be done it was his way of saying theres a higher good beyond personal comfort or position

4496355 it is my absolute pleasure to stand alongside the staff of sunset community health center inc and pfizer two organizations that have successfully joined forces in a public private partnership to produce a healthier safer and more productive arizona
4496356 due to rising health insurance premiums and an increasing number of employers dropping health benefits more and more of our colleagues friends and neighbors are turning to community health services for care
4496357 since our partnership began more than a decade ago pfizer has proven to be a committed ally in our efforts to make better health an attainable goal for yumas residents who through no fault of their own may not otherwise get the care they need when they need it
4496358 pfizer is dedicated to supporting community service organizations that improve access to quality health care we are fortunate to have partners in this mission like sunset community health center a fixture of yumas health care community and congressman raul grijalva who has persisted in his efforts to improve the health of the citizens of arizona

4496386 an official english language resolution is often treated a lot like a we love the spotted owl resolution
4496387 its there but it has no power because its not enforced
4496388 i guess in some respects he could try to put a very restrictive interpretation on it and not apply it anymore often than he has to
4496389 to me these cards represent thousands of voices crying out to be heard on this issue
4496390 the citizens are not going to be held hostage by the threat of lawsuits
4496391 as we look to grow existing business and to attract new business this affects our ability to do that
4496392 i know this has been said before but this is not who we are
4496393 there is a pretty strong divide as i am sure there is in the democratic party on this
4496394 so it is probably going to be difficult for us to take a position as a party
4496395 i thought for a first scrimmage it was pretty clean as far as being penalty free
4496396 we had a couple alignment situations but for the most part i thought the first day handling the clock and all that type of thing game situations i was impressed by how that happened
4496397 still need to get a lot better in certain situations so well continue to work with those situations for the most part i thought the kids were organized and did a good job

4496405 but i thought he moved pretty well and ran pretty hard
4496406 if i was sleeping it would have woke me up
4496407 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4496408 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4496409 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4496410 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4496440 it seems like a lot of music today is so churned out and simple i like playing these festivals because its one thing all day and then here i come on and everyones like whoa then back to the grind
4496441 it sounds like a banjo but they sing with it and its the most fucking passionate emotional music ive ever heard in my life
4496442 i want to include that in my album because its so passionate like when you hear a korn song and its really going crazy these guys do it with a stringy banjo i want to bring that to kids here who are like what the fuck is this and open their minds up to something different
4496443 its no secret that i had my problems during my last few years in korn
4496444 there were drug issues and i just wasnt enjoying the music any more thats why im so excited about this album i poured everything i had into it and i think ive really connected with the fans which was one of the primary purposes for doing it hopefully it will inspire those who hear it i hope they feel the magic again the same kind of feeling that i now have
4496445 its great that everyone agreed that flush should be the albums first single
4496446 it talks about flushing the bad things out of your life and trying to get a fresh start thats the story of my life over the last few years as i look back on everything i went through in korn all the drugs and alcohol i guess the bottom line is that im glad im not dead i apparently survived all of that for a reason and hopefully im fulfilling some of that now

4496448 heres a song yall all know if you dont fucking know this song youre not a korn fan
4496449 parks amp recreation is committed to controlling the spread of dutch elm disease ded in riverside park and elsewhere throughout the city
4496450 thanks to funding from the greenacre foundation and the riverside park fund we are able to work with almstead tree co to take proactive measures to remove infected trees and inoculate our healthy trees in the fight against ded
4496451 these are big shade trees that do well in compacted urban soil which is why you find so many of them in city parks
4496452 we are delighted to be working with the parks department on trying to save these wonderful trees throughout manhattan
4496453 dutch elm disease shuts down a trees vascular system similar to a heart attack in a human
4496454 we all talk to people who talk to people and there are people close to the obama campaign in the course of conversations who made clear to me that there was very high level discussions the obama people expect powell to endorse him
4496455 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
4496456 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
4496457 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
4496458 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
4496459 he didnt abandon the minister that brought him closer to his faith but at the same time he deplored the kinds of statements that the reverend wright had made
4496460 the obama people are quietly trying to line up a pretty strong convention
4496461 i think the obama campaign shouldnt be underestimated obviously anyone would like to have powells endorsement
4496462 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4496463 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4496464 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4496465 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4496466 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4496467 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4496468 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4496469 tennis as a sport is fully committed to the fight against doping

4496476 make sure you fit the windows properly to avoid gaps and use the most insulating materials available
4496477 make sure your buildings are structurally sound and well insulated insulation helps keep buildings warm in winter and cool in summer and so reduces the energy requirement for heating and ventilation
4496478 where fans and heaters are installed in the same building interlocked controls should be used to stop the heating when the fans are running above their minimum ventilation setting
4496479 operating ventilation at 4 of maximum output rather than 2 increases average heating costs by 7p a bird
4496480 look hard at where the markets heading and how far ahead you want to be buying for the markets are high and this certainly isnt the year to buy five years of energy
4496481 we are expecting fairly hefty increases in the next four to six months
4496482 it is worth addressing this a few months ahead or you could be tied in for a further 12 months at a new standard rate
4496483 today is a day of pride and it will be written with golden letters in the history of the nation

4496487 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4496488 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4496489 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4496490 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well

4496495 we have to manage him so his head isnt turned we will give danny an education here and if he listens and learns then he could be very good player and then he could name his own price
4496496 none of us would be surprised if danny went to a premier league club he has got electrifying pace but what were trying to do is give him a football perspective
4496497 he has played a lot of games for me now and he has matured he is a terrific lad who is finding his voice in the changing room and it would take really good money to prise him away from here
4496498 language is thinking thinking is language the rest is silence
4496499 back breaker is the sum of our bands raw power aggression and total dedication to heavy metal its all about our band getting what we do live on tape back breaker is the record the showdown made when we stopped caring about anything but heavy metal if a riff is heavy you dont have to over think it just let it crush you we are 100 dedicated to heavy metal and pushing ourselves to playing it as loud and rude as possible

4496501 f k it well do it live will come out in the states through hot topic interpunk com and the usual digital haunts in late october we are in negotiations to have it released overseas in time for the halloween run as well
4496502 i have recently heard the rough mixes of the audio and love the way its turning out its been hard touring working on this project and getting ready for some other projects but we have a great group of people from the allentown pa area who are kicking ass mixing editing and doing everything they can to help and that is part of the reason we did the recording there thank you to the promoter frank phobia and his crew for helping out with the recording and now taking on all the additional work
4496503 this is like my favorite lineup that ive ever had and ive definitely had members come and go for many different reasons over the years and not all have
4496504 it kind of sucks because every time you get a different band member its way beyond crazy a lot of the guys that ive played with are guys that are front men of their own bands and they want to break up which has been i would say 90 of the cases with most of the guys i play with who no longer play with me anymore to do their own thing
4496505 if you see this there was a major bug while creating object dimension
4496506 the demand for schlitz brown bottles has outpaced production and sales have outperformed projections by as much as 100 in milwaukee minneapolis and chicago in milwaukee several stores sold out the same day the first shipment was delivered with one store selling nearly 80 cases in an afternoon some stores were forced to resort to extensive waiting lists once the first shipment sold out as customers were traveling from across the state to get their hands on the classic formula and bottle
4496507 the tap is part of the grand baroque collection an iconic symbol of schlitz the grand baroque collection was the most ornate and highest quality point of sale materials ever released by the brewery
4496508 i didnt think i did anything out of the ordinary to earn the award
4496509 ive been involved with the youth league for about six years we are always in need of funds so i thought donating the money would be the right thing to do every penny we have helps a lot of local kids i didnt have that kind of support growing up so any kid we can help makes me feel better

4496528 canadians depend on our artists and their work to communicate canadian values government investment is a crucial element of cultural diplomacy in every developed nation including canada
4496529 whats being considered is to examine how we can create a new program or new avenues that will be more efficient and with a stronger impact for our culture abroad
4496530 that we seek efficiency i think the first beneficiary of this action will be the cultural world
4496531 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
4496532 we got information that some people were coming with leopard skins the people were arrested on the shimla bypass and the leopard skins were recovered from them these are all skins of leopards killed in the past one and a half to two months
4496533 they lured me and i got carried away they said they would pay me two three thousand rupees this is the first mistake of my life i never did anything like this before i dont kill animals
4496534 plot plot plot plot plot plot plot plot yeah yeah your plot made sense but i wasnt interested in it i was not interested in any of these characters your plot hung together but there was no real story
4496535 yeah thatll be good lets have some three eyed cowboys ive got no idea what theyre going to do in the story but this issues all about three eyed cowboys i mean you might think of a story thats got three eyed cowboys in it and hope it comes to some sort of resolution but it always does
4496536 people will laugh at me cos im doing superhero comics id better make em really clever then no one will laugh
4496537 what does this suggest if this is the name what do they look like
4496538 so peter pan he teaches wendy how to fly theres the island of the lost boys i could see that that would have had a lot of sexual shadows to it but i never really thought of what i could do with it other than
4496539 alright what if wendy from peter pan is one of the characters
4496540 1913 that was when the war was kicking off and there was that stravinsky performance in paris of
4496541 theres something epic about this theres something really stark about sexuality and war because most of the people who get sent to die in wars are young men whove got a lot of energy and would probably rather in a better world be putting that energy into copulation rather than going over there and blowing some other young mans guts out
4496542 yeah we shot our missiles right up their back door
4496543 they might be just made out of words and paper but their effect in the world can be massive
4496544 hang on superman isnt real what do we mean superman wouldnt do that
4496545 oh there should be a word that means this or that could it be this could it be
4496546 now where does that word come from what does it actually mean
4496547 songs are floating in the air and its my duty to grab them before some cunt like paul simon does
4496548 ideas are like pumpkins they just float through the air and hit people on the head
4496549 right theres a hut we havent got a word for it yet but hut
4496550 hang on i did this yesterday and that the day before and that the day before
4496551 wait a minute did that happen or did that happen in my story
4496552 right whats just happened to you is that you have for the first time confused your real life with your fiction dont worry about this this is going to happen quite a lot its just important that you remember that youre a real person this is your name that other stuff was stuff that you wrote keep the line there
4496553 i didnt dream that that must be real the annalidden ancestor
4496554 look up how many words do begin with n theres not many i could probably get through that in half an hour
4496555 ok so 6 panels 35 words a panel that means about 210 words per page maximum
4496556 alright ill have one of them say its getting cold shall we be getting back
4496557 right theyre right down by the tide line there and actually it would take them quite a long while to walk back up the beach and i dont just wanna suddenly jump to them on the seafront and i dont wanna caption saying meanwhile shortly later
4496558 thats charming theres something lovely about that wouldnt it be great if you could have a moving element that was moving between the panels
4496559 yeah i can see his problem here as soon as you get to the right hand side of the top row then the actions gotta suddenly go to the middle left hand side
4496560 if only i could do what hed done but make it a bit cleverer and have moving elements in
4496561 do you look at the pictures first or do you read the words
4496562 the entire universe for one thing only exists in your perceptions
4496563 this idea doesnt work because of this this and this this idea could work if we did this this and this
4496564 does it satisfy the plot demands of the lowest level of audience comprehension
4496565 people putting up fallout shelter notices thats kind of ominous that sets a tone
4496566 actually that kind of looks a little bit like a very stylised picture of a black ship so maybe if i wrote a caption from the pirate comic that the little boy is reading that would reinforce the readers identification with this black and yellow shape as being a black ship seen against a yellow sky and then ill also have some balloon from the off panel news vendor that will have some resonance with the content of this pirate caption which is mainly about war piracy death
4496567 time is a multi faceted construct that human beings insist on viewing one surface at a time
4496568 and yes dr manhattans view of the world is the right one
4496569 what is this what would i think if this happened what would i do if this happened
4496570 what would a mass vegetable consciousness be like what would the concerns of a vegetable consciousness be what would its emotional range be
4496571 someone expended all this effort and created all this beauty on this story
4496572 this colour work this soft crayon work its beautiful it looks like childrens illustrations so therefore it looks fake
4496573 is there anything interesting visually we can do with this spread
4496574 what sort of music can i put to this capering this dancing thatll make sense of it and will bring out its best qualities
4496575 right next issue of the fantastic four like what if theres some really big powerful threat from space sort of or according to some people what if in the next issue the ff the fantastic four fight god
4496576 galactus galactus eats planets and hes got this herald and its this silver guy on a surfboard and he goes before him and this guys so frightening that solar systems will switch off their suns so that he doesnt notice them theyll black out their entire galaxies so that hell pass them by and yeah the watcher he intervenes and fills the earths sky with illusions to keep this creature away but it doesnt work
4496577 yeah and he fights a cockroach kind of guy in this issue now go away and draw me the story
4496578 yeah alright first page five panels in the first panel this happens and this happens do you understand
4496579 some of the things that i put my readers through are pretty extreme
4496580 look despite the fact that theres all this previous detail if youve got a better way of doing this panel then as long as you basically understand the effect i was going for here and can think of a better way to achieve it then please do im counting on you if youve got a better idea than me to throw it in because thatll make the story better
4496581 id say to anyone aspiring to be a writer write what you like
4496582 god i wish i was as brilliant as him and im glad im not as penniless as him
4496583 jesus how does she do this stuff these sentences are fucking fantastic the way they sort of self destruct
4496584 yes our ways our vanities our funny little intrigues this is the stuff of legend the only stuff of legend for gods sake dont write anything in genre dont write detective stories because theyre low and vulgar
4496585 what would be really impossible to do or nearly impossible to do what am i not sure i could do
4496586 for fucks sake help me find a way out of this novel before i go mad give me an ending
4496587 im going to have written the great british novel by the time im
4496588 unreason is now ascendant in the united states in our schools in our courts and in each branch of the federal government only 28 percent of americans believe in evolution 68 percent believe in satan ignorance in this degree concentrated in both the head and belly of a lumbering superpower is now a problem for the entire world
4496589 a letter to a u k newspaper says science provides an explanation of the mechanism of the december 2004 asian tsunami but it cannot say why this occurred any more than religion can there in one sentence we have the religious mind displayed before us in all its absurdity in what sense of the word why does plate tectonics not provide the answer not only does science know why the tsunami happened it can give precious hours of warning if a small fraction of the tax breaks handed out to churches mosques and synagogues had been diverted into an early warning system tens of thousands of people now dead would have been moved to safety lets get up off our knees stop cringing before bogeymen and virtual fathers face reality and help science to do something constructive about human suffering
4496590 the fool doth think he is wise but the wise man knows himself to be a fool
4496591 there has been around 2 000 people at the open day including one gcse student who wanted to be well prepared
4496592 we made 200 offers yesterday and handled 400 calls to the hotline and everyone thats called us has spoken to a real person that contact helps people who can be quite anxious
4496593 weve seen an increase in people interested in studying applied sciences which is great and fits with the national picture
4496594 the gap between future us receipts and future government obligations now totals 66 trillion dollars a sum impossible for the us to reconcile which means the us is now technically bankrupt
4496595 we hope to bring the rest of our facilities back online overnight and be shipping from all of our distribution centers on friday but the issues weve faced over the last several days have been significant and theres no guarantee at this point that our shipping operations will be fully restored by tomorrow
4496596 although as youve probably read our organization american media is under the gun they have nevertheless devoted really big money to this
4496597 the enormous amounts we know edwards is spending to keep it contained but he cant weve followed the money trail he bought her
4496598 we have exclusive photographic evidence pictures videos hard proof to further incriminate edwards he doesnt at this point know what we have which is why im asking that we dont reveal too much yet and which we will use unless and until he acknowledges paternity
4496599 for now shes following whatever script hes written for her shes saying what shes told to say keeping her mouth shut john edwards and rielle are in steady contact who knows but as things go along she may tire of the game and well be ready
4496600 were in this for the long haul were sitting on very exclusive material like a reporter monitoring a room they were in from 9 45 p m to 2 45 a m we had the big
4496601 i saw a ball of flame and people flying in the air
4496602 a minute later people told me that i was bleeding from my back the police transferred me to iskandariyah hospital
4496603 the army will replace the police in iskandariyah after this security violation
4496604 the police are not capable to deal with the suicide attacks they dont have detectors and the necessary equipment for these kind of attacks
4496605 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4496606 the fig has received confirmation from the international olympic committee that all passports are valid for all gymnasts competing in the beijing olympic games

4496611 usually its very difficult for lay people to get an idea of what a facility is like just by looking at a bunch of statistics
4496612 she is in great form and things didnt quite go her way on her last run
4496613 she had to make the running and the race wasnt run to suit so we are hoping for better this weekend
4496614 christophe has an agreement to ride the niarchos family horses so he will be on board arcadias angle in the race
4496615 yutaka is an excellent jokey and i am sure he will do a good job
4496616 tamayuz has been very well since winning at chantilly last time in fact he couldnt be better
4496617 he was very impressive in the prix jean prat and my only worry is that the ground at deauville is going to be on the soft side

4496623 after what has happened ossetians and abkhaz will scarcely be able to live in one state with the georgians
4496624 to say that i found some of russias actions disproportionate and in particular think the presence of russian troops in georgia proper is not sensible russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia
4496625 the basic point for a political solution must be georgias territorial integrity
4496626 we agreed with french president sarkozys main principles for resolving the conflict these principles must be accepted by the georgian side
4496627 georgia and ukraine could be members of nato we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains
4496628 restore peace and to ensure that nobody again has such idiotic ideas
4496629 we have the impression that saakashvili is opposed to the diplomacy of the past 15 years
4496630 we dont want a long or short term warming of relations with the european union with the united states or with other countries
4496631 we are ready to work with everyone openly and in good faith and we do not want to curtail our relations with any parties
4496632 we are of course not against international peacekeepers but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except for russian peacekeepers
4496633 women and children were murdered churches packed with refugees set alight and entire villages razed

4496635 basically we lead the salmon into a vat we call the dream machine and kill them by running a low grade electric current through the water
4496636 boil salmon steaks with seal oil using a hot rock use the left over liquid to prepare a soup of salmon eggs and seaweed

4496861 look at chase stanley the best game hes played this year was when wendell sailor was outside him
4496862 thats what he does for people he brings enthusiam to the place he makes them believe
4496863 i didnt want to see him not do himself justice
4496864 hes been a strong player hes been a great player i was glad he showed he could play nrl again
4496865 does not require us to sacrifice our own security and welfare to the convenience or advantage of others self preservation is the first principle of our nature when our lives and properties are at stake it would be foolish and unnatural to refrain from such measures as might preserve them because it would be detrimental to others
4496866 tell me not of the british commons lords and ministerial tools i scorn to let my life depend upon the pleasure of any of them
4496867 after one can it seemed to turn the young individual into one with more of the type of profile you would expect to see with someone with cardiovascular disease
4496868 people who already have existing cardiovascular disease may want to talk to their physician before they drink red bull in future
4496869 maybe theres something quirky about the effect of the combination of the two in the drink which is causing this reaction this is what we need to look at next
4496870 the study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee therefore the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range
4496871 another health scare and tomorrows will be aubergines advocaat avocados frank upton solihull
4496872 we see it all the time this group is up from pioneer square
4496873 terrorism cannot be checked merely by addressing the nation from the red fort the manmohan singh government should issue a white paper besides convening an all party meeting to find a solution to the menace
4496874 the present situation calls for strict measures and a will to follow them to check the terror that has claimed over 600 lives in 17 major strikes in the four years of upa rule
4496875 i was busy with my schedule and could not make it for the party we have not boycotted it
4496876 we happily congratulate dahal for being elected the prime minister of the republic of nepal this had to happen four months ago when the maoist emerged as the single largest party
4496877 we appeal to all parties including the nepali congress which together fought for establishment of the republic to cooperate in order to consolidate this process by adopting a properly deliberated republican constitution
4496878 in their struggle for a better future with a more representative and inclusive republican polity
4496879 i came to sri lanka with a lot of expectations i would like to better my previous performance i am happy with the way i have started in the rights spirit i am feeling very confident after the warm up match today
4496880 the two have been bowling very well i have seen them in the test series they have been outstanding earlier murali was only one guy but now they also have mendis so we have to play outstanding cricket to deal with the situation
4496881 obviously i have to face a better attack when i play the odi but today my innings was against an international side with mendis and muralitharan sri lanka will have a potent attack
4496882 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4496883 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4496884 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4496885 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4496886 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4496887 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4496888 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4496889 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4496890 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4496891 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4496892 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4496893 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4496894 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4496895 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4496896 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4496897 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4496898 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4496899 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4496900 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4496901 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4496902 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4496903 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4496904 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4496905 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4496906 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4496907 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4496908 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4496909 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4496910 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4496911 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4496912 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4496913 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4496914 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4496915 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4496916 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4496917 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4496918 on a limpression que lon cherche fixer un seuil court terme

4496920 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4496921 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4496922 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4496923 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4496924 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4496925 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4496926 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4496927 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4496928 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4496929 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4496930 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4496931 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4496932 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4496933 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4496934 who are open to doing something on the production side
4496935 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4496936 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4496937 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4496938 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4496939 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4496940 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4496941 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4496942 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4496943 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4496944 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4496945 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4496946 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4496947 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4496948 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4496949 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4496950 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4496951 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4496952 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4496953 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4496954 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4496955 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4496956 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4496957 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4496958 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4496959 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4496960 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4496961 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4496962 an adult wearing a life jacket would have great difficulty where she went in
4496963 a 12 year old without a life jacket who allegedly was a non swimmer would not stand much of a chance at all
4496964 through that section the current is about 15 to 18 miles per hour
4496965 that may not seem like very fast when youre driving a car but for the rapids thats flying absolutely flying
4496966 i dont think one adult could possibly keep track of 23 teenagers
4496967 depending on where you live and where you see the advertisement your family could sign you up for this activities camp here in niagara falls
4496968 so the kids came from different areas and found out about it in different ways
4496969 my goal remains to professionalize our inspections divisions through increased and ongoing training
4496970 as with the residential inspectors this was not the outcome we had hoped for but we must move forward with a professionalized staff
4496971 this is a complete sham to cover up management failures
4496972 it is no secret that dcra is a mess this is endemic to what weve seen in other d c agencies and frankly we are concerned as there is no legal reason why these inspectors should be fired
4496973 this was built by locals and now its being renovated by local people families that identify with newfane
4496974 it fit into what they wanted to do it was both plans coming together
4496975 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4496976 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4496977 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4496978 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4496979 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4496980 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4496981 eventually we came up with enough flavors so we were like maybe we should just do this so were more than just competing
4496982 it has a flavor you cant even put your flavor on
4496983 it doesnt taste bitter like beer it tastes like ice cream but definitely guinness flavored ice cream
4496984 it gives the kids an opportunity to see what the police cars have in them and why we do the things we do
4496985 all the police stuff is great but what theyre learning as far as life skills is even more important
4496986 there are things that many of these kids have never done never seen that they get an opportunity to that they wouldnt any other way
4496987 these kids work hard and they deserve it were trying to show them that if you work hard anythings possible
4496988 instead of seeing us out in the housing authority area being enforcers of the law now they see us out playing kickball swimming and running with them
4496989 i used to be scared of policemen but ive loosened up a bit
4496990 theyre really nice and they teach you new things about their experiences and what theyve been through they tell stories
4496991 they have face and a name its not just somebody at the police department
4496992 as soon as we show up on scene if its one of the staff thats been here working with these kids and these people know them it immediately de escalates the situation
4496993 for me the greatest feeling is when you drive through garden street or gabriel drive and i see 20 kids screaming officer haak and running up to my car
4496994 if youve got kids around water particularly dangerous water they should have a life jacket
4496995 it would be best to go on a guided tour with the state parks staff
4496996 but at the same time we encourage people who are capable of going down there to experience the beauty of the gorge
4496997 so unless they sought our advice we couldnt offer it
4496998 when you go off the trail and start going into a dangerous area thats when youll get into trouble
4496999 we urge caution and do our best to advise people as to what they should be experiencing there
4497000 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being
4497001 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4497002 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4497003 the word begotten of the father from on high inexpressibly inexplicably incomprehensibly and eternally is he that is born in time here below of the virgin mary the mother of god
4497004 the virgin mary being obedient to his word received from an angel the glad tidings that she would bear god
4497005 i applaud their efforts but this is the first i heard about it
4497006 nobody has talked to any of the neighbors theyve given us just a brief outline of their plans
4497007 it sounds like a good thing so long as they do their screenings i guess i dont have to be concerned
4497008 we have four children and i just want to make sure there are no sex offenders that can harm our children
4497009 we didnt want any misinformation to get out in case things didnt get worked out we were concerned about the security and safety of the home as well
4497010 i planned on staying there the rest of my life they gave me two months ive been a good tenant
4497011 we know that there are hundreds of homeless in niagara county at st johns we alone took care of 150 homeless last year
4497012 theres a great need in this community for this endeavor
4497013 there will not be any drugs or alcohol on the premises
4497014 theyre going to be pro active were going to be pro active this is going to be an asset to the neighborhood to the community
4497015 it was taking a lot of money every week even 15 cents helps
4497016 apparently the camp they are on is so large that it has its own fire department
4497017 wed seen pictures of the guys doing operations drilling and practicing and the equipment they use
4497018 you see one or two guys with turnout gear on and the rest of them just have fatigues
4497019 if you put the word out that there are things that are needed the fire companies usually and always do come through
4497020 its great to see the fire companies support the troops that are over there volunteering themselves
4497021 as we were packing it there was a lot of camaraderie a lot of wishing gary was here with us doing it
4497022 we were taking a lot of pictures and we sent some pictures with them its just a warm fuzzy kind of feeling you know
4497023 this is not their job their job is still their other assignment they do this just in their spare time
4497024 the way i feel its just showing how the volunteer firefighters get together to help each other out
4497025 but its a nice thing to bring all the restaurants together
4497026 we try to stick with some of our regular staples
4497027 its easy to make and its probably our most popular especially after we won
4497028 the next week after that was pretty much all portabella mushrooms
4497029 we learned a lot from last year so hopefully well be more efficient
4497030 events are really good for us as far as getting new people and people finding out were down here and we serve more than just coffee
4497031 every year we introduce something new you get an item like that at a public event and you know its going to be a winner on your menu
4497032 we always try to do the best we can and hopefully well come out as a winner

4497037 the light will change to the hazard color the person coming straight will try and beat the light they both say they had the right of way
4497038 theyve worked so hard on this thing i think theyre just a little frustrated
4497039 were going to get it done very soon im not lifting the moratorium until were done
4497040 it will probably start off with the basics and go from there
4497041 im hoping they will see what i see that this is an economic engine for niagara county

4497056 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
4497057 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
4497058 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
4497059 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
4497060 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
4497061 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
4497062 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
4497063 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
4497064 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
4497065 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
4497066 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
4497067 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
4497068 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
4497069 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
4497070 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
4497071 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

4497077 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
4497078 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
4497079 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
4497080 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
4497081 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this

4497087 has a false fake birth certificate posted on their website
4497088 has a false fake birth certificate posted on their website
4497089 the campaign has a false fake birth certificate posted on their website the original birth certificate of obama has never been released and the campaign refuses to release it
4497090 well couldnt it just be a state of hawaii produced duplicate
4497091 no its a theres been good analysis of it on the internet and its been shown to have watermarks from photoshop its a fake document thats on the website right now
4497092 responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
4497093 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
4497094 and whether it shows through depends on how much force was put into it
4497095 potentially if you have that number you could break into the system
4497096 to see if they could try and resolve the issue with the people who were asking questions
4497097 they responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
4497098 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
4497099 there is not one shred of evidence to disprove politifacts conclusion that the candidates name is barack hussein obama or to support allegations that the birth certificate he released isnt authentic and thats true no matter how many people cling to some hint of doubt and use the internet to fuel their innate sense of distrust
4497100 it kind of reminds me of vladimir putin invading georgia
4497101 what we must bear in mind is that it is being in christ that makes us abrahams seed and therefore heirs according to the promise
4497102 quienes usando sus cargos gerenciales intimidan a los trabajadores para que se afilien a dicho sindicato

4497144 while pets are mere property in the eyes of the law the difference between a cat and a stereo is self evident
4497145 before this law a lot of well meaning peoples hands were tied when they found pets in empty homes of course the most important thing is for folks not to abandon their pets in the first place but at least now these unlucky animals will have a chance to get the life saving care they need
4497146 ik vertelde hem dat we een bod van 32 miljoen euro hadden ontvangen van chelsea en dat robinho de club wilde verlaten
4497147 dat was duidelijk niet naar de zin van calderon hij wilde niet horen dat robinho ongelukkig is maar wil er ook niets aan doen hij zei zelfs al bood chelsea 100 miljoen euro dan nog wilde hij mijn speler niet laten gaan hij kwam mij heel empathiek over
4497148 je kan dit vergelijken met de zaak met ronaldo fifa voorzitter sepp blatter vergelijkte die zaak met slavernij ik durf dan ook gerust zeggen dat real madrid robinho aan het behandelen is als een slaaf
4497149 on our return trip from south africa a couple of weeks ago i found myself thumbing through an article about
4497150 if you are afraid then you have to lock yourself inside your house but if you want to keep on living then you must forget about your fears and deal with death as something that is a must something thats going to happen anyway even if you dont die this way you can die normally naturally whatever you do youre not going to change this
4497151 i may die il probably die but im going to keep going anyway

4497155 the olympics is not a platform for li nings marketing the reason he wore our shoes is because the olympic committee did not provide shoes
4497156 since the best athletes from other african countries have signed with the big brands li ning had to turn to sudan which is quite competitive
4497157 five years ago li ning was called a domestic brand and in china at that time it was the kiss of death
4497158 its about getting a good product and creating an emotion around it its not rocket science

4497174 there is a beautiful irony that the nostalgic cabaret that is my bloody valentine are throwing at people in 2008 gets critical acclaim in the easily pleased uk press with mbv still playing the exact same set they did 20 years ago

4497177 artists who dare to portray the gay jesus have had their work destroyed if they can find a way to exhibit it at all now these powerful images are available for all to see at jesusinlove org
4497178 we did extensive research to find these cutting edge paintings and other resources that show jesus as gay or bisexual transgender or female
4497179 the gay jesus image is emerging now in artwork books and theology
4497180 it is appropriate even essential to explore jesus same sex attractions and female side because in him god became flesh a total shocking identification with all people including the sexually marginalized

4497185 a principal thing to write in the notebook of our minds in the area of human relationships is when people insist on perfection or nothing they get nothing when people insist on having what they daydream as a perfect relationship they will end up having no relationship at all when people waste the time they could have by screaming for more they will have no time at all the waste of what could be by demanding what cannot be is something we all have lived through in certain periods of our lives but which we need to put behind us with resolve

4497188 after my semifinal yesterday i was in the warm down pool and i was crying in my goggles a little bit
4497189 ive been swimming for 20 years and its a sport that i love so much
4497190 its going to be a tough goodbye but i think its time
4497191 shes been very consistent and her physical fitness has been excellent this year
4497192 i heard that a couple of months back and i immediately let it bounce off my back
4497193 i respect her and her diving and she deserves a lot of credit as a diver and i dont really know her as a person
4497194 she can make some noise this year but shes definitely a contender down the road
4497195 ok just a couple more times get it down to 50 that will be good
4497196 wait a minute this doesnt make any sense my snooze button cant control any of this

4497202 after the air crash involving sosoliso and bellview airlines government issued a statement that aero and virgin nigeria were the only safe airlines in the country and since then people decided to fly the two airlines while people were rushing to buy their tickets other airlines would be flying half empty aircraft
4497203 in its capacity as a flag carrier does not do or permit to be done anything which would violate nigerian laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to matters of strategic security and economic interest of the federal republic of nigeria
4497204 we will continue to stop drug barons and their cohorts from denting the good image of the country and from destroying innocent lives
4497205 it has not been easy financing my studies the help i requested for has landed me in trouble this is my first time i did not even negotiate with the person that gave me the drugs i only asked him for n25 000 and he introduced me into drugs
4497206 we had serious talks over some issues and i gave the guys a piece of my mind we have to know what were here for and approach our games with business like attitude
4497207 i am not blaming anyone but we have taken things a bit too easy in the previous games and i needed to let them know that we have got to the crunch and it gets much tougher from here
4497208 its my birthday today thursday but im not looking forward to a better present from the boys than victory over the ivoriens on saturday
4497209 it is important for the boys to go into the match with a lot of seriousness and business like approach and avoid the little mistakes that can cost a team dearly at a stage like this
4497210 the most important thing i learnt in politics is never to be hypocritical in all your dealings with politicians and the people by this you must avoid treachery in all its ramifications what is happening in zamfara state today as far as i am concerned is fuelled by people who double speak and speak untruth i dont want to be misunderstood but i tell you we made some basic and fundamental mistakes when we were in power from 1999 to 2007 we are humans and we are bound to make such mistakes but the good thing is that one of our own governor mahmud aliyu shinkafi has realised our mistakes and is righting them today so we owe our state a duty to support him to achieve his goals ahmed sani yarima was the head of last administration which i was part of i know and it is a fact that some basic amenities that ought to have been provided by that regime were not provided some towns needed roads we did not provide some needed hospitals and the likes but were not provided so since we have gotten some one among us who is providing these facilities we should support him in whatever way we can
4497211 i only imagine what would have been happening to us all had either the pdp or dpp won the state as i said we should be grateful one of our own is doing the work and is doing it well
4497212 the governor shinkafi is my friend and my leader i will never turn my back against him being a member of a respected profession law and with my years in politics i dont think any one will tell me who to support or what to do in this job i am too old to be used in going round town with some thugs disturbing the peace of the state that is wrong and that action should be condemned by all right thinking individuals who wish our state well
4497213 from the day i joined politics i know that one day i will be asked to render accounts of what i did either here or in the hereafter so once any one is invited to render his accounts he or she should not hesitate to do so
4497214 i feel people are making unfounded allegations about the resource we are earning but compared to the volume of work we are doing i believe we deserve more pay
4497215 since they elected me to protect their interests i will do that with my energy my time and with my resources
4497216 as part of my legislative duties i ensured that the sum of n1 4 billion was set aside in this years budget for the repair of the dilapidated anka bukkuyum gummi road in addition we have also budgeted for 40 hand pumps for some rural communities in my constituency this is just the beginning i am sure by next year other projects we have earmarked will be budgeted for for the benefit of our communities
4497217 by that i mean for instance that we dont have power we have to run on generators and running on generators as you know comes with the associated problem of getting diesel the price of which is prohibitive
4497218 yes the government is talking of reforms and we are talking of reforms
4497219 otherwise we would be going in different directions we are a government organisation and we have been doing reforms since the world is changing organisations also have to change if you dont change you cant adapt to changes the world is a global village now and citizens are becoming more and more aware of their rights and expectations you cant improve your services without reforms our reforms are supposed to help government achieve their objectives
4497220 we believe in standard being a world class company registry first of all meant that we must have standards and those standards should not be decided internally by us they must be standards set by some outside agency preferably an international organisation this is what prompted us to embark on our iso certification process which we have accomplished and feel that it is a starting point since corporate improvement is a continual process
4497221 compare favorably with industrialised countries such as canada the united states and australia
4497222 nigeria is now meeting or exceeding word class standards in the time it takes to register a business
4497223 since 2001 the corporate affairs commission cac the government agency charged with business start up procedures has totally revamped its operations upgrading its technology rooted our corruption and increased morale with a renewed focus on customer service
4497224 registering a business has become significantly easier due to a computerised registry and newly established zonal branches of the countrys corporate affairs commission and stamp duty offices
4497225 i still refer to it as the good old days
4497226 i recall that the civil service and companies used to come to the universities to conduct interviews even before your final examinations by the time i finished at abu i was offered employment in the ministry of justice i went to law school as a legal trainee by the time we came back from the nysc i was in the ministry of justice briefly before i transferred to the judiciary and was sworn in as a magistrate
4497227 the ones that are most frequently asked as they affect us are trade enquiries is this company registered who are their directors how are they performing are they genuine business men and women people want to know whether they are dealing with genuine people
4497228 it is not that we are going to open an office in america
4497229 i dont want you to think that we are going to new york for instance hire buildings put in some staff and operate from there that is not what we are going to do we are using the same internet we are going to give them access
4497230 right now we are giving some nigerians in the us the opportunity to access to our database so that they dont have to come to us physically to conduct searches
4497231 our customer service personnel routinely put members of the public through the procedures of forming these two categories of businesses
4497232 and it may surprise you to know that most law and accounting firms register business names without the assistance of agents
4497233 we naturally advice people to consult accredited agents because the process of company formation is a legal as well as an accounting matter
4497234 our accredited agents of over 15 000 consist of lawyers chartered accountants and chartered secretaries

4497299 this partnership will also provide a good way to spread facts about soy biodiesel in urban areas
4497300 because illinois is a top producing soybean state and the top state for consumption of biodiesel this promotion is a natural fit for the illinois soybean association
4497301 illinois soybean growers have a special respect for abraham lincoln and we are proud to have biodiesel displayed on the unit which displays such an important part of u s and illinois history

4497326 unfortunately russia has tended to view the expansion of freedom and democracy as a threat to its interests
4497327 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4497328 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4497329 president bush is guiding u s relations with russia in a decidedly confrontational direction evoking memories of cold war bitterness
4497330 its a marked turnabout from the sense of his soul epiphany the president had seven years ago when he declared that vladimir putin was a trustworthy partner on the global stage
4497331 the administration is a bit behind the curve on this they didnt understand what was coming said janusz bugajski director of a new european democracies project at the center for strategic and international studies in washington
4497332 putin is the only world leader who landed the bush reward trifecta visits to the presidents texas ranch the camp david retreat in marylands catoctin mountains and his parents summer home in maine
4497333 but there was a big problem underlying the basic strategy bushs assumption that a weak debt ridden post soviet russia would seek to become more western and thus would share u s strategic interests bugajski said the president also was distracted by iraq and afghanistan
4497334 russia meanwhile was operating on a very different view becoming ever richer off energy revenues it worked to take advantage of what it sees as a declining america to split the u s from traditional allies such as france and germany and to reassert its global role
4497335 russias military offensive into georgia has jolted the bush administrations relationship with moscow senior officials said thursday forcing a wholesale reassessment of american dealings with russia and jeopardizing talks on everything from halting irans nuclear ambitions to reducing strategic arsenals to cooperation on missiles defenses
4497336 theres a grand sweep to all this that is not present in any other game seeing the fleets form up watching the capital ships jump en masse seeing the dreadnoughts engage enemy structures its got the kind of bombast and enormity that no other game before or since online or off has been able to capture not only that but the logistics espionage and counter espionage all add up to a game that has more depth than the nine circles of hell
4497337 theres no equivalent experience in gaming to that of being caught up in the enormous communal effort of several thousand people trying to defend their slice of the universe or to take what belongs to someone else
4497338 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus

4497342 mr barry collier my question without notice is to the premier what is the latest information on the governments initiatives to bring greater accountability to the mr morris iemma the new south wales court system is the biggest in australia and it handles more cases than any other jurisdiction the community quite rightly expects that our judges and magistrates are highly skilled and proficient and that they conduct themselves in a professional manner the government is determined to ensure that these community expectations are met we are the only jurisdiction in australia with an independent statutory body the judicial commission of new south wales it examines complaints about judges and magistrates we have instituted reforms in recent years following the review of the laws governing judicial officers such as strengthening the complaints handling process by introducing guidelines on the treatment and investigation of grievances and introducing new and expanded powers requiring judicial officers to undergo medical examinations but the changes do not stop there last year i committed to making the supervision of our judges and magistrates more reflective of community values i committed to appointing two community representatives to the conduct division of the judicial commission this important body examines the most serious complaints against judicial officers and complaints that require further independent scrutiny it may initiate any investigation it deems appropriate when it considers that a complaint may warrant the removal of a judicial officer from office its report is tabled in both houses of parliament today i am pleased to deliver on that commitment by announcing that the government will nominate ken moroney and martha jabour as community representatives of the conduct division of the judicial commission the appointment of mr maroney and ms jabour will bring greater transparency and more accountability to this process our reforms will see this most important body opened up to the views of the wider community ms jabour is the executive director of the homicide victims support group and she has held that position since 1993 this group is one of the largest homicide victims support groups in the world helping tens of thousands of people who are directly and indirectly affected by the worst categories of crime ms jabour is also a current serving member of the new south wales sentencing council the new south wales victims advisory board and the state parole authority she has previously served on she will bring to this new role a great deal of experience as a representative of the conduct division mr jabour will be an important voice reflecting community values in i am pleased to announce that the other community representative is mr ken moroney last year mr moroney retired as new south wales commissioner of police after a distinguished 40 year career in the new south wales police force mr moroneys service to this state has been significant and he has been recognised by numerous honours and awards operationally mr moroney has been recognised for his service during the strathfield massacre the thredbo landslide the sydney 2000 olympic games and the 2001 christmas bushfires he is a recipient of both the national medal and the australian police medal and in 2006 he was appointed as an officer of the general division of the order of australia in recognition of his distinguished service to policing he served as the new south wales commissioner of police from may 2002 until august 2007 ken moroney and martha jabour are both people of high standing in the community their appointment will further strengthen community confidence in the judiciary
4497343 last year i committed to making the supervision of our judges and magistrates more reflective of community values
4497344 audrina patridge works at epic records where we are signed
4497345 she set up a little showcase for us were new to the label and they filmed it which is kinda of cool
4497346 only 54 percent of eligible american voters cast their ballots half of them are only voting cause its cool to vote for so and so they arent even up to date on information
4497347 im personally not up to date on the facts so i dont wanna make a stupid choice for our country i want to vote but only when i know exactly whats going on more ppl should think like that paris hilton said yaaaay go vote cause its cool and hott she wasnt even registered
4497348 seriously second of all thank you to the people who support me in my comments against the press they really are stupid and report false news for the mean green i feel bad for you guys they are teaching our young generation how to be catty

4497351 every moment were associated with the olympics is a great moment as far as were concerned its gotten our name out
4497352 whats fantastic is our ability to build our brand across the world you know were known and trusted in china one in three computers sold in china are lenovo computers what we want to do is to bridge that gap and be able to become as trusted outside of china as we are inside of china
4497353 there were three cities that you know had some issues london paris and san francisco but literally the other hundred cities that we went to people were celebrating literally thousands in some cases millions in some cities in china
4497354 outside the so called big four manchester united chelsea liverpool and arsenal there are some difficulties facing the clubs financially
4497355 given the present economic climate it is understandable that banks are more reluctant to lend but this may also reflect a deep seated unease about the financial viability of some premiership clubs
4497356 we have so far only seen the beginnings of the credit crunch ripple effect
4497357 it is proving to be a reality check for the big teams who are having to look at ways of tightening their belts which should ensure the long term future of the game
4497358 this will almost certainly help clubs gain control over their finances and focus resources on their best players
4497359 people have to be realistic a few more players might arrive but not for big money
4497360 the credit crunch is there and everybody has been affected by it we dont get away just because we are a football club
4497361 the banks are now tighter and not prepared to put debt on you just cannot continue to increase debts
4497362 they dont want to attach themselves to a club which with great respect to west brom may not be in the premier league within 12 months time
4497363 theres not a good track record of clubs going up and staying up and sponsors are looking for a long term deal so this may be where it got a bit tricky for them
4497364 its an unusual situation to be able to buy a traditional shirt after all these years without a garish logo on it
4497365 the inspiration for all my work comes from the ever changing relationship between the weather light land and sea
4497366 yorkshire had everything i was looking for when i planned this exhibition of paintings
4497367 the coastline for example is rich with high clifftops rugged seas small fishing villages and i have witnessed some dramatic skies there that would be the envy of anywhere in the world
4497368 moving inland across the north yorkshire moors there is an ever shifting array of colour through the seasons from the burnt moorland of spring and early summer to the beautiful heather clad hills of late summer
4497369 painting in such places is a real challenge and a joy
4497370 i enjoyed the challenge of playing a character as dark as heathcliff you have to bring your own darkness to it
4497371 i had already written a really really terrible wuthering heights musical and my brother convinced me go somewhere else with that because everyones dead at the end its just depressing you need to have something positive
4497372 so i looked around for another story that would be equally romantic and epic and have all those passions that i found so intriguing as a teenager and i read a tale of two cities and i fell in love with it
4497373 my dear john letter to him was more or less a copy of janes confession to mr rochester i wished i was more beautiful i said better educated and of better social standing but my spirit was equal to his and i wanted to be treated as an equal if i wasnt as important to him as he to me i just had to give him up
4497374 traditionally a person was defined by relationships and the individual didnt have a place
4497375 in my own transformation jane eyre played an important part the book struck a chord
4497376 he was interviewed and confessed to me the above mentioned incidents
4497377 the citizens are not allowed to carry guns on the street but there are criminals who do carry guns on the street
4497378 it isnt fun to not have the governors house and all the other constitutional offices
4497379 why on earth would anybody vote for a democrat in this state in the next election
4497380 i think its easier to come together because we dont control anything
4497381 democrats control everything and then they have power struggles like whos the alpha donkey
4497382 weve seen a democratic administration that has been totally inept
4497383 really everything was there for them to do their bidding because of power struggles theyve really messed things up
4497384 i think you just need to continue to be vocal on what the minority party stands for and people will resonate to it
4497385 it looked like an option and the way we wanted to go
4497386 were happy with whats been going on but the question is how well it will wear
4497387 other communities in the midwest seem to be happy with it
4497388 if the base is too far gone or the asphalt is too far gone it cant be recycled
4497389 but thats when it was in its baby stages it was nowhere near the procedure its at now
4497390 ken moroney former nsw police commissioner and martha jabour executive director of the nsw homicides victims support group will be appointed as community representatives to the judicial commission of nsw to hear complaints about judicial officers
4497391 ken moroney and martha jabour are highly respected figures in the law and order establishment and the community in general
4497392 together they bring decades of experience to the judicial commission and will help ensure it continues to carry out its works with the utmost integrity and professionalism
4497393 these appointments will strengthen public confidence in the process for dealing with complaints relating to judicial officers and in our legal system
4497394 public confidence in the process for dealing with complaints relating to judicial officers and in our legal system
4497395 he kissed me on the lips and then he gave me a filterless cigarette
4497396 i came over all light headed and had to sit on his dressing room steps maybe it was the cigarette and nothing to do with the legend
4497397 it made me feel a little embarrassed to be honest it made me a little sad it hurt my feelings
4497398 i am in a pretty good workout regimen that i like so it inspired me to keep it up the energy level and the way i feel now is great
4497399 she told me they said some rude mean things but thats not why i wanted to change

4497403 for them to strike when they feel like it and then not to collect our rubbish is just not on
4497404 it was not planned it was a spur of the moment reaction
4497405 we dont know what will happen next week we are expecting repercussions but we will have to wait and see
4497406 the collection crews always do their best to collect everyones waste
4497407 individual residents can sometimes become agitated and frustrated and the aim of the crew is to deal with such situations calmly listen to residents concerns and then get the job done of collecting everyones refuse and emptying everyones bins
4497408 this minor incident was quickly resolved in line with what we would expect of our collection crews
4497409 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
4497410 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4497411 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he and she said yes
4497412 he ronson wants to write his own tunes instead of everyone elses he needs to learn three chords on the guitar and go and write a tune

4497414 the next series deals with the fallout and aftermath of series one its definitely political it deals with a subject in american history in which people might not see a sense of irony or black humour
4497415 we were not holding hands but no one believes me it was the angle of the picture
4497416 the whole time was awkward for me it wasnt pleasant the press were writing about us what could i do if someone says i shouldnt be somewhere am i not going to ever leave my house
4497417 if we dont do this now carcass will be erased from the history of rock to a certain extent
4497418 theres so much access to information out there but it seems to me that the new generation of kids just really dont know s t they dont really know who black sabbath is never mind carcass theres definitely a generation of kids out there who are not aware of carcass because we havent been around for 15 years a year is a long time in metal these days
4497419 never say never but i cant see it happening i cant see it working it would be sad i think these bands that start playing again some of them get carried away and they write an album and they start saying its the best thing we ever done and then it just isnt we dont want to be one of those bands we dont want to be doing this next year i could maybe see us playing again in some of the countries that were not touching this year but lets see if we kill each other when were in north america on a tour bus
4497420 i dont think i want a g f right now please understand

4497802 if i may be so bold there was another president
4497803 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4497804 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4497805 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4497806 part of a strategic energy corridor affecting individual lives far beyond
4497807 these are the kinds of things that the president should have been saying from the beginning
4497808 we want to avoid any armed conflict and we will not have armed conflict
4497809 thats not the solution to this problem but we have to stand up for freedom and democracy as we did in the darkest days
4497810 you know i think he spends less time on his presidential campaign these days and lots of time on georgia
4497811 and i really appreciate that because senator mccain has been fighting for freedom of georgia for many many years

4497818 the american psychological associations so called study is nothing more than a conclusion supported by opinions screened to match that predetermined outcome
4497819 there is no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women
4497820 this finding was expected given the composition of the apa task force pro choice in a pro choice organization but provides testimony to the bias of apa in not even meeting with groups who represent women who believe abortion did lead to significant mental health problems
4497821 several groups sought to meet with apa but were rebuffed
4497822 the apa brushed them off just like it dismissed any scientific study that didnt agree with its agenda
4497823 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
4497824 while we received repeated judgments from the courts that validated our rights we were unable until now to finally put this lawsuit behind us

4497831 the story of the labor movement is filled with millions of stories many of which are never reported this week one of those stories was yesterday two members of sheet metal workers local 17 in boston were honored for rescuing a commuter who had fallen onto the train tracks at bostons north station the commuter a man in his mid 50s had stumbled off the platform and fallen five feet onto the tracks with his arms resting inches away from the 600 volt third rail the two sheet metal workers a j pugliese jr and robert johnson jr heard the shouts for help from several commuters standing on the platform in a video released by the mbta the two men are seen springing into action while risking their own safety by crossing the electrified third rail and dragging the unconscious commuter to safety

4497886 obamas transformation if you go by his campaign so far would mean higher income taxes higher social security taxes higher investment taxes higher corporate taxes massive new domestic spending and a healthcare plan that perhaps could be the next step to a full scale single payer system is that what most americans want someone who will fulfill a democratic policy wish list
4497887 obamas proposal would impose social security taxes on income above 250 000 per year he would continue to exempt income between 102 000 and 250 000 from social security taxes
4497888 i would roll back the bush tax cuts for those making over 250 000
4497889 are frequently subject to the highest individual income tax rates
4497890 changes in the individual income tax affect most businesses in the united states that is because taxes on business earnings are often paid through the individual income tax when passed through to business owners the business income from sole proprietorships farm proprietorships partnerships s corporations etc is all taxed at the owners individual income tax rates this year 34 million business owners are expected to receive this type of income and pay tax on this income through the individual income tax these businesses are typically small and often entrepreneurial in nature and a source of innovation and risk taking in the economy moreover these business owners are frequently subject to the highest individual income tax rates
4497891 sen obama wants to raise the long term capital gains rate for families making more than 250 000 to around 20 percent or somewhat higher but not above the 28 percent level it reached during the reagan presidency an obama economic adviser says the same rate would apply to most dividend income for these investors
4497892 individual income and tax data by state and size of adjusted gross income tax year 2006
4497893 what we ought to tax is dirty energy like coal and to a lesser extent natural gas
4497894 and i found this fascinating maria that on the issue of taxes he looked to insulate himself by saying that if in fact economic conditions justify the fact that it might harm the economy he might be willing to hold off some of his tax increases when he takes office in january lets take a listen to barack obama
4497895 some of those you could possibly defer but i think the basic principle of restoring fairness to our economy and encouraging bottom up economic growth is important so heres what we know we know that over the last decade or so that more than half of the economic growth has been captured by the top one percent of u s citizens that means the other 99 percent have seen their effective incomes go down that is not a recipe for long term economic growth
4497896 even though senator obamas plan eliminates individual income taxes for seniors with incomes less than 50 000 his plan would raise taxes for almost 10 million senior households over a third of the total not shown in table on average seniors would face a tax increase of about 2 percent of income
4497897 a preliminary analysis of the 2008 presidential candidates tax plans
4497898 the clear implication is that raising the u s personal income tax rates would also stunt small business entrepreneurship yet this is precisely what all of the democratic presidential candidates and even mr rangel propose
4497899 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
4497900 but with barack obama promising to raise rates to french like levels this taxman cometh policy could turn americans into the worlds foremost fiscal prisoners
4497901 and speaking of tax rates celebrity chef alain ducasse changed his citizenship this month from high tax france to no income tax monaco he says it wasnt a financial decision but an affair of the heart of course nonetheless plenty of other frenchmen have moved abroad to escape their countrys confiscatory taxes americans should be so lucky ours is the only industrialized country that taxes its citizens even if they live overseas that hasnt been a big problem as long as u s tax rates have been relatively low but with barack obama promising to raise rates to french like levels this taxman cometh policy could turn americans into the worlds foremost fiscal prisoners
4497902 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
4497903 obama wants to the raise tax rate on the top income bracket from 35 percent to 39 6 percent nearly double the tax rate on capital gains and dividends and eliminate all tax breaks for the gas and oil industries and private equity firm managers talk about a recipe for economic disaster
4497904 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
4497905 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
4497906 he also wants to send working families a 1 000 energy rebate funded by new taxes on oil companies a move that would slow the oil giants investments in research exploration and recovery and thus could ultimately cause oil prices to rise even further
4497907 however mr obamas proposal to take some of this money from big oil and distribute it like robin hood to hard pressed american families doesnt make economic sense but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help
4497908 from 1980 to 1988 the wpt may have reduced domestic oil production anywhere from 1 2 to 8 0 320 to 1 269 million barrels dependence on imported oil grew from between 3 and 13
4497909 the crude oil windfall profit tax of the 1980s implications for current energy policy
4497910 the wpt had the effect of reducing the domestic supply of crude oil below what the supply would have been without the tax this increased the demand for imported oil and made the united states more dependent upon foreign oil as compared with dependence without a wpt
4497911 the crude oil windfall profit tax of the 1980s implications for current energy policy
4497912 the last time congress imposed a form of the windfall tax was the final gloomy days of jimmy carter and the result was a substantial reduction in domestic oil production about 5 thus raising the price of gas at the pump and a 10 increase in u s reliance on foreign oil a windfall profits tax is the ultimate act of economic masochism because it taxes only domestic production while imports and foreign oil subsidiaries bear almost none of the cost
4497913 48a on the 12v or 25a on 12v1 and 25a on 12v2
4497914 were seeing what impact movies such as an inconvenient truth can have on our society
4497915 were also beginning to see that students are showing a demand to learn about environmental issues and that business have a demand to hire people with this knowledge
4497916 training a new generation of scholars and practitioners and developing practical solutions to some of the most pressing environmental economic and social challenges of sustainability
4497917 the urgency and scale of conservation problems to the public and policy makers and to motivate the global community to try to reduce species extinctions
4497918 we believe the worst of the current financial ordeal is behind us though it is still too early to expect a broad recovery in the economy fortunately we believe there are bright spots in the economy areas of strength to provide select investment opportunities in an otherwise difficult market
4497919 i think its going to come down to who he feels comfortable with
4497920 like dick armey ben nighthorse campbell and ronald reagan before him tony bouie found a home in the republican party
4497921 its a primary campaign i would expect seel to use whatever information he had to help his campaign
4497922 we want democrats to switch that is what we try to do convince them our ideas are better so they should join us
4497923 h e is very impressive and a solid guy small business owner fiscally conservative socially conservative whats not to like
4497924 so did crump and you dont see any of them out for crumps head one maricopa county leader who agreed to talk to
4497925 left leaning rs reach positions of power the open border crowd cannot be permitted to elect folks who will weaken our defense against invasion by people who will skirt our legal system i would be delighted to have ds convert to rs but the question must be asked what took you so long and why are you running against proven rs
4497926 he didnt know what employer sanctions were he didnt know if he would sign a no new taxes pledge and wouldnt answer the question until he asked his consultant first he favors affirmative action and so on and so on early indications are that he doesnt know what he thinks about many issues but those issues he does have an opinion on do not reflect positions that are consistent with this partys platform
4497927 this is yet another reason why republicans are doing so poorly in arizona theyre focusing on internal ideological purity tests instead of actually solving problems voters care about
4497928 i think its going to come down to who he feels comfortable with
4497929 then he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am tormented in this flame
4497930 he too will drink of the wine of gods fury which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath he will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the lamb i e god the son jesus christ and the christians who managed to be saved in spite of all the hurdles that he set up john 17 24 and the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever there is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image or for anyone who receives the mark of his name
4497931 i started painting in the late 1970s when i was 35 or 36
4497932 i started by doing traditional stories using dot painting and then i wanted to change my style to more abstract
4497933 there were dot paintings everywhere i wanted it to be unique something that made people think
4497934 i did the first one in 1998 it was funny i laughed i had splashed paint all over my shoes but it was worth it it worked it came out very good everybody loved it
4497935 he all but abandoned the familiar dot style and his single image paintings were seen as an idiosyncratic incursion into australian modernism at a time when aboriginal art and the idea of lyrical expressionism might be regarded as opposites
4497936 two old men in a circle sitting around having a meeting discussing everything

4498281 from a technology angle our troops are on operations deployed in very challenging areas so we feel its important to look at the technology available and see what can be done to help them identify the threats and take appropriate action the technology today is good enough to be adapted to some kind of platform that can help the troops in this way

4498302 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4498303 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4498304 i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam

4498314 the point that mccain was making is that people can differ on one issue and still be a vital member of our party

4498320 three hours you have barely enough time to play it through once

4498322 the pay was so low that unless we could drive to these concerts we couldnt make ends meet
4498323 imagine playing in one town driving 500 miles and playing the next night we did it many times
4498324 the driving motive was you looked for a way of expressing yourself
4498325 you felt that there must be more to life than making a living
4498326 i can only answer with one word that i know it is love i was always hungry for music hungry for music making and it has never left me so even now it is what drives me and what actually makes me feel alive
4498327 i cant see myself retired and sitting down in front of a television set or trying to get a little ball into a hole

4498333 the collection crews always do their best to collect everyones waste
4498334 individual residents can sometimes become agitated and frustrated and the aim of the crew is to deal with such situations calmly listen to residents concerns and then get the job done of collecting everyones refuse and emptying everyones bins
4498335 this minor incident was quickly resolved in line with what we would expect of our collection crews

4498344 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4498345 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4498346 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4498347 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

4498355 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4498356 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4498357 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4498358 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4498359 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4498360 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4498361 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4498362 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4498363 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4498364 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4498365 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4498366 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4498367 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4498368 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4498369 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4498370 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4498371 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4498372 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4498373 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4498374 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4498375 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4498376 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4498377 we have a new guitar player thats gonna play for the first time tomorrow its the first time well play on stage together his name is wes borland and he used to be in a really terrible band that he left because he felt that it was a destructive force in art
4498378 we dont know how permanent borlands membership in the band is
4498379 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4498380 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4498381 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4498382 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4498383 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4498384 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4498385 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4498386 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4498387 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4498388 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4498389 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4498390 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4498391 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4498392 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4498393 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4498394 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4498395 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4498396 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4498397 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4498398 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4498399 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4498400 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4498401 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4498402 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4498403 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4498404 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4498405 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4498406 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4498407 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4498408 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4498409 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4498410 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

4498428 regarded this state of affairs as normal certain and permanent except in the direction of further improvement the projects and politics of militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries of monopolies restrictions and exclusion appeared to exercise almost no influence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life the internationalization of which was nearly complete in practice

4498439 the bible itself is presumed to be the word of god written down by inspired men simply because the men said they were inspired or is there something else also if the entire bible ot and nt are to be the inerrant word how are differences between the ot and nt reconciled im thinking of the largely negative by todays standards ideas such as stoning for various offenses in the ot as compared with the largely positive message in the nt what am i missing i have many more questions but i think this is a good start

4498441 while the middle east and especially the persian gulf will remain a top priority in u s foreign policy regardless of who wins the white house israel is heading toward a strategic environment in which russia may play a more important role especially in its southern tier from the black sea to afghanistan and western china twenty first century geopolitics is presenting significant survival challenges to the jewish state and the region

4498455 there are several priorities to maintain economic stability to develop economic freedoms to promote social programs and to ensure that russia sustains its position in the world
4498456 the future will exceed by a big stretch the plans for 2020
4498457 russia is clearly one of the most successful economic stories of the decade the first scale economy to sustainably avoid the resource curse
4498458 the opposition by definition cannot make any decisions no matter how many seats it has in parliament its job is to criticize
4498459 the majority of citizens have a positive view of the soviet period
4498460 it would be absurd not to take that into account when the cprf was formed its base consisted of a typically soviet contingent the elderly now that is changing there is more of the intelligentsia
4498461 the party is made in such a way that it can only be reformed from the top unfortunately everything depends on what zyuganov will do
4498462 and my presence had not been agreed upon in the presidential administration the president said i should be taken off the list
4498463 in russia there is politics for dupes and real politics
4498464 for dupes there is the british council affair the nashi movement and all those national projects and there is real politics which recently consists mostly of arrests it is striking that the arrest of co owner of the arbat prestige perfume chain semyon mogilevich is the hardest blow to the siloviki party that could have been delivered by gazprom and dmitri medvedev
4498465 i just wish youd wither into a cornucopia and lick a field mouse

4498471 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4498472 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4498473 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4498474 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4498475 on sunday april 13th norsa cyclists alan stewart mike rhodes tim josey and adam domanski successfully completed the epic raleigh to virgilina va road ride a 116 mile trip from central north carolina north to the virginia border town of virgilina and back norsa had attempted the trip back in december but was hampered by 40 degree temperatures and cold rain the cyclists made it only halfway to virgilina and turned back at the town of stem nc virgilina remained in their sights however and april 13th proved to be the day when the weather and everyones schedules cooperated
4498476 the only disappointment from the trip was for alan and adam who experienced a painful revelation of exactly how far the louisville ironman will be
4498477 my client has been subjected to a hostile publicity campaign during these protracted proceedings as well as being subjected to surveillance and unnecessary scrutiny by private investigators
4498478 our client has throughout this process refused to provide any public comment and instead has put her faith in the employment tribunal system hopefully a favourable resolution is now in sight and she intends to make no further comment until the conclusion of the case
4498479 when you finally hear your name called its a great relief
4498480 it was a great week and its something that youre going to look back on for years to come
4498481 i felt that at the start of the week it was just getting adjusted to the speed of the game

4498490 george bushs administration is promoting interests of candidate john mccain
4498491 defeated by barak obama on all fronts mccain has one last card to play yet the creation of a virtual cold war with russia bush himself did not want a war in south ossetia but his republican party did not leave him any choice
4498492 the west has spent a lot of time energy and money to teach georgia the tricks of the trade to make the country look like a democracy
4498493 we and many other nations see through this deceit we understand that the seditious tactics of the so called colour revolutions are a real threat to international law and the source of global legal nihilism
4498494 in the old days under soviet rule we didnt believe a word of our own propaganda but we thought that information was free in the west and we longed for it
4498495 but we have learnt since that the west has its own propaganda and in some ways it is more powerful because people believe it

4498498 are we ready to kill someone to win a game no because you have to respect the rules in football the beauty in the game is to win in respect of the rules
4498499 can you win the league by playing completely non football i dont believe so historically it is proven that the teams who win the league are the better technical teams
4498500 the leading clubs have a responsibility to try to make the games attractive they can never be a long term target to play a dirty game or one which is not attractive
4498501 it is always very nice in pre season and everyone wants to respect each other when it comes to points it becomes a bit different the most important thing is the actions during the game
4498502 when you go to church on a sunday the priest says everyone has to be respectful and generous but when you come out of the church everyone is not generous and respectful
4498503 we feel we were a fraction short last year by not much
4498504 we want to show we can get the four points which made the difference last year between us and the winner
4498505 of course we have lost some players but we have also brought some players we opted for some stability
4498506 lets focus on the short term goals and lets show later on weve learned from when we dropped off last season
4498507 usually the teams which comes up give you a good game and it is our target to win the first game
4498508 he can replace alex hleb in the build up of the game in the creation of the chances and also he is very versatile
4498509 i expect he will fit well into our collective game and that he expresses a good attitude is very ambitious and fights very hard for the team
4498510 he is an intelligent boy and that is always a very good ingredient
4498511 photography is becoming more collectible because it is accessible in terms of price
4498512 you can get a nice photograph for a couple thousand this is so and differs from collecting painting because photography is editioned like traditional prints
4498513 if the artist is mid career i look at what exhibitions they have scheduled for the future who they will be showing with is their work being contextualized with the works of higher valued artists whether or not critics are reviewing their works in aperture artforum etc and what curators have included them in shows and where also if museums have started to collect their work and what tastemakers do too
4498514 works of art that are bought purely for investment reasons are put in a storage facility
4498515 f or tax purposes these works of art cannot be displayed because then the collector or fund manager is deriving physical benefits from being able to view the work the irs has a big problem with that

4498520 we think the reason that it works is because it produces a unique metabolic response
4498521 intermittent sprinting produces high levels of chemical compounds called catecholamines which allow more fat to be burned from under the skin and within the exercising muscles the resulting increase in fat oxidation drives the greater weight loss
4498522 although it is unknown whether children are more susceptible to rf exposure they may be at increased risk because of their developing organ and tissue systems
4498523 another possible explanation for the observed association might be the lack of attention given to a child by mothers who are frequent users of cell phones

4498533 the most riveting thought provoking book ive read in years
4498534 bursting with lessons in faith forgiveness and family it is a modern classic that will be enjoyed and passed along to friends and family for years to come
4498535 if what is used as a medium of exchange is fluctuating in its value it is no better than unjust weights and measures both which are condemned by the laws of god and man and therefore the longest and most universal custom could never make the use of such a medium either lawful or reasonable

4498540 in far too many newsrooms the question is no longer about serving the publics right to know but protecting the public from things it wants to know no wonder theyre looking elsewhere
4498541 the joy of this new film is that not only do you reconnect with the beales you also get a front row seat to the creative process that transformed the maysles film into a moving and award winning broadway musical we are extremely pleased to be associated with such an influential talent as we know this film will be a favorite with our viewers

4498544 as a result of this weeks events the excitement that many of you felt about the show has turned into dissatisfaction and disappointment
4498545 due to these circumstances weve reevaluated our convention hall space and come up with some solutions that will allow us to offer 3 000 more tickets for sale
4498546 to avoid the issues many of you faced this week well be selling these 3 000 via a lottery
4498547 if i had to go through this i could at least be an example of trying to live out whats right trying to stand strong and trying to just keep my faith intact
4498548 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
4498549 this lawsuit in my opinion should not have been filed because nothing happened
4498550 its a great vindication and shows us the faithfulness of god
4498551 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4498552 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4498553 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded there should be no doubt about this
4498554 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100
4498555 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but the strategic potential of russia
4498556 russias invasion of georgia strikes at the heart of western values
4498557 if the international community allows russia to crush our democratic independent state it will be giving carte blanche to authoritarian governments everywhere

4498614 when i started making alt porn movies benny profane was the only other person out there actually putting movies out
4498615 i stalked him back in the day just so i could stand in a room with someone else who was doing this stuff he was putting out his self produced psychocandy line back then which was the first stuff like this on the market
4498616 i have wanted this alt porn pioneer on the roster from the beginning
4498617 in my regular life i have a little brother who looks up to me so i just try to behave for him but people will still say whatever they want to
4498618 the biggest thing ive learned is that everything that seemed so important when you were younger just goes out the window what other people think of you you just dont care anymore when you get a bit older you become more comfortable with yourself
4498619 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights
4498620 i feel like i found my perfect fit shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her
4498621 coastal contacts strongly believes in the fundamental right of canadian consumers to choose where to buy their replacement contact lenses and will vigorously defend such consumer rights
4498622 we take exception to the misleading comments circulated by the college of opticians of british columbia in their attempts to preserve a monopoly
4498623 having delivered more than 200 million pairs of replacement contact lenses to our customers world wide we can proudly say that we have never received a report from a customer identifying any health issue of any kind arising from the products we supplied consistent with this we note that no regulatory or professional body has ever identified any actual health or safety issues which they allege arose from the products we have supplied to our customers
4498624 prescription contact lenses may only be fitted dispensed and otherwise furnished to members of the public by a qualified eye care professional
4498625 by requiring a contact lens prescription and the involvement of an optician who is also a certified contact lens fitter and who must perform in accordance with the professional standards of practice of the college the public is assured that a professional will determine a persons suitability for the particular contact lenses by fitting them and then dispensing them and providing any necessary advice and follow up
4498626 prescription contact lenses are under no circumstances to be supplied to members of the public as if they were merely equivalent to an
4498627 poorly fitted and maintained contact lenses can cause abrasions ulcerations infections and potential loss of eye sight
4498628 we are committed to being part of the solution in support of better outcomes for neglected kentucky horses
4498629 providing education and networking opportunities for equine abuse investigators is a clear way for us to promote the health and welfare of kentucky horses
4498630 we are excited to work with the horse council on this educational project
4498631 this is a great opportunity for us to expand our community presence as part of a larger network of equine resources in eastern kentucky
4498632 transportation fertilizer and pesticide costs are getting so high that small scale farming is really able to compete local natural products are soon going to be at least as cheap to grow and to transport
4498633 whole foods is promoting local goods at many of its regional stores
4498634 that is something that both whole foods and wild oats used to do but had moved away from when they couldnt maintain local suppliers but increasingly reliable suppliers and rising transport costs mean that we are going to see more and more focus on local products
4498635 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
4498636 i think that presidents deserve to be questioned maybe irreverently most of the time to bring em down a size
4498637 access to a president doesnt mean youre gonna get the truth
4498638 i could see president kennedy was struggling so finally i got up and said thank you mr president i got him off the hook
4498639 we never use cluster bombs there is no need to do so
4498640 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw
4498641 russias use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines
4498642 the wind rushes out of the valleys and as it hits the ridge the higher the ridge the more speed it gains as it goes up
4498643 by reducing the ridge altitude by hundreds of feet you change the wind patterns and therefore impact the wind speed
4498644 taking the wind map in gis software i placed the turbines along every part of the ridge at class 4 or higher wind speeds
4498645 using a spacing of three rotor diameters between turbines i found that 220 turbines could fit along the ridges
4498646 a lot of developers are wary of west virginia because most of the places where they propose wind arent in the coal fields theyre in the non coal producing counties where theres a lot of people with summer or winter homes or ski resorts and theres a lot of opposition
4498647 they know what the alternative is here and they know the community members would prefer a wind farm
4498648 and at the same time they know that they have a lot of support on the ground if challenges do come about
4498649 peace advocates will likely have the best funded antiwar message in history
4498650 tens of millions of dollars will be raised for voter education and registration and get out the vote campaigns through the 527 committees which disseminate election messages independent of partisan candidates
4498651 i cant tell you how frustrating it is to watch each day go by with opportunities missed just because we lack the resources to do what we know needs to be done
4498652 if we ufpj had 100 000 a mere fraction of that 100 million we could put organizers in key states around the country and give them the tools to work with for several months
4498653 we need an earned media effort that helps us reframe the war in a cross cutting way that moves a substantial number of americans to take the view that the war is wrong and connect it to a solution namely to safely quickly and completely end the war starting january 21 2009
4498654 we can literally knock on millions of doors on september 20 and get hundreds of thousands of petition signers from all fifty states
4498655 thinking beyond the contemporary mantra of democracy elections and decentralization
4498656 a tension at the international level between promoting poverty reduction and promoting competitive multi party democracy
4498657 in many cases democracies produce governments which are very effective in reducing poverty witness recent experience in brazil for example
4498658 there are less democratic regimes which have been and are very effective in reducing poverty and the international community needs to recognise that part of this effectiveness may be due to the nature of the regime where a strong connection between regime and citizens has been forged through a popular movement which generates a social compact between elite and the poor as part of a national development project
4498659 china and vietnam would also be examples and there are others during the last 60 years the implication for the international community would be to exercise caution in attaching political conditionalities to aid or other international negotiations of course this does not mean that in extreme cases eg zimbabwe the international community should not take a strong political position
4498660 we need to talk about this especially after traumatic events autocracies may do nation building more effectively than elected governments there is more to politics than ballot counting
4498661 shoring up fragile states should be as important to donors as tackling climate change

4498668 with the convergence of broadband and broadcast technology new frontiers lie ahead for nds
4498669 nds needs to have the strategic agility and flexibility to enter into any type of value enhancing transactions the current ownership structure was imposing certain limitations therefore news corp has decided to reduce its ownership position in nds so that nds can capitalize on these new opportunities with a more independent structure and the expertise of permira
4498670 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and securitys going to get worse before it gets better

4498672 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus

4498735 the road winds there in steep and narrow hairpin turns with a perpendicular cliff on one side and an abyss on the other the ice covered route is terrible and the thousands of trucks which cross the pass every day polish it to a mirror like shine you crawl along at a snails pace all the time

4498742 i am afraid that a lot of people who make games for girls emphasize the wrong part of that sentence for girls and leave the games part out a little bit
4498743 i think what were trying to do is make solid games with strong fun and well developed gameplay rather than a smorgasboard or smaller lesser developed game elements just making a game pink doesnt make it for girls
4498744 not only will you be dressing up people specifically for cliquey boyfriends
4498745 but there are going to be events for each of these different dates so were trying to echo the movie in the framework of the shopping fashion and dress up aspect
4498746 what im trying to do with these is to customize the gameplay to what i think the people who love the movie would be interested in but still use gameplay that will appeal to everyone ultimately we wanted to come up with a solid style of gameplay thats fun fun above everything

4498760 el presidente lugo no sab a de mi decisi n de apoyar la protesta contra la presencia del presidente ortega esto yo le hice en mi car cter personal como defensora de los derechos de la mujer y como luchadora de todas las formas de abuso en contra de la mujer ya sean f sicas psicol gicas y sexuales
4498761 porque yo le creo a zoilam rica narv ez una no va a exponerse p blicamente de esa forma ya casada con su esposo con sus hijos por algo que no sea cierto que sea mentira no es f cil para una mujer decir esas cosas tan dolorosas yo le creo porque soy mujer tambi n y porque respeto su valent a en denunciar algo tan duro como lo que le ha pasado
4498762 no creo porque el presidente lugo conoce muy bien mis posturas sobre los derechos de la mujer cuando me eligi para honrarme con el cargo que me propuso le comuniqu claramente que yo mantendr a mi compromiso de lucha por los derechos de la mujer durante todo el tiempo l me dijo que yo ten a las manos libres para poder defender mis principios y creencias
4498763 yo no soy juez ni abogada para pronunciarme sobre la decisi n de la justicia nicarag ense pero hay una denuncia ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos en costa rica y yo creo que la justicia tanto en costa rica como en nicaragua tiene que hacerse eco del caso de zoilam rica y que finalmente se haga justicia para ella
4498764 el presidente lugo no sab a de mi decisi n de apoyar la protesta contra la presencia del presidente ortega
4498765 yo le creo a zoilam rica narv ez una no va a exponerse p blicamente de esa forma ya casada con su esposo con sus hijos por algo que no sea cierto que sea mentira

4498769 ese es el d a de la virgen de la asunci n y creo que lo est haciendo ese d a para pedir a la madre a la virgen mar a que bendiga ese proyecto ese proceso que tienen que conducir con muchas dificultades vi ndolo tambi n como un proceso de liberaci n nacional para ir recuperando la dignidad de su pueblo
4498770 es un acto de cobard a del presidente daniel ortega el no querer dar la cara porque l siempre se ha escudado en otros incluso en su propia esposa rosario murillo para no responder a los se alamientos que se le hacen
4498771 daniel ortega nunca va a ser capaz de exponerse ante un repudio internacional por eso cancel su asistencia a esa toma de posesi n
4498772 el presidente daniel ortega por miop a torpeza y otras razones se ha vuelto el enemigo n mero uno de los movimientos feministas en todo el mundo
4498773 su posici n en el tema del aborto terap utico es digna de una derecha reaccionaria que solamente george bush es capaz de tener

4498801 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4498802 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4498803 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4498807 i was quite hard on myself i was putting myself in a little bit of solitary confinement but the lads were fantastic
4498808 they came round in the changing room and some of them made a few jokes which sort of breaks the mood even if it is a bit harsh
4498809 i dont know if you could see the jubilation which went through me after i had scored but it was quite a nice feeling

4498816 solar power plants could supply 69 percent of the u s s electricity and 35 percent of its total energy by 2050
4498817 to offset almost all of the projected new demand for electricity in 2030 and largely negate the need for new coal fired power plants
4498818 there is little direct knowledge regarding the petroleum geology of the anwr region
4498819 treats a probabilistic geological abstraction as if it had concrete or material existence
4498820 there is up to 15 billion barrels of recoverable oil reserves lie beneath the chukchi sea
4498821 the usgs oil resource estimates are based largely on the oil productivity of geologic formations that exist in the neighboring state lands and which continue into anwr
4498822 detailed document obtained from a person with access to saudi oil officials
4498823 our findings highlight again the need for sustained and indeed increased investment both upstream and downstream to assure that the market is adequately supplied
4498824 by about half a million barrels per day in july an increase which could bring saudi output to a production level of 10 million barrels a day which if sustained would be the kingdoms highest ever
4498825 they will respond positively whenever there is a request from their customers so there is no shortage
4498826 they the saudis can offer all the oil they want the fact is they want too much for it theres cheaper oil out there right now
4498827 as we look ahead to this week all eyes will be on sundays oil price summit in jeddah

4498833 to review whether classification of these types of traders can be improved for regulatory and reporting purposes
4498834 i remain concerned that the commissions assertions to date discounting the potential role of speculation in driving up oil prices have been based on a glaringly incomplete set of data
4498835 classify ing so called swaps dealers including large investment banks as commercial market participants alongside physical hedgers such as oil companies and airlines rather than as non commercial participants
4498836 even u s fully regulated exchanges nymex are not applying traditional speculation limits to the transactions engaged in by these speculative interests
4498837 the bulbous root is the only commodity for which futures trading is banned
4498838 have reinforced academics belief that futures trading diminishes extreme price swings
4498839 given current market conditions it appears that world oil prices are on a path that more closely resembles the projection in the high price case than in the reference case
4498840 a higher relative price of oil should weaken a countrys real exchange rate if it worsens the countrys terms of trade
4498841 exchange rate movements accounted for roughly a third of the 60 increase in oil prices from 2003 to 2007
4498842 it is estimated that this land could yield an additional 4 8 million barrels of oil each day which would nearly double the u s s oil production
4498843 the fact is 80 percent of the oil available on the outer continental shelf is in regions that are already open to leasing but the oil companies havent decided its worth their time to drill there

4498857 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4498858 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4498859 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4498860 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4498861 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4498862 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4498863 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4498864 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4498865 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4498866 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4498867 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4498868 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4498869 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

4498871 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4498872 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4498873 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4498874 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4498875 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4498876 we do not compete on price or promotion regardless of macroeconomic conditions although it may be both easy and tempting to drive short term sales with pricing and promotional efforts
4498877 we will not sacrifice this investment and growth plan for short term results
4498878 we see further aspirational positioning of the abercrombie brands despite weak retail sales trends and expect this brand strategy to pay back in second half
4498879 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4498898 i am very much aware that france is often seen as the last reservoir of bureaucrats in the world i realize that my country is seen as an odd animal able to call a gigantic strike at any moment for obscure reasons the huge strikes last year organized to prevent young employees from being fired with no explanation puzzles a lot of people many take the view that the french denial of work flexibility is just a refusal to face reality the truth is very different the fact is the rest of the world is jealous of france
4498899 the next challenge will be to introduce new ideas to the doctrine of the left in france as elsewhere

4498913 bev asked me what that siren was for and i told her if we were in the midwest that would mean a tornado was coming
4498914 so bev ran down to the corner of 4th street and palm avenue to take a look ran back and told me to get my camera you could see it coming as we headed toward gilchrist and when we got there it was almost directly over us it was just a bunch of rain then the spout had dissipated but it was amazing i never saw one that close
4498915 the two small ones looked like they traveled quite a ways in the harbor
4498916 the big one as soon as it hit land you could see it shrivel right back up into the sky
4498917 everything was blowing like 50 miles per hour out of nowhere for a minute and half then it was dead still i yelled for dave my husband because i knew what it was
4498918 the spout was directly west of the marina i watched it for over one minute
4498919 it was very close it seemed like it was just on the beach i am glad i had my camera
4498920 one of the guys looked up and said that ill bet that one turns into a tornado and sure enough it did
4498921 we got on the trucks and went out toward the beach while chief contacted noaa and told them to send a broadcast out
4498922 we basically got on the beach at the boca grande club beach house then went down 2nd street 3rd street and moved around all over the place to find the best sight
4498923 then we headed up 5th street 6th street 7th street and 8th street with lights and sirens on to let people know there was something going on
4498924 it came right over the top of us but it was just a little bit of wind
4498925 it broke up by the time it got to 10th and gasparilla and when it came ashore it went right at me the next thing i knew i was in a windfield but it wasnt even as bad as a good thunderstorm more like a typical afternoon rain
4498926 we looked at the charlotte county side and saw something that looked like a definite waterspout there too
4498927 we called and warned pine island units there was tornadic activity heading their way
4498928 we used to sound it every thursday as a nostalgic type thing
4498929 we just sounded it saturday when the funnel cloud was spotted to try and let people know we have no island wide notification system though

4498940 dan bergaullah dengan mereka secara patut kemudian bila kamu tidak menyukai mereka maka bersabarlah karena mungkin kamu tidak menyukai sesuatu padahal allah menjadikan padanya kebaikan yang banyak
4498941 janganlah seorang mukmin membenci seorang mukminah kalaupun dia tidak menyukai suatu akhlaknya yang buruk mungkin di sisi lain ada akhlaknya yang dia senangi

4498999 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4499000 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4499001 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4499002 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide

4499008 basically we are simplifying and coalescing our efforts around atom as the single brand for internet devices
4499009 back when we launched tekzilla a few fans accused us of ripping off hak5s brick encrusted set the correlation was spurious but rather than alienate the industrys top hackers we decided it would be better to team up with hak5 instead
4499010 seriously its great to have such a hardcore hacking show round out our coverage for tech fanatics everywhere and given the street cred of the hak5 team id rather have them with us than against us

4499019 desert jewels north african jewelry and photography from the xavier guerrand herm s collection
4499020 the xavier guerrand herm s collection is remarkable for its breadth
4499021 each piece of jewelry each photograph provides a rare opportunity to view works and images of cultures mostly unfamiliar to american audiences
4499022 from simple ornaments that would be worn by a child to elaborate jeweled necklaces for women of wealth the xavier guerrand herm s collection is a treasure that reflects the richness of the cultures of north africa as well as the collectors superlative taste
4499023 merrill lynch is thrilled to partner with the national museum of african art in washington d c and the museum for african art in new york to bring these never before displayed pieces and photographs to the viewing public
4499024 we truly recognize the importance of investing in the preservation and development of cultural and educational programming in the communities where we work and live
4499025 it is possible that some unknown environmental factor is the cause of current health problems and of gulf war syndrome
4499026 but it is also possible that these symptoms result from the stress of military deployment especially prolonged and multiple deployments
4499027 women now comprise approximately 15 percent of our nations armed forces
4499028 and since the persian gulf war combat roles for women have expanded substantially this study is an attempt to understand the impact of deployment and war related stressors on the health of military women
4499029 by identifying problems early i hope our findings will guide policy makers and health care professions to design interventions to support service members and their families
4499030 the fact that we saw this abnormal difference in gene expression in at least 10 percent of the colon cancer patients and in very few people without colon cancer strongly suggests that it plays an important role in this disease
4499031 moreover if this difference is found in patients with colon cancer it should prompt a study of other family members who as determined by genetic counseling are likely to have also inherited the trait
4499032 it is likely that testing for this abnormal expression will eventually become part of clinical practice when evaluating a patients colon cancer risk
4499033 we and others must now determine the molecular cause of the difference so that we can begin to design ways to correct it and perhaps eliminate the elevated risk of cancer

4499039 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4499040 when looking for jobs school leavers and young job seekers should be realistic and cautious they should beware of dubious recruitment advertisements especially for highly paid positions requiring barely any skills or academic qualifications
4499041 they should also pay attention to the major provisions of the employment ordinance to avoid being owed wages by employers and unnecessary labour disputes
4499042 before signing an employment contract they should make sure they understand and accept all the terms in the contract if the employer proposes to vary the terms of employment or work nature after a contract is signed they should obtain detailed information about these changes before considering whether to accept them
4499043 job seekers should also beware of the situation that swindlers under the pretext of recruitment may obtain from them personal data such as information on bank accounts and credit cards for unlawful purposes
4499044 if they have any doubts or problems they should immediately consult their parents or teachers or seek assistance from appropriate authorities such as the police and the consumer council
4499045 they should carefully assess their own capabilities before taking up a job and pay close attention to the work environment to identify possible hazards
4499046 they should follow the safety guidelines provided by their employers to prevent work injuries
4499047 those who work in catering establishments should exercise extra care to avoid work injuries as they may be required to work on a slippery floor use sharp knives or come into contact with hot cooking equipment
4499048 potentially hazardous jobs such as those involving the operation of woodworking and dangerous machinery or the handling of chemicals may not be suitable for school leavers or young job seekers who are inexperienced and have not received proper training

4499069 siempre he dicho que a unos juegos ol mpicos no se viene para adquirir experiencia sino para lograr resultados y hasta el momento el equipo ha respondido de forma maravillosa

4499137 yesterday afternoon nigerian foreign minister wachuku has expressed to our ambassador usa in lagos his view that if death penalty should be imposed and carried out on mandela and other defendants in rivonia sabotage trial it would place moderate african leaders like himself and government of nigeria who are attempting to follow a reasonable course on the south african problem in an impossible situation jooste took careful notes his reaction to wachukus statement was calm satterthwaite

4499140 coming back to south africa i have been suprised to discover a generosity of spirit that survived the atrocities of apartheid it is a humanism expressed in the distinctly african notion that people are people through other people this sense of community and sharing is not without the usual frailties but the evidence of its resilence is everywhere in this country and this film has been a tribute to that vibrant quality but tributes are not enough it was the ordinary people of south africa who set the pace of change it was their humanity and their courage that triumphed here proving that fundamental change is possible it will be a tragedy for all of us if their continuing struggle goes unrewarded for its inspiration and lessons are universal

4499167 for a country like georgia what they are trying to do essentially is get meetings to get noticed to further their goals what randy scheunemann was essentially trying to do is build relationships between key decision makers in the white house and in congress to sell the notion that this is a vital democracy

4499184 belgi had de wedstrijd zeker onder controle maar door 2 individuele fouten zijn de nieuw zeelanders op voorsprong kunnen komen het was vandaag van de belgen zeker niet dezelfde prestatie als die tegen duitsland vooral wat betreft de coherentie van het spel op het einde hebben ze nog gevochten maar het is natuurlijk niet evident om zon achterstand goed te maken
4499185 fysiek was het zeer zwaar het was redelijk warm en de nieuw zeelanders gaan er altijd met kop en schouders voor dat hebben we vooral gemerkt in de defensieve cirkel zij zijn heel opportunistisch geweest de eerste 20 minuten waren voor ons eigenlijk ze konden ons niet onder druk zetten en wij speelden de bal mooi rond maar dan scoren ze door individuele fouten van ons en dan ga je met 3 0 de kleedkamer in
4499186 tijdens de rust hebben we ons dan wel opgepept om er te blijven voor gaan maar het is natuurlijk heel zwaar om zon achterstand goed te maken vooral bij deze omstandigheden de tweede helft hebben we nog veel druk op hen gezet en waren we sterker maar dat was niet voldoende dit is een grote ontgoocheling natuurlijk want we zagen nog kans om de top 2 te halen we gaan wel nog blijven vechten om in de komende wedstrijden een goed resultaat te halen
4499187 mijn eerste objectief was dat van rie me niet mocht inlopen bij het keerpunt zag ik echter dat het goed zat en dat ik op weg was naar een mooie prestatie maar aan de titel heb ik nooit gedacht daarvoor was het verschil met an vorig jaar te groot

4499296 how about this before the qualifying tournaments for the 2012 olympics corral a mix of solid ex college basketball players and recently retired nbaers ideally youd get current nba players but qualifiers would happen during the nba season so they wouldnt be able to break free
4499297 put the college players and pro retirees in a camp for a month
4499298 once the u s is the olympics take that group of nba players whove always wanted to be olympians put them in a summer camp before the games and bang you have a medal contender for an olympic medal you need the absolute best pros possible
4499299 thats ridiculous you say what sports executive would let a multi million dollar investment play some silly sport in the off season well if basketball general managers let their guys play olympic basketball in the summer and hockey bosses permit their stars to play in the olympic tournament during the season why wouldnt they let them hurl the handball theyre much less likely to get hurt in a sport that every kid in gym class can play plus itll keep them from crashing motorcycles during the off season
4499300 and what happens to those poor guys who qualified for the olympics if they know theyre not going to play in the olympics why play hard in qualifying well we never said the u s should publicize this plan cruel sure but this is an arms race plus have you seen those chinese sports schools next to them this strategy is saintly
4499301 but thats just the quick fix for 2012 anything is better than what the u s has now around say 2011 find a group of committed athletes who have no options in other pro sports house them in the usocs colorado springs training center for weeks at a time and start shooting for 2016 give them stipends offer them the olympic dream the usoc does this in minor sports like wrestling and rowing why not do it for handball
4499302 if funding is a problem steal money from the budget of insane sports well never be good at modern pentathlon ski jumping biathlon whats the point its so much simpler for americans to throw a little ball around than shoot stuff after skiing cede that to the nords
4499303 look at baseball basketball american football the u s knows how to build a sport
4499304 it was always my fathers dream to have handball become big in the u s
4499305 maybe ill become a trainer in the u s one day

4499433 ever more frequently appear in the role of directors of reality
4499434 the way in which leading television channels in russia have covered military actions in south ossetia recalls the work of tv journalists during the second chechen campaign and the seizure of the school in beslan

4499441 it is curious that south ossetia which is one of the world leaders in the production of counterfeit dollars with a great deal of humor deals with the fact of the production of false russian passports in the republic
4499442 the entire caucasus world laughed over the reliable but humorous report of an unknown ossetin author in which president kokoita having received freshly printed passport number 2 number one was sent as a gift to putin found instead of his own photograph a portrait of abraham lincoln taken from a one hundred dollar bill

4499550 with so much talk of the devastating impact the credit crunch is having on uk business these findings are encouraging
4499551 it indicates that uk senior management have confidence that their organisations will not only ride out the credit crunch but will perform from it
4499552 there is no denying that the credit crunch is being felt by businesses throughout the uk
4499553 however organisations can survive it and can even take advantage of it as long as they have the right strategies processes and systems in place
4499554 the bottom line is that there is always money to be made even during a credit crunch

4499580 gold production is stagnating and output in the leading gold producing countries continues to fall year on year despite higher gold prices leading geologists to wonder whether we may have or may soon have reached the point of peak gold production the worlds biggest producer south africa produced nearly 1000 tonnes of gold in 1980 this was down to 264 tonnes last year the lowest since 1932
4499581 the china gold association announced that chinas gold output was expected to reach 300 tons in 2008 surpassing that of south africa and making china the worlds largest gold producer
4499582 surpassed the united states as the worlds second largest gold producer in 2007 with 270 491 tons of output

4499584 the long term average gold to oil ratio is 15 to 1 or 15 barrels of oil to one ounce of gold
4499585 gold has traded at over 30 times a barrel of oil
4499586 should there be a classic reversion to the mean average of 4 4 in the ratio of ounces of silver per barrel of oil then silver prices would rise to 30 per ounce and silver is selling at less than half that price right now

4499589 we are absolutely committed to electing barack obama and this is the best way to do it so let people have their moment
4499590 sen clinton will assure that nothing will occur that will hinder sen obama s chances but even more will help him by when it comes time for her vote by voting for him and by moving at the convention to nominate sen obama by acclamation
4499591 its a free country and some of the more passionate and less say constructive of her supporters are a very very small minority might try to do something like that
4499592 no one can be associated with more loyalty and dedication than i towards sen clinton and i will and many of us will be very critical of anybody on the convention floor to do anything that undermines sen obama
4499593 if that happened if someone who hogs the microphone or tries to demagogue or tries to be negative there will no sympathy from hillary clinton or loyalists such as myself

4499658 australia has one of the safest aviation systems in the world
4499659 we know we dont have a systemic problem with maintenance and safety but some of the stuff were seeing published is pretty crazy
4499660 the cost pressures in every legacy carrier are just as intense as in qantas
4499661 all well established carriers have therefore increased the risk levels associated with maintenance throughout the world over the last decade
4499662 given that qantas had a leading position 10 years as the worlds safest then in all honesty it is probably still there
4499663 whats playing out is the tension of outsourcing everything and the timely and quality maintenance that was traditionally done by airlines
4499664 it just means that someone didnt lock it down properly before take off
4499665 legally qantas did not have to replace it and they could have flown on without a problem
4499666 a lot of these things are found when planes are on the ground and thats what the inspections are there for
4499667 you dont allow cancer to grow you cut it out before it kills you pray to god they are defeated by the ballot which will make the bullet unnecessary
4499668 if you look at all the factors that have challenged the automotive industry over the past 10 years youd have to say that tariff reduction was not one of the most weighty issues
4499669 exchange rate issues worldwide competition the open market we have here weigh much more heavily
4499670 the review is wide ranging and makes a number of significant recommendations
4499671 the continuation of a competitive investment scheme is a positive step as is further clarification of the green car fund
4499672 however the decline in tariffs from 10 per cent to 5 per cent in 2010 is a concern for the industrys ability to compete on a global scale
4499673 we need to look at it on a level playing field
4499674 brazil runs a 35 per cent tariff and china is 25 per cent
4499675 australia at 10 per cent makes it tougher for local manufacturers in competing and drawing innovation and new technology into australia so it is more of a challenge for us here
4499676 there are other countries out there that value their auto industry greatly their tariffs reflect that
4499677 so the tariff piece of this report is something were going to have to discuss and analyse
4499678 it is going to have an impact here on what money we feed back into the economy
4499679 it certainly has a short term effect on how we re invest our money here
4499680 if we have to spend money to price compete with some of the people that bring products at very low cost into this country it diverts some of our re investment opportunity for the future

4499700 new kim porter reality show to feature 3 brown girls
4499701 but it is important yet again to call out the endless neoconservative search for new enemies mini hitlers
4499702 it is the product of an abstract over intellectualizing of the world the classic defect of ideologues it is as we have seen the last eight years a dangerous way to behave internationally and it has severely damaged our moral authority in the world i mean after the u s invasion of iraq after abu ghraib after our blithe rubbishing of the geneva accords why should anyone listen to us when we criticize the russians for their aggression in the caucasus
4499703 do you recall the precise details of the sudeten crisis that led to nazi germanys invasion of czechoslovakia of course not because that morally ambiguous dispute is rightly remembered as a minor part of a much bigger drama
4499704 the mood is reminiscent of germany after world war i when germans complained about the shameful versailles diktat imposed on a prostrate germany by the victorious powers and about the corrupt politicians who stabbed the nation in the back
4499705 but georgia a nation of about 4 6 million has had the third largest military presence about 2 000 troops fighting along with u s soldiers and marines in iraq for this reason alone we owe georgia a serious effort to defend its sovereignty
4499706 surely we cannot simply stand by as an autocratic aggressor gobbles up part of and perhaps destabilizes all of a friendly democratic nation that we were sponsoring for nato membership a few months ago
4499707 when the civilized world expostulated with russia about georgia in 1924 the soviet regime was still weak in germany hitler was in jail only 16 years later britain stood virtually alone against a nazi soviet axis is it not true today as it was in the 1920s and 30s that delay and irresolution on the part of the democracies simply invite future threats and graver dangers
4499708 it is in americas interest to exert maximum pressure on russia to withdraw its troops and halt the interference in georgian territory this latest act shows the need for greater resolve in establishing a european security system that can be an effective check on russian power
4499709 whats the difference between this and the annexation of the sudetenland including the paralysis of the so called western world in the face of deliberate systematic military conquest
4499710 the silence of the left is notable since they so often pose as defenders of peace once again it turns out that american military action is judged evil while our enemies can do the same without a word of protest wheres code pink wheres ron paul for that matter

4499724 oh no no no no i think youre ignoring the more obvious issues as well as projecting your feelings on to others
4499725 i feel like weve had a real breakthrough here today whiskey by admitting that youre a coo koo nutso whack job youve taken the first step i think that many many years of invasive and intrusive psychotherapy coupled with high doses of lithium and vodka should at least get you to the point where youll stop seeing imaginary serial killers but unfortunately youll still never leave your house in your condition that would be a terrible idea

4499736 theres a lot of challenging things in text messaging and the way kids kind of communicate outside of school
4499737 but one of the basics is that we want them to be able to tell the stories of their lives and we want them to do it conventionally as well as in the texting world we want them to realize the little things they do every day really make important and great stories that they should be sharing with their friends family and teachers
4499738 i think their classrooms are going to be very active during writers workshop
4499739 i also think they are going to be very much more aware of kids as individuals as writers

4499763 youd think that with young players like anderson ronaldo wayne rooney nani there will be improvement there

4499765 wayne is fit and the good thing he has done very well this week and has been progressing really well
4499766 we had quite a few opportunities last week that has to be said
4499767 we would have liked to have taken them and put the game to bed and if you dont take these chances in games that are close you can regret it
4499768 fortunately last week we were in control of the situation when it went to penalty kicks but we never looked as though we were going to lose it
4499769 but we have a good variety of midfield players and the back four are fit so we have a good foundation if we keep creating chances then we will start taking them

4499775 he plays very well at any club in the world and is a fantastic player but i am happy with my players in chelsea if i lose against portsmouth on sunday it is not because robinho isnt here it is because we didnt play very well i have players here to win all the games or to lose all the games

4499779 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
4499780 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
4499781 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
4499782 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies

4499825 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4499826 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4499827 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4499829 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4499830 belgi had de wedstrijd zeker onder controle maar door 2 individuele fouten zijn de nieuw zeelanders op voorsprong kunnen komen het was vandaag van de belgen zeker niet dezelfde prestatie als die tegen duitsland vooral wat betreft de coherentie van het spel op het einde hebben ze nog gevochten maar het is natuurlijk niet evident om zon achterstand goed te maken
4499831 fysiek was het zeer zwaar het was redelijk warm en de nieuw zeelanders gaan er altijd met kop en schouders voor dat hebben we vooral gemerkt in de defensieve cirkel zij zijn heel opportunistisch geweest de eerste 20 minuten waren voor ons eigenlijk ze konden ons niet onder druk zetten en wij speelden de bal mooi rond maar dan scoren ze door individuele fouten van ons en dan ga je met 3 0 de kleedkamer in
4499832 tijdens de rust hebben we ons dan wel opgepept om er te blijven voor gaan maar het is natuurlijk heel zwaar om zon achterstand goed te maken vooral bij deze omstandigheden de tweede helft hebben we nog veel druk op hen gezet en waren we sterker maar dat was niet voldoende dit is een grote ontgoocheling natuurlijk want we zagen nog kans om de top 2 te halen we gaan wel nog blijven vechten om in de komende wedstrijden een goed resultaat te halen

4499848 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4499849 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4499850 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4499851 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4499852 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4499853 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4499854 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4499855 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4499856 once they issue impeachment proceedings against him and issue a charge sheet then it will become almost inevitable that he will want to answer those charges
4499857 he feels very strongly that a lot of that is being said is not correct
4499858 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit
4499859 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him

4499926 as an ethical requirement for organ donation the dead donor rule has required unnecessary and unsupportable revisions of the definition of death
4499927 the uncomfortable conclusion to be drawn from this literature is that although it may be perfectly ethical to remove vital organs for transplantation from patients who satisfy the diagnostic criteria of brain death the reason it is ethical cannot be that we are convinced they are really dead
