9080005 i want to start today by congratulating senator obama and senator biden on their nominations and we look forward to a robust campaign
9080006 just because hes not ready to be president doesnt mean we wont see a lot of glitz and glamour tonight
9080007 we already know hes a rock star and can bring 85 000 people to the stadium but what happens about the shows over
9080008 our question for obama is what have you done and what have you run
9080009 youre going to see a lot of people who are extremely skeptical it would seem that you would need a little more time
9080010 a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs

9080018 right now it looks like malaysia is heading to what could turn out to be an embarrassing situation
9080019 we only have 10 months to build new stadiums and source for at least rm2 million to cover organising costs
9080020 the mhf at present is still paying the rm1 million debt incurred after organising the champions trophy last december and is in no position to fall again
9080021 i feel really bad about what happened and want to make amends
9080022 all i can say is that such talk is rubbish
9080023 but i can confirm that a state assemblyman was there
9080024 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9080025 we send our congratulations to governor palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president her selection is yet another encouraging sign that all barriers are falling in our politics and while we obviously have differences over how to best lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9080026 i know a couple of english words but i dont think i should say them out loud because players are usually yellow carded for them the club promised to provide an interpreter for me and ill start learning the language i just have to
9080027 it was one of those rare days with my putter i hadnt had in a while everything seemed to look easier
9080028 i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another one on the second and then had about maybe eight feet on the third i holed another 10 footer on four
9080029 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9080030 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9080031 its been kind of my goal the last moth or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9080032 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations
9080033 its nuts i dont think theyve got it right quite yet
9080034 how can you have a double major winner not make the tour championship thats complete nonsense
9080035 it was one of the rare days it did feel like that
9080036 but it was one of those days with my putter i hadnt had in a while so it was fun
9080037 i just dont feel any pressure out there at the moment

9080040 i was never really in danger so it was actually pretty good for me
9080041 i knew the longer the match would go the more tired he would get
9080042 i was struggling to see the ball at the net a little bit with the crowd in the back
9080043 in the second set when it got tough he dug out some shots and everything seemed to go against me
9080044 the competing views of success in our world often create an interesting tension society tends to define success in terms of accomplishments and awards material possessions and profit margins in the football business winning is the only thing that matters
9080045 this book is an excellent learning tool like any other tool you get out of it exactly what you put in my advice is to spend as much time with each section as you need if you do that you will walk away with every bit of the knowledge an industry thought leader can provide

9080047 this is life not heaven you dont have to be perfect
9080048 life and death energy and peace if i stop today it was still worth it even the terrible mistakes that i made and would have unmade if i could the pains that have burned me and scarred my soul it was worth it for having been allowed to walk where ive walked which was to hell on earth heaven on earth back again into under far in between through it in it and above

9080052 the second leg will be away they beat barcelona the other night
9080053 they are very passionate fans so we will have to do very well at home to start with
9080054 the draw is the draw theres nothing to do about it
9080055 even after seeing the teams we will play you dont know if it will be an easy or difficult first phase
9080056 our first objective is to get to the next phase the second is to try to do so as group b winners
9080057 of course were really motivated and confident we want to start playing the champions league as soon as possible
9080058 for us its great to be welcomed back to the champions league with a classic encounter against real madrid
9080059 but theres also zenit who represent the progression of east european teams our players need to remember that theyre playing at the highest level and that juve are back
9080060 it seems like a good group to me certainly an interesting one
9080061 i believe i have a 50 50 chance of beating julia
9080062 i did well i had to come back in third set from down 3 0 in games so i am happy with the victory
9080063 not too many long rallies but i am serving well
9080064 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
9080065 i have no reason to be here other than to be a part of history
9080066 when i realised it was on that anniversary it just felt like fate i had to be there
9080067 this is one of the greatest experiences of my life
9080068 this makes me feel very lucky to be an american
9080069 i vividly remember watching and i vividly remember not being able to go

9080072 teach both you know dont be afraid of education healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9080073 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class
9080074 im not going to pretend i know how all this came to be
9080075 its unfortunate mccain would pick someone who shares those particular anti science views but its not a surprise
9080076 shes a choice that pleases the religious right and the religious right has been the chief force against teaching evolution
9080077 in the direct sense vice presidents dont have much to do with what goes on in classrooms but a person whos a creationist doesnt understand science and technology at all
9080078 it doesnt bode well for science and doesnt bode well for interaction between science and government
9080079 i think its a mistake to try to cloud the teachings of science with theories that frankly dont hold up to scientific inquiry
9080080 great she will know that we are playing and will maybe understand that i do love bobby and spend time with him
9080081 do the people laugh when you say what you say
9080082 well tell bill i said have a coke and a smile and shut the f k up
9080083 i take the occasion to say bye to all the fans who have always been close to me in the nice and bad moments
9080084 im temporarily leaving the team i had always dreamed of playing for and which gave me the possibility to win the most important trophies
9080085 i looked at the fixtures and noticed straight away that west ham away was the third game in
9080086 the trip to upton park was the one that stood out to me for some reason i cant think why not long ago i was looking at the fixtures and thinking about darlington and rochdale no disrespect to them
9080087 now here i am looking at when we are going to be playing against manchester united and chelsea and west ham of course
9080088 lyon will be a hurdle to overcome fiorentina has its attraction because of luca toni formerly of fiorentina it will no doubt be a very exciting affair
9080089 against portsmouth i think everyone sat up and took notice of that and wigan was one where we had to dig in a bit more against a very physical team who i think will cause a lot of problems for teams at home this year
9080090 i think its important to take a lot from both games not every game in the premier league is easy to play great flowing football in
9080091 against portsmouth he scored a great goal and then the freekick he hit the other day at wigan was a match winning moment its what you want players like him in your team for i expect more of the same from him
9080092 you can never say that you are a first choice at this football club
9080093 if you start to think like that then you can just about guarantee that you are about to lose your place
9080094 its a big fight to get into the team its a bigger fight to stay there
9080095 of course we have to win things that is the main objective to win something this year
9080096 but if we can do it the way we play it is even better because football is to entertain people and to take pleasure and thats what we are doing at arsenal
9080097 it is unlikely that we will see another olympics of this scope and nature again
9080098 the largest urban park created in europe for more than 150 years
9080099 we showed some very positive signs especially in the second set
9080100 in the first set we came out a little scared but i think we overcame those first game jitters and played with a lot more poise in the last two sets
9080101 you can get all if this from mark i will let this all play out through the legal system
9080102 he was taken off the ventilator at 11 45 p m
9080103 the video portrays the progression of chris martin regaining the function of his lungs
9080104 it isnt unusual for such masks to be on only when a patient is sleeping when he was awake particularly to eat he would have had a nasal cannula on for oxygen rather than a bipap or mask or nothing to assist his breathing at all if his oxygen level held out while he was awake and alert and he would have been sitting up or moving around it is entirely possible he could have been talking on his cell phone on the 23rd and 24th or the same days these last 2 clips were taken there are no clips on the 21st or 22nd so it may have even been possible then there is no ng tube in the last 2 clips so i am going to assume that the child could have been eating food by then and so was at times awake and without a mask just because he is asleep and breathing noisily doesnt mean he was not awake and breathing quietly at other times of those days or able to talk on a cell phone
9080105 if the case is that the clips were merely taken during sleep moments and the child also had waking moments without masks on those days the video is misleading and making the most of dramatizing the case
9080106 i take the occasion to say bye to all the fans who have always been close to me in the nice and bad moments
9080107 im temporarily leaving the team i had always dreamed of playing for and which gave me the possibility to win the most important trophies

9080109 good bye from a good milan friend midfielder christian brocchi
9080110 it was a difficult choice but i think that its fair
9080111 i take the occasion to say bye to all the fans who have always been close to me in the nice and bad moments to say bye to the milan club who for over twenty years taught me how to live play and made me an important player thank you all

9080118 were going by witness accounts that the cars were racing
9080119 and once in a while like in the incident last night we suspect maybe the individuals just started racing each other but theres nothing to make us believe this was a planned race
9080120 i dont think so especially because her sister was going to give birth next month
9080121 i dont think it was racing if anything it was the other two cars and they got in the middle of it

9080131 we employ different levels of strength when we massage soft medium or deep
9080132 soft is used when the masseur is getting to know your body once we have identified your problem area we will apply the deep massage where we use more strength you will feel some pain at this time
9080133 thats why it is best to go for packages because the first session is for you to relax and for us to get to know your body the second is when you start feeling the effects of the massage and the third is for remedial massage when we spend more time on the problem areas
9080134 we are located on the same level as a spa when couples get here the woman goes to the spa while the man may prefer to come here

9080138 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9080139 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil

9080163 y por eso toda comunidad cristiana debe tomar estos valores y aplicarlos en sus programas pastorales
9080164 la iglesia existiendo en el mundo y por el mundo si bien no es del mundo no puede olvidar su misi n de testimoniar la vida cristiana en el mundo
9080165 cuando la iglesia se interesa en la promoci n humana cuando proclama normas para una nueva coexistencia en paz y justicia cuando obra con todas las personas de buena voluntad para crear relaciones e instituciones que sean m s humanas

9080203 but you were formerly spiritual living the eternal life and immortal for all generations of the world and therefore i have not appointed wives for you for as for the spiritual ones of the heaven in heaven is their dwelling and now the giants who are produced from the spirits and flesh shall be called evil spirits upon the earth and on the earth shall be their dwelling evil spirits have proceeded from their bodies because they are born from men and from the holy watchers is their beginning and primal origin they shall be evil spirits upon earth and evil spirits shall they be called and the spirits of the giants afflict oppress destroy attack do battle and work destruction on the earth and cause trouble they take no food but nevertheless hunger and thirst and cause offenses and these spirits shall rise up against the children of men and against the women because they have proceeded from them from the days of the slaughter and destruction and death of the giants from the souls of whose flesh the spirits having gone forth shall destroy without incurring judgement thus shall they destroy until the day of the consummation the great judgement in which the age shall be consummated over the watchers and the godless yea shall be wholly consummated

9080208 mr smurf our records indicate that a letter with further instructions to cancel mortgage insurance was mailed to you on august 27 and you should be receiving it within 7 10 days
9080209 i know what it says and thats not what im calling about see lisa said that she had emailed the mi deletion department and that shed likely have a response for me today
9080210 im not sure why she would have emailed them ill transfer you please hold
9080211 the law is pretty clear the loan to value is supposed to be based on the original property value at the inception of the contract you just said that my loan to value percentage was at 77 percent that number would be based on my original property value which by law means that i shouldnt be paying for pmi anymore
9080212 however um market conditions are such that however landsafe will have to conduct an appraisal but you however shouldnt send the payment along with your regular mortgage payment
9080213 the appraisal is only 130 and with that pmi could be cancelled
9080214 so i could infact have a balance of under one thousand dollars and id still have to pay pmi each month
9080215 due to market conditions however a cov um investors are however at 78 percent um
9080216 so pmi will never be cancelled automatically is that what youre saying
9080217 are there any other concerns i can help you with mr smurf

9080263 since its a 2d fighting game its doable but whether wed try we dont know wed have to see if we can sell it we might consider it and it would be a straight forward street fighter iv it wouldnt be a kids version
9080264 if im still alive in the next three months we can talk

9080289 there are certain issues where i identify more with republicans and other issues where i identify more with democrats so i really am completely undecided at this point
9080290 these voters are starting to become independent swing voters instead of a lock for either party
9080291 for democrats also its a successful place because when a group had been voting four out of five republican and they start becoming a swing constituency that also has significant electoral implications

9080371 the general consensus amongst industry professionals is that a new generation of home consoles will arrive on the market in 2011 or 2012
9080372 is the fact that they dont have a significantly larger storage medium than the previous systems its a slightly bigger dvd disc if were filling up the disc right now where are we going its not like our games are going to get any smaller
9080373 in terms of specific things blu ray hasnt made much difference the original game fits on a 360 disk so it wasnt like we were in need of room
9080374 its not inconceivable that you might have a next gen xbox with a relatively simple cpu
9080375 just a couple of biggish out of order cores and then some larrabee like monster handling graphics physics ai and so on
9080376 as its philosophically similar to larrabee the problem is that the only workload on a console that is currently parallelised is graphics and thats the one thing the cell doesnt do real time physics and complex ai will become more important on consoles as will more programmable graphics ray tracing is one example so highly parallel and programmable larrabee or cell chips look like the way forward
9080377 pretty much no chance of making money on the ps3
9080378 were looking at the last generation of consoles theres not going to be an xbox 720 or a ps4 ill make that bet not going to happen
9080379 people ask me how many people i have working on the next generation on the one hand its everybody on the other its nobody people are continuously working on new technology

9080399 i know of organizations being harassed and people are worried that they are identified as a threat simply because of their religious beliefs or cultural background the government can work to moderate and build trust with the people i have cited organizations such as usaid the national endowment for democracy the international republican institute the national democratic institute the peace corps and various other think tanks that take the more liberal open view without compromising the fundamentals you see there is always this difficulty that one small incident will dismantle the entire fabric of our agreement and this is really difficult for us to accept

9080411 i know governor palin from the national governors conference and shes a very effective leader and shes a reformer and i like her very much because she has the strength to go and push back
9080412 she had the strength to fix the budget problem that they had to reform the system and also to push back really hard on that bridge to nowhere
9080413 and i think shes cleaning up the mess up there and i think she has tremendous courage
9080414 i mean its spectacular because im a big believer that women can do just as great a job if not better job as guys can do
9080415 this pick had nothing to do with being qualified to step into the presidency which sarah palin clearly isnt

9080432 the decision rendered here is confined to the particular combination of facts in this case and is not intended to push the bounds of the safe harbor so wide that less scrupulous service providers may claim its protection
9080433 the plaintiffs in the veoh case never bothered to send a notice of infringing activity to veoh before they filed suit of course once veoh was sued and realized what it was getting in trouble for it took down all the infringing videos so the court was sympathetic that veoh had been taken by surprise
9080434 by contrast viacom doesnt deny that youtube takes down infringing content when it is notified
9080435 whether or not theres a burden shifting is a difficult question to answer

9080445 a power hungry tyrant uses venezuelas oil supply to overthrow the government and turns the country into a war zone
9080446 at the end of the day you have to remind yourself its a damned video game
9080447 the singapore i like to see when i grow up
9080448 now we know what were up against with sen john mccains announcement moments ago that anti choice alaska gov sarah palin is his pick for vice president
9080449 by picking palin we now risk having two anti choice extremists who will push a rigid anti choice agenda
9080450 any remaining doubts about mccains extreme anti choice position should be put to rest when voters learn about the combined anti choice records of palin and mccain
9080451 palin is also a member of the anti choice group feminists for life
9080452 that man has no respect for his rover and beats
9080453 sarah is someone who is in sync with the way real american women think
9080454 see where im pointing is the amount of blood flow to your penis before i walked over here and over here on the right of the graph is the amount of blood flowing to it now
9080455 dude you see that mccain chick i want to hear her talk so it seems more real when i jerk it to her
9080456 john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time
9080457 today as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
9080458 you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances
9080459 so let me spell out exactly what change would mean if i am president
9080460 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
9080461 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9080462 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease
9080463 i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
9080464 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
9080465 hey hey hey can i wok witchu hey can i wok witch uuuuu
9080466 shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs
9080467 shes got guts she got ability shes not afraid to stand up for whats right i think every utahn ought to be exhilarated by the fact that we have a conservative woman
9080468 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hilary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9080469 i was so proud to see our party pick a woman for this position shes all around really an outstanding woman i have to tell you im a tough old bird but i actually got tears in my eyes when he announced her and she started to speak
9080470 i think its really cool he chose a woman especially since hilary didnt get a nomination for her party i just think its good to see a woman running for vice president
9080471 i think as of right now its kind of important i dont think that she has any less of a chance than a man would at this point in our society
9080472 i thought it was a mistake because it makes him look like a hypocrite because hed been bashing obama for his lack of experience and then hires someone whod been a governor for two years of alaska and a mayor of a small town so i think he officially took the experience card off the table
9080473 id love a female vice president i really think this country would do great with a female vice president
9080474 we know that down there childrens books dont really exist so we wanted to make a fun book for them
9080475 he was walking his dog and sugar people come and attack and try to take over the world

9080482 palin clearly sympathizes with clinton but also says that clinton does herself and other women a disservice with the perceived whine about tougher media coverage
9080483 someone should stand up and say i know senator clinton
9080484 i personally believe she is as qualified for the job as obama is
9080485 no more heckuva job brownie incompetence and no more bridges to nowhere
9080486 i know ive said that obama has no experience but i just picked someone that makes him look like john quincy adams
9080487 i dont want to talk about the negative regarding them i want to talk about the positive regarding me

9080492 the 3 2 million members of the national education association are pleasantly surprised by senator john mccains selection of alaska governor sarah palin to join his ticket as the republican nominee for vice president
9080493 while she is only in her second year as alaskas governor she has thus far shown herself to be a supporter of children and public education she comes from a family of educators her father was a teacher her brother is a teacher and her mother was an education support professional
9080494 in her less than two years as the states chief executive officer she was able to increase per pupil education spending
9080495 and she is opposed to sending public money to support private schools through political schemes like vouchers
9080496 her selection however has certainly taken the issue of experience off the table for political debate
9080497 we are concerned over the fate of syrian kurdish activist mashaal tammo whose disturbing arrest is the most recent of a string of detentions of civil society activists by the syrian government
9080498 we condemn the detention of tammo and other syrian prisoners of conscience and call for their immediate and unconditional release by the syrian government
9080499 we encourage the international community to join us in calling on the syrian government to stop its policy of arresting critics of the regime

9080506 yes there will be a new version of psgimp with new style an some new features
9080507 because my primary objective was to secure an nba team in seattle and that objective was not adequately insured by that settlement
9080508 told me he wanted to hear it from the horses mouth why i was not joining in the citys settlement and dismissing my lawsuit
9080509 that if i did not join in the settlement i should realize that it will become very expensive for me and my partners and he implied that i should reconsider my position
9080510 the nba would offer no further assurances in that regard
9080511 we had a friendly conversation at the close of which we both had stated our positions there were no threats expressed or implied

9080524 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term
9080525 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment
9080526 partly to blame for labours woes because they have patently failed to explain the partys central mission to the country
9080527 they took me in arrested me fingerprinted me and read me my rights
9080528 it was absolutely traumatizing your picture is all over the paper there are clouds of doubt you walk through places and people are looking at you

9080544 listing polar bears under the endangered species act has the potential to damage alaskas and the nations economy without any benefit to polar bear numbers or their habitat
9080545 sarah palins chief qualification for being elected governor was that she was not frank murkowski
9080546 she was not elected because she was a conservative she was not elected because of her grasp of issues or because of her track record as the mayor of wasilla
9080547 the middle class proletariat the middle classes could become a revolutionary class taking the role envisaged for the proletariat by marx the globalization of labour markets and reducing levels of national welfare provision and employment could reduce peoples attachment to particular states the growing gap between themselves and a small number of highly visible super rich individuals might fuel disillusion with meritocracy while the growing urban under classes are likely to pose an increasing threat to social order and stability as the burden of acquired debt and the failure of pension provision begins to bite faced by these twin challenges the worlds middle classes might unite using access to knowledge resources and skills to shape transnational processes in their own class interest

9080550 dit civielrechtelijk aanpakken van een groep lijkt voor de hand te liggen maar is tot nu toe nauwelijks gebruikt door de overheid gemeenten en politie hebben daar lange tijd niet bij stilgestaan zegt burgemeester cohen wel dienen overheden soms tijdens de strafzaak een eis tot schadevergoeding in dat biedt echter minder kans op succes meent gemeente advocaat irma van den berg

9080554 oftentimes the chin is an overlooked part of the face and it can make a positive impact both in men and women in how they look
9080555 i was always interested in ceos its been known they tend to be taller than the average population theyre good looking well spoken people and i was curious that they might have stronger chins also
9080556 warren buffett in terms of the business world also john mack and on a softer chin would be bill gates his chin is a little soft but hes a self made man he wasnt hired for the job in terms of stars george clooney arnold schwarzenegger brad pitt they all have strong chins
9080557 and thats not something you can exercise to make bigger you either have it or you dont surgerys the only option if you dont
9080558 to give you a stronger impression and it also increases the distance under the chin to give you a cleaner look and minimize the double chin
9080559 theyre typically in there for life once theyre put in but if for some reason you decided you didnt like it short term after the surgery you could take it out ive rarely had to do that
9080560 ive seen a doubling in the last five years of people having chin implants sometimes itll be done in conjunction with a face lift or liposuction to minimize the double chin
9080561 ive been here for twenty four years and this is the first time this particular bank i believe has been robbed
9080562 some do it for money some do it for kicks some do it for whatever reason they do but its not necessarily tied to the economic trend
9080563 a lot of it has to do with greed with the need for money but it could be based upon the fact they are into drugs or into gangs or into violent crime
9080564 the person who robs multiple banks is a very serious threat because statistics have shown that when people rob banks they become more aggressive they become more violent
9080565 well it works for obama but hes a great orator and im not so im not going to try what obama did
9080566 i am like you i understand where you are coming from
9080567 im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
9080568 i know you are not whiners but thats what mccains campaign thinks of you
9080569 i care about you and i understand you mccain may pretend to care but hes not going to do anything at all to help you out
9080570 if john mccain gave up the health care that he gets from the government paid for by your tax dollars and the socialized medicine he gets as a veteran also paid for by your tax dollars and tried to use the plan he is trying to force on all americans he would have a hard time finding a company to insure him with his pre existing conditions and at his age it would be almost impossible to find any insurance anywhere in america at any price john mccain doesnt even realize this is a problem since he wants to force this on all of us i do see the problem and i promise i will fix it john mccain does not understand how health care operates in america and it would be a disaster to put him in charge of changing it
9080571 so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
9080572 you may not agree with me but here is what i believe and here is something i think we can agree on

9080576 this is a home run she is a reformer governor who is solidly pro life and a person of deep christian faith and she is really one of the bright shining new stars in the republican firmament

9080586 i do not think there is any other quality so essential to success of any kind as the quality of perseverance it overcomes almost everything even nature
9080587 if your determination is fixed i do not counsel you to despair few things are impossible to diligence and skill great works are performed not by strength but perseverance
9080588 if you want to get somewhere you have to know where you want to go and how to get there then never never never give up
9080589 persistence is to the character of man as carbon is to steel
9080590 you never win the silver you always loose the gold
9080591 fire is the test of gold and adversity of man

9080593 one veep candidate is going to be a white guy who makes racially suspect comments and the other is going to be a woman
9080594 how can mccain pick someone who is only a heartbeat away from the presidency with so little experience she has only run the smallest state in the union and a town

9080603 there is now great industry support behind blu ray and the format is moving forward with enhancements that move beyond high definition such as the bd live spec that integrates internet connectivity options with the disc
9080604 the reality is that when you start with standard definition theres only so much you can do to it to make it look better at a higher resolution
9080605 the best upscaling technology in the world cant make average quality standard definition content look like high quality hd content because the content just isnt there

9080607 it becomes a priority at the station thats not measurable in times of mention but it becomes part of the djs patter on the air you cant log that you cant buy that you cant specify that
9080608 we have a station thats new in the area and is competing for market share if i do a copromotion im likely to get up to 50 free mentions in addition to my paid advertising with a station that doesnt have a relationship with the club i may only get a one to one relationship between the spots i buy and promotional mentions with a college radio station you can be all over the map without any expenditure of money

9080653 the implication is that people at risk of macular degeneration could help prevent the disease by consuming antioxidants
9080654 this work by dr vollmer snarr and colleagues ties these two damaging processes together and demonstrates the harm they cause in combination is much more than would be expected
9080655 suggests the possibility of interventions which could prove to be powerful ways to prevent or delay age related macular degeneration

9080659 we had a good effort today and it was nice to get some shots to the back of the net
9080660 hopefully weve made some progress and we can build on this and take it into sunday

9080664 we were pretty much aware that we werent raised in the mississippi delta
9080665 the subject responded confirming that he was bill sarto i informed the subject of the subpoena and the subject then denied he was bill sarto
9080666 how can i be charged with contempt when i havent been properly served

9080671 global food wastage must be halved by 2025 to meet the challenges of feeding the rapidly growing population and preserving global water supplies
9080672 as much as half the water used to grow food world wide is lost due to waste
9080673 roughly fifty percent of the food that farmers grow is lost or wasted
9080674 weak policy poor management increasing waste and exploding water demands are pushing the planet towards the tipping point of global water crisis
9080675 to place an effective water saving strategy requiring that food wastage be minimised firmly on the political agenda
9080676 though we did our best to hide it usually by using thicker than normal glasses i think people could easily tell that my left eye and i had been going in different personal and professional directions for some time
9080677 i wish it all the best in its future endeavors
9080678 im sitting there in the gold medal game with a straight face trying not to smile
9080679 spain are the guys we have to beat but im caught thats my player and i want to he claps his hands twice but i gotta he makes a serious face because we are going up against him
9080680 i was so impressed with him that it was to the point where after the second time i saw him i didnt sleep that night because i was moving my rotations around
9080681 i swear i did not sleep i could not sleep thinking about him because im saying we can put him here do this with him do that with him and brandon roy and do this so hes playing for us oh yeah i see that right now
9080682 it might be unfair calling jessica simpsons show at the avalon ballroom wednesday a train wreck at some point a train knows where its going
9080683 its very cool to have our team running so well to be on top of our game and its really fun to have somebody like kyle thats so fast
9080684 there have been a couple of races where its like either me or him and i think that brings out the best in a lot of people
9080685 for us its been a lot of fun like i said if it comes down to just him and i for the championship that would be fine but i have a feeling some of these other guys are gonna have something to say about that
9080686 besides that they have a little better race cars than us at sometimes then no not really
9080687 yeah theyve caught up to us the past few weeks but we finished second its hard to put that into trying to become any better
9080688 theres only one guy i guess that youre trying to beat the past two races but its that one guy thats going to haunt you the rest of the year all we can do is try to do our best and come up with some better packages to end the year out strong
9080689 i even joke around with guys with myself that carl is bff carl were best friends i dont believe its a rivalry i believe that we can still be friends and stuff like that and have that relationship on the racetrack
9080690 when ive won hes congratulated me and thats why all this stuff this week i kind of just got a chuckle out of it because i know deep down that what he says doesnt matter to me and what i say doesnt really matter to him what really matters is we race well on the racetrack so id say that well be fine
9080691 i dont think it means that if you get into another driver and spin him out then youre going to get suspended for a race
9080692 i think it has to do with the way that you got put on probation which is if you do the same thing that you did again then the repercussions for it are going to go up and that would probably be a suspension or something like that it means keep your post race antics down to a minimum
9080693 i just have to be a little extra careful not to let my emotions get the best of me
9080694 i did what i felt was best at the time and thats fine
9080695 the only bad part about it is just tearing up race cars when you dont need to
9080696 i couldve very easily drove off into turn three and doored him right in the left side quarter panel or something and spun him out
9080697 i didnt do that i tried to race him clean i tried to get back by him and i got bogged down a little bit by denny hamlin who got along side of me and we raced for a little bit
9080698 yeah it would mean a lot for us to win on a big track like this
9080699 mile and a half and above tracks and downforce tracks have been kind of our weak spot
9080700 weve been making a lot of gains hopefully we made some gains that will help us this weekend and moving into the chase
9080701 it just started the confidence in our minds that were ready for the chase
9080702 the top five guys in the points have a very good point of view or mind set theyre going to be in the chase so youre looking at what you need to do to be as good as you can in the chase and building the confidence around yourself and the team that you can be a contender
9080703 john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9080704 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia

9080707 in the honest belief that he needed to protect his son
9080708 it is beyond question that by acting in the way that he did mr khan killed mr brown unlawfully and whatever their differences the fact is that mr brown lost his life
9080709 that is a consequence for which mr khan must be punished with a significant custodial sentence
9080710 what became obvious as the evidence unfolded however is that from time to time despite denials to the contrary both mr brown and his son ashley barker were involved in acts of racial aggression towards members of mr khans family
9080711 theres lots of people whod like to do my job and no doubt actively trying to do it
9080712 i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9080713 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9080714 frankly if you had a reshuffle just now i think the public would say who are they anyway you name me a reshuffle that ever made a difference to a government actually im not expecting one imminently i do not think there will be a reshuffle
9080715 were grown ups but no one likes to read nasty things about their friends
9080716 one minute it was insisting there was no problem but it was now talking about apocalypse now and a return to the great depression
9080717 this generation has always made it up as it went along even at the age of 60 they are just as likely to overthrow the convention of marriage as they have done to so many others all their lives they think do i want to spend the rest of my life like this and often decide that they dont they realise they only have one life and that this is their moment
9080718 people in their 60s are really very youthful and full of energy nowadays and i dont think that theyre prepared to compromise in their private lives they might have been married to somebody for 30 years and have had children with them but that doesnt mean theyll think that its a good enough reason for spending the next 30 with them
9080719 i dont know a lot of other people my age who its happened to but i do know some i suppose at one time people stayed in marriages that they were bored with because they couldnt do much about it whereas now they can afford to go through with it and start again
9080720 the towers future is secure and it can now resume its role as sentinel on this stretch of coastline
9080721 failed to address in light of the allegations made by binyam mohamed the abhorrence and condemnation accorded to torture cruel inhuman or degrading treatment
9080722 confirmed the concern i have had for several years that the uk is complicit in extraordinary rendition
9080723 with any shred of self respect will be vigilant to ensure that it does not take part in this criminal savagery
9080724 we hardly needed evidence although there is more than enough that gitmo was going to be a torture chamber
9080725 professor chomsky is right to borrow from president clinton the world is much more impressed by the power of americas example than the example of american power likewise the world is more impressed by british principle than the pretense of britains special relationship a true friend to american would not stand by while president bush squanders americas birthright
9080726 the uk governments reaction to the us programme of rendition a policy of kidnapping people and taking them to places where they may be tortured has been inadequate to say the least it is scarcely credible that now despite all we know about rendition and the uks involvement in it the british government still refuses to condemn this illegal immoral and counterproductive policy
9080727 as an atlanticist i believe that a strong transatlantic alliance is an essential part of combating dangerous extremism but this does not mean turning a blind eye or as the high court recently found in the case of binyam mohamed facilitating americas deeply damaging rendition programme we cannot afford to undermine the values we are seeking to export the uk must use its influence to convince the united states that rendition does precisely this
9080728 i think perhaps chomsky has been looking in the wrong place the mail on sunday and i have certainly been trenchant in our criticism of some this the war in iraq and guantanamo for example we were one of the first to run pictures of the orange jumpsuits alongside stories about guantanamo
9080729 in some respects there has been a failure of the modern left where traditional leftwing writers have been supporting the war on terror as some sort of liberal crusade that is partly because of the labour government which made the left believe they have had friends in office chomsky needs to look in other places if he wants to find voices of criticism
9080730 the region was taken by a treaty that cuba was forced to sign under military occupation
9080731 the proper and natural extension of classical liberalism into the era of advanced industrial society
9080732 it is one of the ultimate races in the world it is also the toughest it takes 15 days of driving 800km 500 miles a day which is pretty hard going there is a lot of mental strain as well before you start you have to get your team together as well as sponsorship its not just a race against others its a test against yourself we live in a nanny state so to go and push your boundaries to the limit is really healthy you see what you can achieve in life if you want something enough at the time its not much fun but the satisfaction you feel afterwards makes it worthwhile even though i didnt finish due to injury i still feel a huge sense of achievement
9080733 i started the festival 21 years ago to establish a worldwide standard for quality of cannabis and its held every thanksgiving growers and breeders come here to compete for the prize of the best harvest if other plants have harvest festivals then why shouldnt cannabis cannabis is one of the planets most revered plants do we have fun sure theres a lot of pot smoking going on
9080734 it can be a great experience to go to ascot but it would not be top of my list of things to do i would rather go surfing in bali or see kangaroos breed in australia or the wonders of the world say than see a lot of people in top hats while it is fun im not sure it should be on the list is it seeing the pyramids at dawn i dont think so it is not in the do or die bracket
9080735 its a very quirky thing to do and its a good conversation starter to say you have been in the bog it is a bizarre experience when youre snorkelling your way through and wondering how on earth you ended up there its dark and you cant see and that is scary you bump into the sides a lot
9080736 the first time i went to the biennale was in 1982 and i thought it was great there is no doubt its one of the best events in the world it has become a model for a lot of other biennales which do similar things biennales are an incredible visual feast certain artists can only be seen at biennales theyre like rock musicians who only play at festivals
9080737 hollering was something people did to communicate when working on farms in america before the invention of phones if it werent for the contest hollering would be a thing of the past
9080738 im in it for the challenge we have a parade every year here in beaver oklahoma and the contest just developed as a part of that practice is all it takes and a lot of luck youre supposed to lick your fingers for luck between the first and second throws
9080739 if you go to chelsea early the weather is good and you take long enough to have a proper look around then the flower show here is definitely a world class event
9080740 an asset stripping exercise directed as enabling him to carry on its business through another company with a similar name
9080741 the administrators were attempting to negotiate with someone mr foster who they knew to be bereft of the basics of commercial morality he was not to be trusted
9080742 we have completed a cursory search of the annexe part of the main building which is relatively intact following the fire
9080743 officers have completed a search of the outbuildings and are now in the process of removing vehicles from the site im aware that there is a lot of speculation concerning this incident and we are anxious to clarify the exact circumstances as soon as possible
9080744 however i stress this will be a lengthy process and we would ask for the support and co operation of the local community while we continue to work at the scene nearly 100 officers and support staff are continuing to work round the clock
9080745 they looked like they were enjoying themselves and chris got a bit drunk
9080746 they were among the last to leave at about 8 30pm and seemed completely normal
9080747 the whole family are in limbo at the moment and we have no idea what has happened not knowing whats happened just makes it even more difficult its a terrible waiting game we are all just too upset to say anything else at the moment
9080748 we are very concerned for the safety of kirstie and her family who are in our thoughts and prayers
9080749 kirstie is a charming popular and hard working girl with many friends all of whom are hoping that she and her family will be found safe and well
9080750 chris was a good family man and a very nice chap he liked to live life big with holidays and cars he adored his daughter he was just an ordinary everyday chap well dressed a good businessman
9080751 hes not dead he has got places he can go places scattered around europe there are properties that nobody knows about he can go and just disappear in my view they wont find him or his family when they go in there
9080752 what we want is new ways of thinking about the opening ceremony
9080753 we want the whole of london to be involved with different parts of london taking part in the ceremony the london games must be deeply democratic with the citys citizens feeling theyre intimately involved i think what you will see is a very vivid sense of celebration right across the city at both the opening and closing ceremonies
9080754 we want to create the expectation that seats will have people on them
9080755 you cant stop sponsors buying seats nor should you but we must maximise the publics chances of seeing the games first hand
9080756 in terms of great organisation fantastic facilities and a welcoming attitude and pride among the people beijing was superb
9080757 but there are things we can and will do better i saw lots and lots of chinese people standing outside stadiums on the wrong part of a perimeter fence as observers rather than participants we must reverse that trend and make sure our olympics are more accessible i also want to minimise the number of empty seats in stadiums which frustrate the public and keep them at a distance for no reason and i want our volunteers to be trained better and given a more clearly defined role
9080758 we cannot commit to such ideas at this stage but the principle of getting more people to museums and increasing access to londons cultural heritage we endorse
9080759 sporting participation is both an end in itself and a means to other ends
9080760 if you look at what works as an anti crime pro education pro health strategy among the young especially those from poorer backgrounds sport is unmatched
9080761 we have a cabinet committee working on security and high level planning is well advanced
9080762 el popular y contestatario rockero cubano gorki guila l der de la banda de rock porno para ricardo fue arrestado por la polic a en la habana en horas de la ma ana del 25 de agosto y un d a despu s sus familiares no hab an podido visitarlo

9080766 a group of people who arrange to assemble briefly in a public place to perform some activity often of a humorous or surreal nature
9080767 sure just carry on up here past the supermarket and its on your right
9080768 dont hold back totally go for it you look stupid and youre behaving madly in a public place this is not normal probably so you might as well throw yourself in to the spirit of the thing
9080769 we believe we can begin the work on the northbound lanes without significant traffic impact
9080770 our experience with the southbound lane closures have been very positive weve seen very few and very minor traffic backups
9080771 i was pretty sure i was safe its definitely frustrating it changes the outcome of the game
9080772 it changes the momentum instead of being down 3 2 they get out of the inning soriano comes up and hits a home run now theyre up 3 2
9080773 i dont really want to get into that stuff as far as taking instant replay to every aspect of the game
9080774 were playing good because we feel very confident at home and everybody is healthy
9080775 as long as you get it right i dont want to get into the replay thing
9080776 the guy called him out and the ump wasnt going to change it
9080777 i didnt really feel him hit the bag i just wanted to go over there and get the ball and you know guccione called him out so hes out
9080778 the ball kicked away from me i was able to get it
9080779 a bang bang play and i dont know i didnt see a replay yet but i heard it was pretty close
9080780 i just wanted to document the security and the excitement around this candidacy
9080781 the secret service agent in the driveway told us we could take pictures but we had to take pictures from the other side of the street
9080782 you cant park on either side of the street anymore or down the street or down obamas street
9080783 we will make every effort to ensure that any adjustments in security effecting area residents will be as unobtrusive as possible
9080784 were a lot more secure than we were six months ago
9080785 to me its been a lot quieter around here you dont see as much kids hanging out on corners
9080786 its a pretty small price to pay for him and hopefully what hell be able to do for our country
9080787 a lot of the invitations had direct reference to the harley events that were going on right now along with provocative pictures that had been posted on there
9080788 the undercover officers will ask them how much they charge for sexual favors and at that time they arrest them once they tell us that
9080789 did you ever here about people using those to solicit prostitutes
9080790 escort services are nothing but a front for prostitution and every arrest that weve had has proven that out
9080791 theyve been here for so many years untouched and it takes a senseless act for someone to come in and decide to do something like this i mean its ridiculous
9080792 thats just like really disheartening especially for me being a mom and a parent and whatnot
9080793 1921 and he passed away in 1922 so this is an infant burial of a one year old child
9080794 what was going through your mind when you first saw this
9080795 anger how could somebody actually come in here and do this its a peaceful place
9080796 i am very surprised that somebody on a summer night didnt have their windows open and hear the commotion that was going on because there was a lot of damage done
9080797 thats going to be one of the hardest things ive had to do you know call family members and let them know that their marker for their family member has been destroyed or ruined or taken off the base and were going to need to fix that
9080798 your family puts you here for a final rest and you cant rest
9080799 it will be more or less damage control to physicians
9080800 barrack announces victory and a hard fought win in nevada
9080801 when i hear a statement like that coming from a woman candidate with any kind of perceived whine about that excess criticism or maybe a sharper microscope put on her that doesnt do us any good
9080802 so be it i mean work harder prove yourself hillary to an even greater degree that youre capable your gonna be the best candidate
9080803 can we upgrade our electronics design perhaps add a few critical features in the process and get another five to ten years product life
9080804 dont be fooled glaxosmithklines scare tactics are only concerned with protecting its profit not the health of people with hiv aids
9080805 basically in very short and lay terms an ad cannot be false cannot be misleading and must have what is called fair balance
9080806 ask your doctor if there are hiv medications with a low risk of diarrhea
9080807 theyre more or less fighting for market share at this point
9080808 one of the classic examples of that would be the pepsi challenge
9080809 from my perspective this is the way that gsk has always kind of handled things in the past
9080810 their modus operandi is always kind of to bash the competition and they do that in a number of ways
9080811 running jaws ads is just going to raise the anxiety level very high for people nervous about getting treatment this could put them over the edge
9080812 hamas just wants to show theyre different from the palestinian government to pretend that they are the real government here

9080819 the poor guy who died wasnt involved in anything he was trying to help
9080820 he was charged with murder wow im surprised they made this decision
9080821 he acted like he was aiming but it was random just random shooting
9080822 my sister keep talking about moving to a safer neighborhood but she was born in brooklyn and wants to stay in brooklyn
9080823 she was just standing outside enjoying the summer night and someone just started shooting it isnt right
9080824 otis said sophia told him get to inside because there was trouble
9080825 he is going to be bummed that he cant play basketball for a while but he is a good kid and will recover
9080826 we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9080827 exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help us fight the same old washington politics
9080828 stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9080829 think that by choosing her they can go after the womens vote but shes pro life and that doesnt match up with what women voters are looking for in a female candidate

9080844 john mccain put palin a heartbeat away from the presidency
9080845 mr ahmadinejad id like another try at that response i dont believe my first accurately communicated my feelings
9080846 the fact that she will soon be nominated is one more indicator of this country moving forward
9080847 they had to bring power theyre the power company so big whoopdy do anyway it was really nothing that came out of this meeting except them to try to make themselves look good that they care well the point being is theyre responsible for this to begin with
9080848 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
9080849 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further
9080850 preterm babies are known to have increased breathing difficulties in proportion to their prematurity and cigarette smoke is known to increase apneas in full term babies
9080851 but until now cigarette smoke exposure and preterm birth have not been investigated together with respect to their potential effects on respiratory dysfunction
9080852 our study shows that preterm infants make incomplete and or delayed recovery from interruptions in breathing
9080853 this has clear implications for their risk of sids but there is even still another reason for concern even after the risk of sids has passed inability or delayed recovery from repeated low oxygen episodes can also be detrimental to brain development there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders
9080854 i defy anybody to say what are the rights of a citizen if they do not include the control of his own diet in relation to his own health
9080855 the timid civilized world has found nothing with which to oppose the onslaught of a sudden revival of barefaced barbarity other than concessions and smiles
9080856 we have had growth not insignificant growth in our national income household disposable income has continued to rise our employment numbers remain very high historically so people talk about a technical recession even if thats true i dont think its a real recession
9080857 its a recession when your neighbour loses his job its a depression when you lose yours
9080858 to face the biggest forces shaping this century the emergence of russia china and india as great powers and the emergence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front in the war on terror
9080859 if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets
9080860 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
9080861 its a good result the staff are happy because theyve still got jobs in a tough market
9080862 we advertised the business heavily and attracted a number of interested parties
9080863 the new owners believe they can grow the business and increase the employment opportunities
9080864 a robust business and its fundamentals were intact its just unfortunate that it was carrying a lot of debt
9080865 we expect it to pick up timfin has been part of the mount business environment since the 1960s its an institution and we are very happy to be involved
9080866 one of the critical factors was the calibre of the staff we wont be there all the time and we will be reliant on the management team who know the business well
9080867 we will re ignite the business over there they also sold a bit to united states and we will re investigate that
9080868 i guess it must be in our blood to get involved with timber manufacturing at this time

9080870 we send our congratulations to governor palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president her selection is yet another encouraging sign that all barriers are falling in our politics and while we obviously have differences over how to best lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign

9080887 due to the threat posed by hurricane gustav which has demonstrated potential to severely impact the entire state
9080888 i urge all mississippians to please take this storm seriously
9080889 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
9080890 we have had conferences with the counties north and south of jackson on steps we all need to take to be prepared
9080891 you should take the same precautions that you would when there is the risk of ice storm in that you need to check all equipment and collect some supplies in case there is a loss of utilities
9080892 the bolivar county ema office is on standby with mema
9080893 in fact everything is set in place if movement needs to be done
9080894 we have been having daily press conferences in preparation of a possible hurricane on the coast
9080895 entergy mississippi is monitoring the weather and networking and collecting resources
9080896 with every event there are lessons to be learned and hurricanes katrina and rita taught us a lot
9080897 we did a really good job getting the lights back on for people but there are always ways to improve
9080898 i think that what we learned from katrina is reflected in our plans of late
9080899 we have 13 hotels in the delta and in the span of two hours we sold close to 1 000 rooms in 2005
9080900 when new orleans gave an evacuation notice the people scrambled
9080901 the rooms go quickly once jackson fills up theres nothing up towards highway 82
9080902 the whole mississippi delta gets exhausted by 50 000 100 000 people looking for rooms its really a tough situation and after the experience three years ago there are probably a lot more scared people
9080903 pet owners need to make sure they have a good source of shelter for their pets in the event of a hurricane or any storm
9080904 the animals need to have shelter they can get in out of the weather
9080905 make sure they have a name tag and all their proper paper work also
9080906 make sure their tags have all the necessary information on it this will help people locate their home if your animal does run off
9080907 fred radtke is a classic example of city government failure and hes stepping in to fill the void
9080908 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9080909 you cant be chopping and changing people that often i mean undoubtedly at some stage before the end of parliament he gordon brown will want to do a reshuffle but i am not expecting one imminently
9080910 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9080911 the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9080912 gordon brown has briefed out stories that he has an economic recovery plan all worked out meanwhile the chancellor says the downturn will be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9080913 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a labour government has left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag
9080914 i worry about the government lurching from one extreme to the other
9080915 until very recently there was no problem there was a state of denial britain was the strongest country in the western world any problems we had were from overseas
9080916 now suddenly weve lurched into apocolypse now the return of the great depression
9080917 these are the same difficult economic circumstances that every other country in the world is having to deal with
9080918 we also wanted her to know that she was not alone
9080919 im getting bored with the lindy scene so now im doing west coast swing
9080920 im getting bored with the lindy scene so now im doing west coast swing
9080921 oh dont worry itll jump out at you sooner or later just carry a shoe around with you
9080922 theres lots of people whod like to do my job and no doubt actively trying to do it
9080923 i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9080924 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9080925 frankly if you had a reshuffle just now i think the public would say who are they anyway you name me a reshuffle that ever made a difference to a government actually im not expecting one imminently i do not think there will be a reshuffle
9080926 were grown ups but no one likes to read nasty things about their friends
9080927 one minute it was insisting there was no problem but it was now talking about apocalypse now and a return to the great depression
9080928 this suggests that stressful events do not protect us from the effect of additional events and even moderate or mild events seem to have a cumulative effect
9080929 women who suffer severe losses in their young age should be considered as a breast cancer risk group and be treated accordingly

9080934 we embrace all of our legends but its all the sweeter when one of our home players takes home the prize
9080935 this was a hard won victory and viewers will be on the edge of their seats with this episode
9080936 sometimes he loses feel and just misses on pitches part of him is still harnessing who he is at all times
9080937 surely the sox know the importance of opportunism locked in a pennant race as they are
9080938 its one of the toughest games ive lost just being ahead like that and then all of a sudden boom
9080939 the decline of the steel industry in the 1970s coincided with the rise of the steelers dynasty at a time when the citys collective psyche was taking a major blow the local football team offered a weekly respite a generation of young people left the city to find work elsewhere but they remained passionate about their hometown team and thats why your local stadiums are often invaded by a black and gold army
9080940 jd is the most consistent player ive had in five years here this guy goes out every day and puts up numbers low key and wins the mvp in the world series and nobody knows about it he was in the running for the american league mvp and nobody knew about it
9080941 i told him he couldnt go he will be alone
9080942 who do you think took his hand and walked him home
9080943 web 2 0 i attended another session on day three run by a representative of hobsons so ill talk more about that later
9080944 is it just me or do you get a kind of
9080945 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9080946 sometimes you just get to a point where you sit down and say yeah its the right
9080947 ytb international inc eliminated 17 positions today wednesday representing less than 5 percent of our work force as part of a reorganization to reduce operating expenses and curtail redundancies
9080948 this move places the company in an even better position to realize its goals and effectively manage its continued growth
9080949 we have reached out to our customers and community leaders and they told us that reliability is the most important need they have this rate case is all about investing in reliability to provide a secure energy future for missouri
9080950 we did not take lightly the fact we recommended a strike
9080951 this is not just talking about 27 000 members this is talking about 27 000 members and their families
9080952 we felt it was important to assume both insured and uninsured deposits and we believe it is our responsibility as a leading national institution to work with and support the fdic in providing safe harbours for depositors in this challenging time
9080953 despite todays announcement it is important to emphasize that the overwhelming majority of banks operating in georgia 96 per cent are well capitalized and have adequate reserves
9080954 taxpayers should never be forced to finance bureaucrats i love me walls of framed awards and photos nor should residents be shelling out for floral bouquets beauty treatments or caffeine fixes
9080955 clearly no missouri politicians could claim with a straight face that all of the fat has been cut out of the states budget
9080956 this is exactly what we expected and envisioned when we created the map site
9080957 transparency and openness help root out wasteful spending and we welcome this scrutiny
9080958 according to the 2001 land law the lake itself should be inalienable state land so its ownership cannot be transferred for longer than 15 years during which time the function of the property must not change
9080959 many of the families have strong legal claims to the land under the land law
9080960 we are very concerned what will happen to our houses and livelihoods and the possibility that we will have to move
9080961 we ask the company to halt the process of filling in the lake and meet the community to discuss the issue
9080962 i think i speak for all families when i say the boeung kak lake area is very easy to live in
9080963 even poor people can make a living catching snails in the lake the water is polluted but this is being used as an excuse to force people out in the name of development
9080964 i want to stress the compensation offer is not acceptable to the people
9080965 if the government wishes to develop boeung kak they should do so through a legal process with the participation of communities that live around the lake
9080966 there is an expectation that a lot more evictions will happen and that evictions in the works for some time will now get the green light
9080967 we are concerned that a number of evictions could be carried out after the election and we call on the government to respect the laws of cambodia and their international human rights obligations
9080968 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future the strategy outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities
9080969 london is not unique all major cities such as new york and tokyo are at risk from climate change
9080970 it is essential that the capital prepares for the impacts of climate change which is already affecting londoners through increased flood risk heavier and more frequent downpours and extreme heat
9080971 thousands of photos are sent to visa pour as proposals for exhibitions and evening programs and over the last two or three years these pictures have been increasingly neat and tidy increasingly standardized and to put it bluntly tedious with the same old stories seen from the same old angles and this tendency is getting even stronger
9080972 holy cow this is a game changer if in fact john mccain has chosen her serious game changer wow
9080973 im so hot and sweaty because weve been jumping around and hugging
9080974 the insta wife is ecstatic which may bode well for that demographic id like it if she had more executive experience but to be fair shes got more than anyone else on either ticket is she too liberal on gay rights not for me but maybe for some people
9080975 shes probably the most dynamic young conservative in the country
9080976 can anyone say with a straight face that palin would have gotten picked if she were a man
9080977 considering both mccains advanced age and the state of the world today it is essential that the veep be exceedingly qualified to assume the office of president i dont have any confidence in palins ability to deal effectively with iran russia china etc i certainly will not cast a vote for obama biden but nor will i vote for mccain palin
9080978 someone as inexperienced and lacking in foreign policy and national security background as sarah palin
9080979 she looks great on the stump and speaks very well her husband it turns out is a member of the steelworkers union and looks like he was sent by central casting
9080980 will it get my lifelong democrat parents and hillary fans to vote gop ill work on them were all scoop jackson democrats quite conservative staying with the party because they are staunchly pro union dad is retired railroad like it or not mccain is really a scoop jackson democrat its just the party left them behind when they went well left i migrated to the gop they remain dem out of loyalty but reserve the right to vote for whomever they please will this tip the scales look at it this way no other vp nominee would have me even entertain the idea
9080981 at a time when many republicans are still clinging to pork barrel politics governor palin has quickly become a leader on this issue
9080982 she is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the republican brand
9080983 a hero of conservatives when she killed the bridge to nowhere her willingness to take on pork barrel spending and government corruption sends a strong signal to washington her extensive experience on energy issues and her pro life record demonstrate a commitment to free market values and conservative principles
9080984 ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport but the 398 million bridge is not the answer
9080985 despite the work of our congressional delegation we are about 329 million short of full funding for the bridge project and its clear that congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between ketchikan and gravina island
9080986 much of the publics attitude toward alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here but we need to focus on what we can do rather than fight over what has happened
9080987 unfortunately with her support for drilling in the arctic refuge and off our coasts governor palin will simply continue the failed policies of the bush cheney administration and their big oil friends policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil
9080988 why when the country is fighting two wars facing an uncertain economy and an energy crisis did senator mccain make the choice that he did
9080989 why with so many other qualified women and men in his party did john mccain choose sarah palin sarah palin is not the right choice
9080990 trig is beautiful and already adored by us we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives we have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place we are truly blessed
9080991 it shows that she not only talks pro life she is pro life
9080992 sadly but not surprisingly identity politics has run amok in this country in my view palin wouldnt have been seriously considered for vice president but for her gender but at least she appears to be a very substantial person with real potential for high office
9080993 what an odd argument to make in favor of palin
9080994 were in real danger of losing what makes maps so unique giving us a feel for a place even if weve never been there
9080995 im happy to light a stick of dynamite under them if its going to make hospitals better
9080996 i try to stay away from comparisons i also try to stay away from talking about schools where ive worked because then your current players wonder where your head is
9080997 can anyone say with a straight face that palin would have gotten picked if she were a man
9080998 its a plate of haggis with a plastic knife and fork and everybody who has entered sits down at the big table
9080999 its quite difficult because its plastic knives and forks and the plastic sometimes breaks
9081000 ive already spoken to technical support and or ram guy
9081001 its quite a large fire and quite a complex fire in the sense that its got a number of dangerous chemicals that we are dealing with at this point in time
9081002 we will investigate it once the fire has been extinguished and then we will get in later today or tomorrow morning
9081003 there is a fair bit to still take under control and well be here for a number of hours yet throughout the day
9081004 folks look given this pick and all i have learned about what would happen with a democratic victory we have no choice but to enthusiastically work for the mccain palin ticket
9081005 should i be true to the original capture less artifacts in future if i need to edit things
9081006 should i be true to how it was meant to be seen
9081007 give me a break do you actually believe this are you out of your mind
9081008 im happy im a happy guy whats the point what would i want this for why would i need it tell me convince me
9081009 im not interested in you youre ok youre fine we dont need to have this conversation im going to go over there in the whorehouse thats where i need to have the conversation where the money is exchanging hands these are the people that need to hear this so stop detaining me
9081010 come on really do you honestly believe this stuff how can that be
9081011 huh if he believes this then maybe i better look into it
9081012 wow it must be very difficult being a christian actor that must be the toughest thing
9081013 its not the toughest thing trying being a christian lawyer try being a christian fireman try being a christian anything its tough
9081014 this is going to be the heartbeat i think of what goes on at the republican national convention
9081015 we want to have real time information passed to all entities
9081016 theyre events that are looked at for what dignitaries are going to be there what kind of crowds are going to be there
9081017 is it a symbolic event that is going to be an attractive target for someone that would commit a terrorist attack or a criminal attack
9081018 we have more fbi resources here than previously for any event in minnesota
9081019 but were ready just in the event because we have that responsibility
9081020 blow em up tie em throw them in blow em up tie em throw them in over and over and over and over
9081021 ive blown up so many i dont even know how many
9081022 i had no idea we were going to blow up 100 000 balloons but its okay im here for john mccain
9081023 being able to say we blew up those balloons is pretty cool
9081024 the most unsophisticated chokehold that any judo instructor would completely despise you for ever using
9081025 and this is the kind of choke that people who have no martial skills at all would employ and um and yet it uh uh was completely painless for her
9081026 um you know nina was wonderful in so many ways im so sorry
9081027 human life is sacred and i took the life of a human being and i am very sorry for that
9081028 i dont think ill be able to make up to society for what ive done but ill try to the extent that i can
9081029 and i am very sorry for the terrible harm ive caused my children ill try to contribute to society while in prison
9081030 for the time that ive wasted for all the people who worked very hard to convict me of my crime
9081031 in a grave where her children will be able to come and talk to her rather than in the dirt of the oakland hills
9081032 was the right thing to do it brings a lot of closure
9081033 know where nina is for sure theres no question about it now
9081034 he didnt get off to a great start but he was actually faster in his final two miles than he was in his first so we know hes going in the right direction
9081035 this gives us something to work off of and see where we are at to start the season
9081036 more inert than argon gas and given over to obvious directorial hissy fits babylon a d is like a bad dream a cyberpunk once had after watching find me guilty
9081037 were arranging counselling for the families as well as the police officers because of the numbers and the amount of notifications the police have had to do
9081038 a vehicle with at least two different energy converters and two different energy storage systems gasoline and electric on board the vehicle for the purpose of vehicle propulsion
9081039 leaving the baby in the bushes like that if the baby hadnt been found it probably wouldnt have survived for long
9081040 youre going to see a lot of people who are extremely skeptical it would seem that you would need a little more time
9081041 a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
9081042 they werent ideal conditions but this gives us a good starting point i thought our top five ran strong by finishing only 41 seconds apart
9081043 now we just have to get them running closer to the front
9081044 i hope its getting very clear that weve very serious about emea
9081045 googles trying to do all your search needs what microsoft is doing with this kind of acquisition is saying were going to be very good at the commercial side of search the shopping
9081046 doing this shopping thing i think is a good move
9081047 nobody is able to compete right now with google so there is nobody to buy to compete with google
9081048 but we also believe its very early days in search technology
9081049 constructed from freely available plumbing electrical and laboratory components the gas organ is a fusion of art science and engineering beautiful in its clinical appearance and mesmerizing in its auditory effect
9081050 the pyrophone juggernaut based on a 250 year old experimental musical instrument hubbub musics pyrophone juggernaut is the largest hand operated multi octave fire organ in the world deep growls atavistic moans and even choral sounding timbres combine with epic bell chords industrial drums and acoustic bass this giant flame fuelled instrument made from stainless steel copper and aluminium industrial salvage will create a spectacular unearthly concert of heart pulsing rhythms ethereal melodies and sub sonic percussive drones
9081051 they started dropping the bombs at seven oclock in the evening of the 11 th
9081052 they were black planes the cattle ran all over the place some of the cattle were killed
9081053 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9081054 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9081055 mccain clearly sees the power of women voters in this election but has just as clearly failed to support any of the issues that they care about his choice for vice president only reinforces that failure
9081056 cwm has a special burns unit and the patients could be treated better there
9081057 they are trying to hang on to last straw as we make in roads in giving a real voice and say to ordinary people in the country
9081058 well im a methodist and they methodist church certainly do not represent me
9081059 naturally there are some power hungry ethno nationalist leaders and followers supported by the leadership of the methodist church and some chiefs who would not want ordinary people to be empowered in terms of decision making and aspiring for better things in life
9081060 they want to continue to remain in power and in the process ensure that the common people remain disenfranchised
9081061 to some degree it seems different because he is a minority
9081062 he has done a good job at being a candidate for change i know he has mentioned some specific native issues like economic stability on the reservations and he understands that this is a federal responsibility to take care of it
9081063 i do know that it is going on but i really dont have time right now to stop and notice anything different about the atmosphere on campus
9081064 i think if obama becomes president it will show change in the world you know it will prove that its not all about color anymore
9081065 obama has a lot of bad things about him that i dont want to associate with our president
9081066 if we vote him in he will be another bill clinton in office obama financially supports a white racist church and i dont see how we can be ok with our president doing that
9081067 its hard to say but from my experience american indian students are not as interested in the broader elections
9081068 they are probably not as involved as they should be
9081069 all we know is that theres going to be another president nothing will ever really change
9081070 it is simply not yet possible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
9081071 it has come as another massive blow to us we have had to cancel
9081072 this is the not the first bump in the road we have had in fact it has been a total nightmare to try and keep this festival together with one problem after another this one has finally knocked us down and we are not getting back up from it

9081080 arboga is a village with nothing in it apart from a tiny shop and that was it we actually lived at the studio so it meant we could all just focus on the music fredrik was a cool guy and he taught us how to do stuff so at night after hed gone home wed still be recording the album
9081081 this seems to be the work of the gulf cartel
9081082 we will have to see where the heads turn up i am sure they will try something spectacular to shock society
9081083 the risks associated with antipsychotic use in patients with dementia generally outweigh the potential benefits and in this patient group use of antipsychotic drugs should be avoided whenever possible
9081084 we dont know why this extra risk associated with antipsychotics is even greater in people with dementia
9081085 i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
9081086 i just think he doesnt know how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million americans
9081087 john mccain likes to say that hell follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell
9081088 but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9081089 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me

9081091 permission was not sought or granted nor would it have been given van halen are not political theyre just rock and roll
9081092 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible
9081093 she is shooting now we are not giving out any specifics on her character
9081094 twelve years ago i would have been hard pressed to understand why id want to be involved sexually with one person this long
9081095 before tea the longest my intense sexual interest would last would be maybe two years but the real rewards of a relationship come after youve been together a while thats where tea and i are lucky
9081096 theres nothing wrong with acknowledging the panoply of lifes rich experience you cant control your mind why would you want to you cant feel guilty about being alive about being a man about feeling attracted you can only control your actions
9081097 i cant say how proud i am of this department
9081098 this is the most unique investigation ive seen in my 19 years
9081099 he put me on some crazy romanian horses ive done a little riding and i knew the second i got on that animal that it did not know what it was supposed to do
9081100 they horses all ran off in different directions and went berserk every time theyd clap the clapperboard to start a scene my horse ran right into a tree and threw me in a water tank
9081101 i had a catheter in my arm because i was sick from eating the food over there
9081102 i dont even know what his movies are about and why he keeps the same theme of people in the jungle and the vampires who ride in from space sic what are you doing uwe bloodrayne was an abomination its a horrifying and preposterous movie
9081103 uwe was fun if he called me tomorrow and wanted me to be in a movie i would do it
9081104 jared had swimming lessons since the time he was 4 years old
9081105 he was a good kid just living life the way he wanted to
9081106 the swimming area is an unguarded swim at your own risk beach area
9081107 i really like you so much and have a lot of respect for you but i would like to marry you and i have a question which side of the bed do you prefer to sleep on
9081108 you are very cute but you know my boyfriend will kill you
9081109 i just found out im going to do tarantinos next film with brad pitt and im very excited quentin just called
9081110 after many years in the planning and discussion stage we have finally completed the re recording of bonded by blood we have decided to call it let there be blood and it is our way of paying homage to paul baloff former exodus vocalist who passed away in 2002 by showing how relevant these songs we had written together still are we arent trying to replace the original thats impossible anyway we are just giving these songs the benefit of modern production its something we talked about before paul s death and its always been important to us to do we were super excited about entering the studio once again to record these classics and now its back to writing the next studio record
9081111 i have been singing these songs regularly for three years now and i have totally made them my own but with all the nuances that
9081112 this record is a total homage to him with modern technology and for fun if he was around which it is unfortunate that he not he would be doing this record
9081113 my life is cool now but it was cool before i joined exodus i made good money had a great apartment in l a and i traveled everywhere and surfed regularly
9081114 i will give these songs all the venom and hate i can give and its all for the love i have for these songs and this band if those out there dont like it and think its not good listen to the original it will always stand the test of time
9081115 queen collection amp there were specific qs for this line of cg
9081116 i wasnt sure if he hit his head until i really started trying to look into his eyes and then realized what i was looking for wasnt there
9081117 my children and i had our bags packed cause we didnt know how many were involved at the time we knew by the word arrests that there was going to be more than one
9081118 and we had our bags packed and ready to run because we didnt know whether they were going to be caught and whether we were next
9081119 my ex husband didnt have the money to hire so how
9081120 hes anguished about the situation hes in hes very concerned about his kids and his family circumstances the charges are very serious and hes concerned about that
9081121 you know it would be inappropriate i havent asked him that but had he told me anything it would be inappropriate to tell you that
9081122 i said really youre not on camera theyre looking around to see if theyre on camera and it was a joke
9081123 we felt it was important to assume both insured and uninsured deposits and we believe it is our responsibility as a leading national institution to work with and support the fdic in providing safe harbours for depositors in this challenging time
9081124 left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling
9081125 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet
9081126 and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9081127 im a woman and youre a woman so you should vote for me as vp
9081128 sarah palin a commercial fisherman from wasilla told her husband on tuesday she was driving to anchorage to shop at costco instead she headed straight for ivana
9081129 these results show the strong growth in the groups profitability
9081130 winning isnt everything its the only thing and how does his choice reflect the rovian desire to win at any cost something with which every americans is already familiar
9081131 we were down for about down for about 2 1 2 days with katrina then up and operating
9081132 we learned a lot from that experience and are setting up accordingly
9081133 oh you people want a black man in that seat well heres clarence thomas for ya
9081134 a black snake can bite you just as bad as a white snake
9081135 oh you people want a woman on the ticket well heres sarah palin for ya
9081136 we did not take lightly the fact we recommended a strike
9081137 this is not just talking about 27 000 members this is talking about 27 000 members and their families
9081138 were extremely disappointed that the union is recommending that our employees reject what adds up to the best contract in the aerospace industry
9081139 we hope our employees recognize the value of this offer
9081140 we encourage them to study it calculate what it means to them and their families and vote in their best interests on sept 3 this is our best and final offer and thats what it means
9081141 were supposed to be a world class company but they dont want to give us a world class contract
9081142 they made 13 billion and they dont want to share
9081143 boeing is rolling the dice on this theres no question about that
9081144 because i want my daughters to have the exact same opportunities as your sons
9081145 the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief
9081146 how can john mccain cut our dependence on foreign oil without upsetting the oil companies who back him
9081147 well it works for obama but hes a great orator and im not so im not going to try what obama did
9081148 i am like you i understand where you are coming from
9081149 im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
9081150 i know you are not whiners but thats what mccains campaign thinks of you
9081151 i care about you and i understand you mccain may pretend to care but hes not going to do anything at all to help you out
9081152 if john mccain gave up the health care that he gets from the government paid for by your tax dollars and the socialized medicine he gets as a veteran also paid for by your tax dollars and tried to use the plan he is trying to force on all americans he would have a hard time finding a company to insure him with his pre existing conditions and at his age it would be almost impossible to find any insurance anywhere in america at any price john mccain doesnt even realize this is a problem since he wants to force this on all of us i do see the problem and i promise i will fix it john mccain does not understand how health care operates in america and it would be a disaster to put him in charge of changing it
9081153 so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
9081154 you may not agree with me but here is what i believe and here is something i think we can agree on
9081155 theres no real light at the end of the tunnel for newspapers
9081156 its not clear where the revenues are going to bottom out
9081157 the cuts that theyve taken have not been able to compensate for the decline in revenue as the revenue picture becomes more bleak those cost actions have accelerated
9081158 online has not proven to be unaffected by economic conditions
9081159 they are making a lot of these cuts up front so they can be in a position to turn the organization around
9081160 theres certainly the risk that a number of newspaper companies could run out of time
9081161 before they make the transition online and theres no evidence that making such a transition is a certainty
9081162 it will pick up again if we dont diminish the product so much that they dont rebound
9081163 senator mccain made an outstanding pick from the choices that were on the table sarah palin clearly addresses the issues so many conservatives are concerned about
9081164 sarah palin is the whole package there couldnt be a better vice presidential pick
9081165 women voters are electrified and sarah is someone who is truly in sync with the way real american women think
9081166 she is a reform minded woman who will give all americans born and unborn the authentic leadership they deserve
9081167 the majority of american women support commonsense restrictions on abortion adding palin to the gop ticket will resonate with independent women voters nationwide
9081168 governor palin is a committed and active christian who takes her faith seriously and lives her pro life and pro family convictions
9081169 y despu s de las vacaciones todav a m s que antes
9081170 no habr presupuestos a menos que no los pacten los socialistas con el pp
9081171 lo que tenemos que hacer es apretarles e invitarlos a esta estrategia
9081172 no aceptaremos un mal acuerdo ni ninguna imposici n no se puede responder con imposiciones a las razones de catalunya

9081176 lo que pedimos no es un capricho ni un privilegio sino una necesidad
9081177 bajo un discurso de solidaridad y nacionalismo pretenden hacer pasar privilegios por solidaridad
9081178 hace ocho a os algunos dec an que no hay muchas diferencias entre los candidatos pero aqu estamos en el 2008 y dudo que alguien diga ahora que la elecci n no importa

9081180 las faldas sumamente cortas que visten algunas estudiantes se convierten en una invitaci n a ser agredidas o molestadas
9081181 si quieres evitar una agresi n sexual no uses ropa provocativa
9081182 las mujeres se visten as para fomentar el morbo de los hombres
9081183 qu honor con unas faldas abiertas hasta arriba y sentadas enfrente no me qued m s que mirar hacia arriba pero la vista es muy natural y las mujeres provocan

9081188 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9081189 it wasnt a georgian attack on tskhinvali that launched all of this
9081190 it was russian pressure over a long period of time and then shelling coming from south ossetians
9081191 was not a wise thing to do because as weve seen russia was prepared to launch a major invasion
9081192 today it is a fight between the civilized and the uncivilized worlds
9081193 the more information we have about the market the better we can make future markets
9081194 farmers markets build community and they need to be responsive that community
9081195 this is a way of engaging and involving the community the market serves
9081196 we might switch hours if people tell us its too early or too late
9081197 we get a lot of people that ask why dont have certain crafts at the market
9081198 and those are some of the concerns well address maybe for next years market
9081199 i think the balance is great between crafts and food
9081200 i think keeping it as a farmers market is very very important
9081201 it will help us local farmers to sell our produce
9081202 vladimir ilyich lenin ulyanov said at one point russia matters nothing to me what matters is to achieve world socialist revolution
9081203 estoy orgulloso por toda esta gente que se ha solidarizado y siento m s odio contra esta tiran a

9081209 este helic ptero para reservas vip y mucho menos reservas presidenciales por la antig edad que el mismo posee sin menospreciar el excelente trabajo que est realizando nuestro personal de mantenimiento
9081210 el documento original es el que presentamos aqu en la fiscal a
9081211 el helic ptero en realidad tuvo un incidente que no tuvo nada que ver con la falla de la m quina
9081212 la palabra vip utilizada en esa fecha fue porque ese helic ptero estaba asignado al presidente torrijos en ning n momento quise discriminar
9081213 solo quiero dejar claro que el helic ptero estaba asignado al presidente y por eso fue que recomend que no se utilizara para vuelos vip hasta tanto mantenimiento corrigiera y revisara la aeronave
9081214 el helic ptero fue revisado y fue puesto en vuelo que yo mismo realice
9081215 my biggest concern with the income data is that were getting off to a weak start to the third quarter
9081216 the income numbers are a reminder that the economy is going to look worse before it gets better
9081217 traditionally september is a weak month for stocks and i dont think were going to escape that
9081218 i do think we are going to stay in a trading range i dont see this market falling out of bed and going below the july lows
9081219 km0 es un estilo de vida vinculado a la eficiencia al territorio y al mercado de proximidad
9081220 adem s el viaje de ir a buscar los productos y la conversaci n con los cultivadores permite dedicar un tiempo a conocer lo que comemos y tal vez m s tiempo a cocinarlo mejor
9081221 de estas cosas han surgido los itinerarios del vino o de algunos productos locales y el consumidor vuelve a ser consciente de lo que come porque el sabor de lo que compra es diferente
9081222 solo unos precios bajos ayudan a competir con los organismos gen ticamente modificados ogm
9081223 si a principios del siglo pasado los italianos destinaban el 70 o el 80 de su renta a la comida ahora es solo el 19

9081225 a partir de las etiquetas no conocemos lo que comemos mientras que con los productos km0 lo sabemos
9081226 la hilera corta recupera una socializaci n que con las grandes superficies se hab a perdido
9081227 antes dice ramos cr ticos con la globalizaci n porque creaba un mercado plano se trataba de una lucha entre lo peque o y lo grande mientras que la novedad actual es que trabajando sobre el territorio y en relaci n con el consumidor promovemos la identidad y hacemos cultura
9081228 los precios altos son ahora una terapia para este nuevo concepto

9081231 takes a surprising turn away from what the conservative press would expect from head and his spiritual awakening and takes an in your face gritty but very honest look at the depths to which individuals will go to satisfy their drug alcohol addictions or other vices wrapped with footage of real life stories and overlayed with other innuendo heads performance steals the picture and will answer anyones questions as to whether he can still rock as hard or harder than his earlier days in korn the literal message in the final screen will get viewers thinking long and hard about any pre conceived judgments they have about those in society typically viewed as losers

9081239 the situation has still not really completely normalised and what you have seen is the effects of it start to seep through to all different sectors of the economy clearly the financial system is fundamental to the functioning of the market economy and as funds drying up have had an impact on firms there has also been a very great impact on consumers
9081240 i work best with deadlines and challenges in many ways i am a very linear organized list making type of artist but usually if i just go up to my studio and sit down at my sewing center or collage desk i can start creating pretty quickly getting to the studio takes some inspiration i will search the net look at art books and doodle ideas in order to get myself into the head space for studio time
9081241 come on we only have 30 minutes until the bell rings
9081242 but i know few artists can be forced to create on demand
9081243 came within zero feet vertical and one minute lateral separation at an altitude of 33 000 feet
9081244 the transaero 747 descended 200 300 feet 60 to 90 meters after receiving an alert from its traffic collision avoidance system
9081245 there is sound scientific evidence that using a cellphone while driving can be extremely dangerous
9081246 it greatly increases your chance of a serious road crash resulting in a hospital stay the consequences of serious collisions can last a lifetime as physicians we see truly tragic evidence of this every day in our practices
9081247 this is an important first step toward what we hope will be a full ban in the future
9081248 without early treatment and support mental health issues can persist throughout ones life i am confident this new plan will give albertas children and youth the opportunity to live to their full potential
9081249 all we feel is that if we have our questions answered we have the policemens version we will feel a little bit better
9081250 it still wont bring quilem back but if we have justice then maybe we will feel a little bit better
9081251 if they would have taken the time to use better judgment maybe the situation would have been different
9081252 were asking for a public inquiry to re evaluate the entire situation
9081253 we have to teach the police officers that the taser is not an inoffensive weapon
9081254 i think that until we have serious studies on intoxicated or sick persons that are conclusive the taser should also be considered as a weapon that can lead to death
9081255 nurses dont want to see moms and babies being sent out of the province for care so they want their units staffed adequately so they can provide care
9081256 eastern health has scheduled 14 mandatory overtime shifts at the neonatal intensive care unit for the next week alone while employers are entitled to mandate overtime if no other nurse is available scheduling it in advance as a solution to the nursing shortage is both inappropriate and unsustainable
9081257 while the employer will argue they may cancel the scheduled shifts if they determine they are not required these nurses are unfairly left hanging in the balance until the very last minute
9081258 we are continuing to alert the public given that the elderly people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women are at increased risk and are frequent patients at our facilities
9081259 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me
9081260 it has been my dream to play for this team my goal is to show the coaches i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9081261 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me
9081262 it has always been my dream to play for this team
9081263 my goal is to show the coaches that i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9081264 i am very happy my son will follow in my footsteps
9081265 hopefully he will have a long and productive career in new york i am proud of him and wish him nothing but success
9081266 obviously coming off a year with what we did last year the tendencies are to say that you want to keep all the same guys
9081267 but you know turnover in the league is night and day it happens every day in seconds but you dont want to lose guys veteran guys rookie guys or guys who you thought were going to contribute that didnt pan out
9081268 its always a good sign when its a difficult time making decisions on the 53
9081269 so you always want to be in that position you dont ever want to see a player leave but you also want the positions to be highly competitive
9081270 but i believe that its a process it isnt something that you wait until the final hour its ongoing
9081271 all of it im the general manager so if you want we can clear this out of the way this is not a joe girardi issue
9081272 i wonder if he cleared waivers and theyre trying to deal him

9081376 obama parte e talvez sintoma de um movimento c vico que veio sendo forjado para exigir uma mudan a na cultura pol tica do pa s para provar algo diferente
9081377 por defini o os conservadores n o gostam de mudan a mas os republicanos tamb m montaram nesse trem o senador e candidato republicano john mccain repete que inclusive bateu de frente com seu partido em nome da mudan a

9081383 to allow just any person to talk to the people hitler was such a good speaker that he swept away the germans with his oratory and we know what that led to

9081388 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
9081389 some days it covers everything with a white dust just like snow
9081390 were not happy campers but this is what we have to live with now do you stay and lose everything do you leave and then the vog stops the next day i dont know everyone thinks differently
9081391 am i worried yes im worried but what am i going to do
9081392 there isnt anything in history that is similar enough for us to use as a model for how to proceed
9081393 our general warning is more for people with chronic conditions that could be aggravated but everyone reacts differently to different levels of exposure so its very difficult to give a general emphasis
9081394 people need to monitor their own health and if they feel theyre beginning to have problems to remove themselves
9081395 one of the most difficult situations to explain to the public we dont know if there will be another volcanic event leading to still higher vog levels we dont know what the weather will be we dont know how particulate matter will be distributed we want to be able to give warning and precautions but its challenging back in july the levels rose as high as 9 parts per million but then dropped back down again within an hour hawaii civil defense the agency charged with alerting the public to extremely high so2 levels has a tough job they want to give people information in a timely manner but they also dont want to alarm people
9081396 the vog is better some days and worse other days
9081397 but even on light days i never have the feeling that when i inhale im getting a full breath
9081398 on bad days you can taste it in your mouth
9081399 but the last thing we want to do is cause panic
9081400 in any situation where people feel they arent able to do anything that becomes significant
9081401 weve seen chinese cabbage broccoli green onions and other vegetables showing damage there
9081402 they are making efforts at mitigating the effects of the sulfuric acid and some seem to be having at least partial success
9081403 the trade winds seem to carry the vog straight down to pahala and kau then it wraps around and just sits right on the farming areas of ocean view estates
9081404 you wont need that just look for the trees to start turning brown ocean view thats where the devastation is
9081405 most of these protea came in 17 or 18 years ago everything was great up until a few months ago
9081406 this was supposed to be my livelihood this was how i was going to support my wife and myself in our old age thats all gone now
9081407 im not one to want to throw in the towel
9081408 i want to help the farmers and until the time comes when they can no longer survive im going to try to help them as best i can but its a tough one
9081409 one of the challeges right now is trying to determine why obviously travel to the state is down and to the big island in particular but what part of that is attributable to vog and what to the larger economic problems
9081410 if the rest of the industry were booming and the big island wasnt that would be one thing towill says
9081411 not been a great deal of impact in fact at a number of properties guests were understanding and knew this was a natural occurrence not only is there not much we can do but for many of them the volcanic activity was one of the main reasons they came to the big island in the first place
9081412 the american kennel club akc announced today that the public has elected a poodle as their breed of choice for the obama family
9081413 the selection of governor palin is an insult to women she has obviously been chosen to appeal to female voters but she lacks both the experience and policy positions to serve as vice president of the united states
9081414 the announcement of governor palins selection on john mccains 72nd birthday highlights the fact that the vice president must be qualified to step into the presidency from day one sarah palin is a 2 year governor with zero foreign policy experience whose former position was mayor of a town of 9 000
9081415 to assume that women will simply support governor palin because of her gender is insulting in fact the governor is out of step with mainstream america on womens economic and social issues for example governor palin embraces john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade and protecting a womens right to make her own health care decisions
9081416 governor palin has also enthusiastically supported the bush mccain doctrine of standing up for big oil and failed economic policies that has led to a struggling economy
9081417 american women need quality health care for themselves economic security for their families an energy plan that will give us energy independence and a plan to bring our troops home from iraq responsibly

9081924 somewhere in you girl ive been looking for heaven baby see i spent my lifetime only to find heavens in you
9081925 i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards to this court
9081926 in other words your plea is one of not guilty to the indictment as a whole
9081927 may i hold you to your word that im not guilty
9081928 it is also obvious that the wartime leader of bosnian serbs the same as milosevic will base his defence on ideological and political grounds rather than on legal grounds
9081929 we cant blame everything that happened on one person five or even ten they are all guilty
9081930 as soon as somebody demonstrates the art of flying settlers from our species of man will not be lacking on the moon and jupiter given ships or sails adapted to the breezes of heaven there will be those who will not shrink from even that vast expanse

9081942 if a customer exceeds more than 250 gb and is one of the heaviest data users who consume the most data on our high speed internet service he or she may receive a call from comcasts customer security assurance csa group to notify them of excessive use
9081943 if comcast has oversold their network to the point of creating congestion problems then well disclosed caps for internet use are a better short term solution than comcasts current practice of illegally blocking internet traffic

9081953 in picking an unknown untested half a term woman governor from alaska to be his running mate john mccain is following in a long line of reckless men who have rolled the dice for a beauty queen except in this case mccain is taking one of the biggest boldest gambles in modern american political history
9081954 i just talked to my daughter who is in law school at tulane she is on her way to st louis because of the evacuation order and school is closed because of gustav but she said the locals down there are acting like its nothing to worry about the same attitudes before katrina hit they keep saying we only get hit by female hurricanes and we go years between hurricanes hitting the city fortunately they have a better governor this time though the same mayor
9081955 permission was not sought or granted nor would it have been given
9081956 please god give cecil cooper a modicum of restraint thanks
9081957 i wish i could be there i love watching people doing it their first time
9081958 i think the internet is going through puberty and that these are important times
9081959 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9081960 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house what does this say about his judgment
9081961 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9081962 sarah palins chief qualification for being elected governor was that she was not frank murkowski she was not elected because she was a conservative she was not elected because of her grasp of issues or because of her track record
9081963 when i first heard the choice i was pretty skeptical
9081964 its a desperate hail mary pass thats going to fall flat
9081965 shes going to energize conservatives and shake up the status quo which is exactly what this election is about it sends exactly the right message
9081966 obviously when the pick is unknown it depends how they perform on the first day i thought she did great
9081967 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm
9081968 i do not want to speculate but i am fearful that we could be looking at a number in the region of 10 in terms of the number of people who have died
9081969 the water is rising fast and there is widespread looting down here
9081970 the people are even stripping the material from one of the bridges it is awful
9081971 this is a race against time the international community needs to respond quickly before winter when conditions deteriorate
9081972 if the response is slow or insufficient people could be forced to sell assets or leave their homes and villages and there could be a further deterioration of stability
9081973 this seems to be the work of the gulf cartel
9081974 we will have to see where the heads turn up i am sure they will try something spectacular to shock society
9081975 to hell with this group thang is gonna get me some solo love
9081976 we know there were a lot of u s advisers in georgia but instructors teachers and personnel for military weapons should be on firing ranges and in the teaching centres but where were they they were in the zone of military operations
9081977 and that pushes one to the conclusion that the leadership of the united states knew about the action that was being prepared and moreover probably took part in it
9081978 if the leadership of the united states had sanctioned that then i have the suspicion that it was done specially to organise a small victorious war
9081979 and if it didnt work then to create from russia the appearance of an enemy and on that ground unite the electorate around one presidential candidate of course the ruling party
9081980 in a significant way the crisis was provoked including by our american friends in the course of the election struggle
9081981 this was the use of administrative resources in a deplorable way to provide advantage to one of the candidates in the current case from the ruling party
9081982 if european states want to serve the foreign policy interests of the usa then in my opinion they will gain nothing from this
9081983 a country in the current case russia which can stand up for the honour and dignity of its citizens defend their lives will not be isolated despite the bloc like thinking of our partners in europe or in the united states
9081984 the world doesnt end with europe or the united states
9081985 but i think any kind of reaction they would take to the eu would be in kind like visa restrictions or a business contacts freeze
9081986 i dont think the retaliation would include the kind of things like restricting oil
9081987 they are occupiers here they are occupiers all around georgia
9081988 john mccains choice of sarah palin as vice president is the best news for american families to come out of washington in a long time as a working mother gov palin obviously knows the challenges of balancing career with family and because of that im confident she will support family friendly policies that emphasize workplace reforms that reflect the way americans live and work in the 21st century
9081989 it means that the big boys are playing for keeps and will use their patent portfolio at any cost to crush and deter new entrants as a community it will take us a long time to recover from this mess
9081990 i dont at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back it makes me far too conceited
9081991 new water and old water in the 21 st century
9081992 encuentros 2008 a forum for university presidents on mexico u s relations and research initiatives
9081993 while the ua today is very adept at and committed to thinking and acting globally we recognize the importance of thinking and acting regionally as well
9081994 the ua comes here as the senior research university in a state that is well acculturated to approaching water with respect an eye toward conservation and an understanding that it defines virtually every aspect of our lives
9081995 well just relax at home barbecue in the back yard and that will be all for us
9081996 i really dont pay attention to tell you the truth because if you are going to drive you are going to drive
9081997 i havent met her before she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and you know im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans
9081998 unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at top of ticket as i indicated in my speech last night i think that he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him in in his policies
9081999 i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate
9082000 im pleased with my choice for vice president joe biden i think hes the man who can help me guide this country in a better direction and help working families
9082001 an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9082002 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9082003 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9082004 i think that campaigns start getting these uh uh hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9082005 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
9082006 you drive the car ill f ck him in the back seat
9082007 every day in the gulf coast league youre liable to see something youve never seen before

9082197 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
9082198 i have stopped using a false name so i think all parties should do the same
9082199 i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards this court

9082202 i am waiting to do a film where the protagonist is the villain im kind of done with the marvel hero what would be exciting to me and nobody has come to me with this yet is a film about a villain that were familiar with in marvel and showing his complexities
9082203 i have one in mind but i must keep it close to the vest
9082204 ive been lucky enough to create these characters onscreen im the stan lee of film so to speak
9082205 im excited ive been hoping for decades to see a woman on the republican ticket and governor palin was worth waiting for a reformer a seasoned executive and best of all normal and authentic great choice
9082206 im always pleased when a woman is given an opportunity for advancement i do think however that while senator barack obama showed impeccable judgment in his selection of senator joe biden who is someone who could step into the white house on day one should that become necessary i think you do have to question senator mccains judgment in selecting someone whose only experience really is having served as mayor of a small town of 9 000 and about one year in the governors office in alaska
9082207 john mccain has chosen wisely in selecting governor sarah palin as his running mate john mccain has again demonstrated his judgment and his commitment to conservative values fiscal discipline and reform
9082208 i had the opportunity to meet with gov sarah palin on my recent trip to anwr i found her to be very down to earth and personable she is a person who would feel at home in southern indiana she hunts and fishes and is pro life
9082209 sarah palins selection is an outstanding example of john mccains willingness to reach out to fresh voices embrace new leadership and continue the republican partys strong support of conservative women leaders
9082210 instead of choosing a running mate who has the experience to be a real partner in bringing change to this country john mccain made a political pick in an attempt to reverse the anxiety republicans are feeling about his campaign rather than reversing the anxiety working families have about their future and their childrens future
9082211 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
9082212 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
9082213 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
9082214 i feel a lot better now though because at least i know i will have a home to come back to
9082215 its like youve been slapped so hard in the past that you can almost still feel it i just know how much work it was rebuilding everything
9082216 wow sister you sure are strong to have five kids and a career
9082217 later in the day these folks will be singing the praises of who is waaaay more experienced and waaay more ready to be president than obama
9082218 knows more about how to create jobs than anyone else in both campaigns
9082219 shes the commander in chief of the alaska national guard and has a son whos going to iraq
9082220 as you can see no taxpayer money was used in the purchase nor was money taken from any other town program to finance the barlaco land purchase
9082221 the repayment of the long term bond will come from taxation
9082222 it was rightfully noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9082223 unites the gop gives conservatives a stake in the election and puts a real reformer on the ticket
9082224 mccain has chosen to balance his ticket with a principled conservative governor palins life story is one of sticking to principle she is living proof that a person can take on the corrupt political establishment including corrupt leaders in her own party and achieve great things
9082225 theres an old expression in politics go along to get along not this time the selection of sarah palin is one big kick in the pants to the corrupt establishment in both parties
9082226 congratulations to john mccain for hearing and responding to conservatives conservatives the base of the party have been listless but now nearly all will work enthusiastically for the mccain palin ticket in fact this is the most enthusiastic conservatives have been since the era for ronald reagan
9082227 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9082228 its very cool to have our team running so well to be on top of our game and its really fun to have somebody like kyle thats so fast
9082229 there have been a couple of races where its like either me or him and i think that brings out the best in a lot of people
9082230 for us its been a lot of fun like i said if it comes down to just him and i for the championship that would be fine but i have a feeling some of these other guys are gonna have something to say about that
9082231 besides that they have a little better race cars than us at sometimes then no not really
9082232 yeah theyve caught up to us the past few weeks but we finished second its hard to put that into trying to become any better
9082233 theres only one guy i guess that youre trying to beat the past two races but its that one guy thats going to haunt you the rest of the year all we can do is try to do our best and come up with some better packages to end the year out strong
9082234 i even joke around with guys with myself that carl is bff carl were best friends i dont believe its a rivalry i believe that we can still be friends and stuff like that and have that relationship on the racetrack
9082235 when ive won hes congratulated me and thats why all this stuff this week i kind of just got a chuckle out of it because i know deep down that what he says doesnt matter to me and what i say doesnt really matter to him what really matters is we race well on the racetrack so id say that well be fine
9082236 i dont think it means that if you get into another driver and spin him out then youre going to get suspended for a race
9082237 i think it has to do with the way that you got put on probation which is if you do the same thing that you did again then the repercussions for it are going to go up and that would probably be a suspension or something like that it means keep your post race antics down to a minimum
9082238 i just have to be a little extra careful not to let my emotions get the best of me
9082239 i did what i felt was best at the time and thats fine
9082240 the only bad part about it is just tearing up race cars when you dont need to
9082241 i couldve very easily drove off into turn three and doored him right in the left side quarter panel or something and spun him out
9082242 i didnt do that i tried to race him clean i tried to get back by him and i got bogged down a little bit by denny hamlin who got along side of me and we raced for a little bit
9082243 i never laid a tire mark on hamlin and got back by him and was just too late to try to run down carl i wouldve certainly liked to have tried to not touch him im not out there to try to move anybody
9082244 it wasnt me it was this mean nasty troll and im under so much stress

9082252 so the liberal olbermann was outraged that the aps babington had written in his analysis of the speech just off the wire that obama had tried nothing new and that his speech was lacking in specifics he read the first few paragraphs on the air lamented that it would be printed in hundred of newspapers on friday and concluded it is analysis that strikes me as having borne no resemblance to the speech you and i just watched none whatsoever and for it to be distributed by the lone national news organization in terms of wire copy to newspapers around the country and web sites is a remarkable failure of that news organization charles babington find a new line of work
9082253 sarah palin is young and telegenic and any attack on her lack of experience opens up the gop counter punch of attacking lack of experience when the he man woman haters club launches misogynistic attacks on palin and they have already begun it puts the gop in the position of supporting and defending women
9082254 well like hillary asked were you in it just for her

9082343 after trying to make experience the issue of this campaign john mccain celebrated his 72nd birthday by appointing a former small town mayor and brand new governor as his vice presidential nominee is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgement it shows political panic

9082347 because of fay the payload is going to be delayed getting out on the launch pad
9082348 if that happens well have to reassess launch dates accordingly
9082349 our defense was so good that we kept getting the ball back quickly
9082350 im very proud of our defense they flew around and made plays all over the place they tackled well and were in position basically the entire evening it was one of the best defensive games maybe the best weve had around here since ive been here
9082351 we were embarrassed offensively the entire first half but of course n c state was embarrassed the whole game
9082352 its not like we were the worst offense out there but anyway it was a struggle and were going to try to get better but dont ask me how unless we start blocking a lot better we have to keep practicing and trying
9082353 some of our guys cant wait until the snap and thats embarrassing
9082354 its very embarrassing as the head coach and offensive coach that i cant teach them to wait on the snap but well keep on trying hopefully someday we can
9082355 but it was frustrating for all of our offensive coaches im not putting it all on the offensive line the backs had some mistakes also in protection
9082356 we had a lot of good field position but we didnt make much happen
9082357 he was under pressure a lot a couple of throws he could have thrown better but we opened the gates on him about three times we didnt even touch the guy running straight at him it was pitiful im embarrassed to say im the coach after some of the things that happened out there
9082358 well make some changes if we have to were trying to put the best guys out on the field well see if they cant play a little bit better its embarrassing it really is thats tough on a quarterback i used to play quarterback even the winless tampa bay buccaneers didnt open the gates they might have been beat late or something but at least they got a piece of a guy i dont have the answer for it right now but were going to keep searching for it
9082359 he got us in field goal range one time he was a quarterback throwing out the basement cellar window last night thats hard to do
9082360 we had zero players in the training room when the game was over
9082361 that was amazing for a very muggy evening n c state had a few guys carried off the field were in good shape strength and conditioning coach mark smith got a game ball obviously conditioning was very important on our side
9082362 we made a few runs here and there and hit a few passes when chris smelley came in
9082363 we scored a few points smelley had better protection and we ran the ball better when he was in there he made some good decisions he played better than tommy last night
9082364 well make a decision later on who we think should start the game this week
9082365 well announce something a little later on you guys can do the odds thatll give you something to do for two or three days
9082366 he played a whole bunch in the second half i think it was middle of the second quarter when he first went in
9082367 well try to redshirt as many of those freshmen as we can
9082368 we had some good plays but we just didnt quite execute

9082377 im thrilled with the choice ive been doing a lot of research on sarah palin today i think she is a wonderful choice
9082378 i know three hillary lovers and they are thrilled with todays choice they told me they are voting for john mccain now
9082379 this could swing a big vote in his direction this could be a big favor for him
9082380 being a female im still not going to switch just with the female pick i like obama i like what he stands for

9082409 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9082410 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
9082411 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
9082412 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino

9082421 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9082422 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9082423 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9082424 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

9082483 if they want to win in november democrats have one task to accomplish this week snap out of it
9082484 somehow tentativeness and insecurity have infected a party that ought to be full of confident swagger its not that democrats dont like their odds of winning the presidency and boosting their majorities in both houses in congress its that they are even bothering to calculate and recalculate those odds

9082488 weve got a bunch of animals and we cant just up and leave them
9082489 this house is pretty strong and i think its stronger now than it ever was before
9082490 the blessing if there is one is that its a three day weekend
9082491 the storm is a long way off people have a lot of time
9082492 we try not to pull the trigger too early on evacuation because you dont want to have false alarms
9082493 the anxiety on the coast is palpable you could cut it with a knife
9082494 wednesday morning is when i noticed reservations being booked very quickly that morning within a two to three hour period i had 40 rooms reserved
9082495 i am experienced in the process of evacuation i understand the stress the frustration and the anxiety level of the guests we try to make them as comfortable as possible
9082496 all i really need to know about how to live and what to do and how to be i learned in kindergarten
9082497 theres more directed time and theres twice as much exposure it takes adjustment
9082498 i try to have them say goodbye at the classroom door the next day at the end of the hall and so on if theres a kid whos having a particularly hard time the other kids rally around him or her and the distraction is usually enough to dissipate their angst

9082506 after the current government is ousted we will propose a totally new political system with those corrupt guys prosecuted and we will have a clean and efficient political system
9082507 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
9082508 i think if he had choice to play in a first game it would be in a big game
9082509 everyone wants to look good it keeps everybody on their toes but the players are just happy to get good players amongst them
9082510 the two of them donovan and beckham are the two best players in the league right now in terms of what they can add at any time they strike from all angles and theyve got eddie lewis so its important for us to contain them keep them in their half and if they spring on us we have to have guys in position to cover all over the place
9082511 obviously well have a big crowd and that motivates players whatever team youre on
9082512 the galaxy will certainly be motivated to do well against us they obviously think theyll have an advantage with the fact that we played mid week and we did travel but its up to us to combat that by passing the ball well being ready to start when the whistle blows and concentrate on getting the job done
9082513 because he played for liverpool so it was nice obviously to be coached by him in the allstars ive heard really good things about him but when he was a player like i said i didnt like him because i was a man united fan its going to be nice to see him again tomorrow hes a very good coach hes done great here
9082514 were going to do the best we can to try and make the playoffs
9082515 certainly if youre any kind of mathematician it would look like our best chance is to finish third in the west as opposed to earning one of the last two spots at the moment were two points out
9082516 you have to stay confident and you have to keep the players up for the fight and up for playing games because when you do go through a tough time its all about sticking together as a team
9082517 its a very conservative cabinet which certainly has its thuggish elements
9082518 what it shows is how the right is beginning a return across europe
9082519 absolutely the most extreme person who has ever served in the european parliament
9082520 citizens rights human rights and fundamental rights including the protection of minorities
9082521 i dont think there will be a true punisher movie til they make a balls out nc 17 rated envision
9082522 to allow urgently needed humanitarian work to be carried out in the country
9082523 think that second life is a safe haven for your kids
9082524 definitely with jason johnson pev mal michael and rama all calling it quits its a big game for not only them but the whole footy club
9082525 theyve been great contributors for the whole time theyve been at our club and i think everyone will really do our best to make sure we pull out a win on sunday for them
9082526 everyone whos played with jason and pev and rama and mal for a long period of time was trying everything to get up to play in this game because they wanted to give them a good send off
9082527 but at the end of the day if your bodys not right you cant really get on the ground and i think they were disappointed they couldnt get out there
9082528 you dont really like to use injuries as an excuse as a footy club but weve had to use pretty much everyone on the list
9082529 i think this week everyone whos available is either playing or on the emergency list so were really cutting into our list there and trying to provide players to get out on the park
9082530 i didnt take advantage of her second serve i was making too many mistakes
9082531 i dont get anything of whos going to be no 1
9082532 for me the toughest player of the summer was dinara safina
9082533 they are coming on so strongly in the last months that there is no longer space for sastre
9082534 i have studied the course and on the map i see 7 8 finishes that suit the sprinters it will be difficult but my objective is to equal the three victories of last year
9082535 the lord gives and the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord
9082536 there is sound scientific evidence that using a cellphone while driving can be extremely dangerous
9082537 it greatly increases your chance of a serious road crash resulting in a hospital stay the consequences of serious collisions can last a lifetime as physicians we see truly tragic evidence of this every day in our practices
9082538 this is an important first step toward what we hope will be a full ban in the future
9082539 all we feel is that if we have our questions answered we have the policemens version we will feel a little bit better
9082540 it still wont bring quilem back but if we have justice then maybe we will feel a little bit better
9082541 if they would have taken the time to use better judgment maybe the situation would have been different
9082542 were asking for a public inquiry to re evaluate the entire situation
9082543 we have to teach the police officers that the taser is not an inoffensive weapon
9082544 i think that until we have serious studies on intoxicated or sick persons that are conclusive the taser should also be considered as a weapon that can lead to death
9082545 we are continuing to alert the public given that the elderly people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women are at increased risk and are frequent patients at our facilities
9082546 nurses dont want to see moms and babies being sent out of the province for care so they want their units staffed adequately so they can provide care
9082547 eastern health has scheduled 14 mandatory overtime shifts at the neonatal intensive care unit for the next week alone while employers are entitled to mandate overtime if no other nurse is available scheduling it in advance as a solution to the nursing shortage is both inappropriate and unsustainable
9082548 while the employer will argue they may cancel the scheduled shifts if they determine they are not required these nurses are unfairly left hanging in the balance until the very last minute

9082558 well sit down with jeff in the next couple of days
9082559 he was lively tonight it looked like he was playing for his life thats how i saw jeff
9082560 id like to talk to you about jeffs character around the footy club
9082561 hes very much a little bit of inner strength particularly for the aboriginal guys and also to his other teammates i cant speak highly enough of jeff as a player and im not talking about pre empting anything here but i think we just need to learn to appreciate what jeff farmer brings to the game
9082562 i think ive been clear on that i want josh to stay but you understand sometimes there are issues that players have to deal with josh is one of those
9082563 well do as much as we can to get josh to stay but if its beyond that then its out of our control
9082564 josh is not one of those guys that i have to add anything hes very astute and knows what he needs to do
9082565 for all the guys who weve got uncontracted at the moment they would be genuinely excited about what theyve seen tonight
9082566 its showing we are doing a lot of things right and the group is pulling together and coming a lot closer and theyre finding out a lot about each other more so than ever because its been forced upon us
9082567 if people give you a shelter you should take it
9082568 gustav could become a major hurricane near the time it crosses western cuba

9082570 oftentimes the chin is an overlooked part of the face and it can make a positive impact both in men and women in how they look
9082571 i was always interested in ceos its been known they tend to be taller than the average population theyre good looking well spoken people and i was curious that they might have stronger chins also
9082572 warren buffett in terms of the business world also john mack and on a softer chin would be bill gates his chin is a little soft but hes a self made man he wasnt hired for the job in terms of stars george clooney arnold schwarzenegger brad pitt they all have strong chins
9082573 and thats not something you can exercise to make bigger you either have it or you dont surgerys the only option if you dont
9082574 to give you a stronger impression and it also increases the distance under the chin to give you a cleaner look and minimize the double chin
9082575 theyre typically in there for life once theyre put in but if for some reason you decided you didnt like it short term after the surgery you could take it out ive rarely had to do that
9082576 ive seen a doubling in the last five years of people having chin implants sometimes itll be done in conjunction with a face lift or liposuction to minimize the double chin
9082577 why do i have to ride with mommy i dont like her driving
9082578 written by jerry beck included in the set is the new collectors edition of the oscar nominated film
9082579 because of social dangerousness thousands and thousands of cubans are in prison
9082580 his lawyer said he talked to the prosecutors and that a judge told them this was a political trial
9082581 that this was about an undesirable in the neighborhood who made songs with lyrics against the system against fidel and everything else

9082583 senator obama has failed to deliver on his promise to help me pay down my campaign debt in exchange for my support of his candidacy he assured me that he would aggressively pay down my debt in reliance on those assurances my supporters have raised more than 4 million for senator obama yet to date senator obama has only made 400 000 available to my debt reduction fund since he has reneged on his promises to me i do not expect him to deliver on any of his campaign promises to you
9082584 therefore i am withdrawing my support and i encourage my supporters all 18 million strong to offer their full support to senator mccain and sarah palin
9082585 in addition and more importantly my husband thinks that sarah palin is hot
9082586 reforming admissions policies would be a good place to start in stopping discrimination there are some faith schools that are 90 or even 100 funded by the tax payer and yet they only cater for or prioritise 5 per cent of the population
9082587 we need schools which embrace the diversity in our communities not schools which divide pupils and staff by faith all children regardless of their religion culture and family income should have equal access to the best possible education in a good local school
9082588 allowing schools to pick and choose pupils is not the best way to achieve this or to create young adults with the confidence and personal skills to live and work in our vibrant multi cultural society
9082589 signed up to a shared vision for promoting community cohesion through schools with a religious character
9082590 parents should be able to choose the type of education and ethos they want for their children faith schools are here to stay
9082591 the fact of faith schools is precisely what makes policies to promote fairness and inclusion vital by practicing selection on grounds of belief in admissions and employment some are given advantage over others this cannot be right nor is it what the public want according to polling
9082592 what we need is not the same old tired pro and anti faith schools debate but a fresh approach based on actual practices rather than dogma or favouritism a voice concerned with the needs of pupils schools and communities with community cohesion and inclusive schooling this is what the broad accord coalition is wanting to create

9082596 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad

9082599 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

9082603 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
9082604 when i realized there was a big need for it in this area for people who were missing new orleans we decided lets make a living out of it
9082605 its been a real gift to be able to give to these people that are missing this kind of cuisine
9082606 passengers in phuket have been accommodated if they havent been able to remain in their hotels that they were already staying in

9082612 his first act will be to fly over north korea and yell charlie im baaaack
9082613 should something that is not science be taught in a science class room
9082614 lotta people digging me down and not replying sucks to have to examine what you believe doesnt it
9082615 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9082616 i wont have religion as a litmus test or anybodys personal opinion on evolution or creationism
9082617 a prayer a prayer in a public school god has no place within these walls flanders is history
9082618 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9082619 in a 2006 gubernatorial debate the soon to be governor of alaska said of evolution and creation education
9082620 in science a theory is a testable model of the manner of interaction of a set of natural phenomena capable of predicting future occurrences or observations of the same kind and capable of being tested through experiment or otherwise verified through empirical observation
9082621 while running for governor of alaska palin advocated the teaching of both creationism and evolution in public schools 48 but the next day she said
9082622 i think we can all look forward to the time when these three theories are given equal time in our science classrooms across the country and eventually the world one third time for intelligent design one third time for flying spaghetti monsterism and one third time for logical conjecture based on overwhelming observable evidence
9082623 and whatever happened to separation of church and state in this country
9082624 pinpointed three crucial molecular switches that when flipped completely convert a common cell in the pancreas into the more precious insulin producing ones that diabetics need to survive

9082626 here you have a leader who has certainly been a mayor she has been a governor she has been a leader on things like energy independence shes fought the big oil companies
9082627 i think its a little more difficult for them to go after the barack obama people saying look barack obama doesnt have experience but the barack obama people can point back to their vice presidential pick
9082628 the idea that he thinks that john mccain thinks that that just selecting a woman regardless of her qualifications and regardless of her stand on issues of importance to women that women will follow him like sheep to the slaughter shows just how much he misunderstands whats going on
9082629 im always pleased when a woman is given an opportunity for advancement i do think however that while sen barack obama showed impeccable judgment in his selection of sen joe biden who is someone who could step into the white house on day one should that become necessary i think you do have to question sen mccains judgment in selecting someone whose only experience really is having served as mayor of a small town of 9 000 and about one year in the governors office in alaska
9082630 there is no amount of money that is going to make it right

9082633 those problems are specific to the us theres no way they could come here
9082634 yeah it would mean a lot for us to win on a big track like this
9082635 mile and a half and above tracks and downforce tracks have been kind of our weak spot
9082636 weve been making a lot of gains hopefully we made some gains that will help us this weekend and moving into the chase
9082637 it just started the confidence in our minds that were ready for the chase
9082638 the top five guys in the points have a very good point of view or mind set theyre going to be in the chase so youre looking at what you need to do to be as good as you can in the chase and building the confidence around yourself and the team that you can be a contender

9082643 bachelet promulga convenci n internacional sobre derechos de los discapacitados
9082644 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
9082645 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico

9082647 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado

9082657 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas

9082660 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
9082661 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina

9082663 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
9082664 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
9082665 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
9082666 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

9082698 a history of the lpnh nh ballot access issues and why this lawsuit is a mistake part 1
9082699 position specific things being in the right position communicating when you have an assignment to do just executing it its like the whole defense thats what we wanted to do individually everybody improved
9082700 we didnt do what we wanted to do what we set out to do last year as a group collectively and individually we had to do that improve
9082701 we harp on technique because thats what gets you in trouble you have to stay on them about that but its just like even if they were young
9082702 young or old you have to do the same reminders if youve got a guy thats pretty good then youre trying to make him great if youve got a guy thats not so good youre trying to make him an ok player so theres that constant battle that youre trying to improve the guys
9082703 like i tell those guys every day you get your respect by what you do and not by what people think
9082704 until we go out on the field and we smack guys around make plays on the ball tackle well communicate well dont give up big plays then you wont get any respect regardless of what people say right now youre going to be judged by what you do against san diego state and then michigan and then so on and so on
9082705 this year i think weve got more guys that we can play that we can kind of count on in a number of different of positions it gives us a lot more flexibility to do different things that we want to do so thats a plus
9082706 when i got knocked down by guys bigger than me she sent me back out and demanded that i bloody their nose so i could walk down that street the next day

9082714 it feels great to have signed for fulham football club these are exciting times at the club and ive joined to become an integral part of fulhams future success
9082715 the club has made some terrific signings over the summer adding to an already talented pool of players last saturdays win over arsenal shows just how competitive fulham are in the premier league
9082716 im looking forward to meeting up with my new team mates over the next few days settling down and preparing for the clubs next home game against bolton wanderers in a few weeks time
9082717 this is a crucial stage in my career and im delighted to have committed myself to fulham for what i hope will be my prime years as a professional footballer

9082745 people are confused and lethargic not simply because they are tired of hearing the gospel or because they have never really been emotionally gripped by it but also because they are confused they have not heard the gospel in a way that provokes a thoughtful basement to attic reappraisal of themselves and their world
9082746 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break
9082747 going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins shes gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie whos out of control

9082749 i want lindsay to be in a good place when i started looking at what samantha was doing dragging lindsay to clubs drinking around lindsay samantha is one of the biggest problems in her life
9082750 thats what dina told me im reacting on what dina said but then dina steps out of the picture because she wants to look like the good guy

9082761 if you enjoyed this post or the bulletin generally please consider buying me a pint august 2008
9082762 i dont really want to get into daily progress reports of how it went but it was something that we decided to do last week
9082763 were going to just keep progressing this weekend and going through next week and hopefully we can just keep feeling better
9082764 it was good to get back there doing the same things the rest of the guys were doing having to do rehab having to miss practice its not really the situation that you want to be in
9082765 so it was good to get back out there get in uniform be around the guys and hopefully that can be the sort of the norm from here on out
9082766 certainly ive been preparing for the season opener for some time from a film standpoint its good to get back out there on the field and do more physical activity
9082767 i feel i got in some good practices this week i thought that was important
9082768 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9082769 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9082770 its been kind of my goal the last month or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9082771 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations
9082772 its nuts i dont think theyve got it right quite yet
9082773 how can you have a double major winner not make the tour championship thats complete nonsense
9082774 it was one of the rare days it did feel like that
9082775 but it was one of those days with my putter i hadnt had in a while so it was fun
9082776 joey is in the squad ahead of schedule slightly hell be on the bench but common sense will prevail its may be a week or 10 days quicker than it should be but he might come on for 10 15 minutes im not talking about starting him
9082777 some people think he might get 15 games which sounds ridiculous but it wouldnt be unbelievable for him to get very few because hes already missed a lot of games because of the punishment hes had
9082778 we feel the americans have no intention of building the stadium
9082779 there is a lot of anger it does not just affect the liverpool fans but also the wider community regeneration is linked to the new stadium the best thing they could do is step aside for new owners to come in
9082780 it the stadium is not good news but we cannot change things
9082781 i understand very well our fans and what they may think but they will understand that i must concentrate on the next match
9082782 our commitment to building a new world class lfc stadium is undiminished
9082783 i would have loved to have been still in charge
9082784 if i could have afforded to take the club forward then i would have done but i didnt have the sort of money you need for a new stadium
9082785 every match day arsenal and manchester united take in between 2 5 3 million more than we do at anfield multiply that by 19 and they take in 50 million more than we do just by playing games and thats before you add in the champions league or domestic cups
9082786 the americans could still have raised the money had the club not had a hod load of debt placed on its shoulders by the takeover
9082787 arsenal raised 97 million by a 16 year naming rights deal but the royal bank of scotland has loaned 365 million to their company kop holdings whose only asset is liverpool fc its a sub prime loan
9082788 because there was no detailed evidence funds were in place
9082789 louis is a good centre forward who has a bit of everything he can run head the ball and score goals and he hasnt cost us any money
9082790 there will be some money after he has played some games but there is no initial outlay and he has to play before we pay he has had his injury problems but if he had been playing every game we wouldnt be getting him for next to nothing
9082791 if you speak to people who have worked with him they will tell you he is a top centre forward
9082792 what we need to do now is get him out there because he is fantastically talented and if we can get him involved a bit more than he was at united last season then he will certainly play his part for us
9082793 if i can get louis out there 20 times a season that would give us a chance of winning 20 games but he has had no pre season games so there is no estimate yet as to when he may play
9082794 the fundamentals have turned out to be worse than i had thought
9082795 i underestimated in almost every way how badly economic and financial fundamentals would turn out
9082796 events must now be disturbing to everyone and i for one am officially scared
9082797 the whole global economy will be weaker than the market expects for quite a considerable time
9082798 i would guess at least two years of sustained disappointment
9082799 if the global economy is going to disappoint the cost of holding them just seemed too high
9082800 i worry on behalf of the global economy at the consequences of china stumbling
9082801 the whole level of global imports and exports would start to drop
9082802 we will not provide long term capital to borrowers with unsound and unwise business management practices at unattractive real yields
9082803 we require a higher level of compensation i e more yield for these potential risks
9082804 hes not naturally the most optimistic person youll ever chat with
9082805 even in the best times hes looking for the gray lining in a silver cloud thats one of the reasons you invest with him
9082806 by my calculation he adds about two percentage points a year through market timing or varying his exposure
9082807 thats a big number when its added on top of the other returns youre getting some managers would kill for two extra percent
9082808 congress is already investigating allegations of manipulation in the oil market and it seems likely that it is only a matter of time before a similar investigation will be required in the precious metal markets
9082809 the data in the bank participation report is so clear and compelling that it is hard to conclude anything but manipulation
9082810 one can take any data and make it suit their argument
9082811 the theory that the market is somehow sinisterly manipulated especially as it comes at a time when u s regulators are keeping a keen eye on the goings on in the commodities and financial markets for just such type of evidence is simply ludicrous and totally out of touch with market reality
9082812 my gut feeling is that the republicans wouldnt mind taking oil back down under 100 before the elections
9082813 estamos abiertos a recibir todas las propuestas y a llegar a acuerdos enmarcando todas las conversaciones dentro de la visi n estrat gica que existe en el gobierno bolivariano sobre la soberan a que debe ejercer la naci n sobre un rea tal neur lgica como el combustible
9082814 esta consulta se suma a todas las reuniones que viene efectuando desde hace un tiempo con los sectores involucrados el ministerio de energ a y petr leos pues la iniciativa legislativa fue tomada por el ejecutivo nacional a trav s del consejo de ministros
9082815 la estrategia que del nean estos dos mandatarios es la que necesita am rica del sur los pueblos necesitan unirse defender su soberan a y demostrar que s podemos sostener a nuestras propias industrias

9082817 los venezolanos s podemos tener la sider rgica en las mejores condiciones porque los trabajadores perciben lo mejor de su planta

9082822 im just a passing christian who feels the need to crash your atheist party and say that i think that god exists and i think that you guys should rethink
9082823 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
9082824 whoever breaks one law is guilty of breaking them all
9082825 it is by grace that you have been saved through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of god
9082826 arizona voters will have a chance to vote on this important issue
9082827 no matter how helpful they have been the fact remains that our campaign and those who signed our petitions have been cheated
9082828 i know the reaction im going to get because ive been back to upton park nine or 10 times
9082829 but west ham will always have a place in my heart because i started there as a kid i love the club and the fans im a big man with broad shoulders so it never really affected me
9082830 it will be a proud moment to go back there 20 odd years down the line as a manager
9082831 if youre doing well at west ham theyre the best fans in the world if not you know what youre going to get im sure curbs is aware of the situation
9082832 if we score early we could turn the crowd against west ham but if west ham score first the fans will be chanting his name
9082833 i feel for curbs because people forget the fantastic job he did at charlton hes still a fantastic manager he has brought in some good players and been unlucky with injuries
9082834 some other top players perhaps wouldnt have gone there macclesfield but he got in there straight away
9082835 im pleased someone has been promoted from the lower leagues to the premier league his time is totally consumed by being a premier league manager thats what hes going to find its a massive call on you but we all love it
9082836 they have to realise the effect it has when theyre not behind us
9082837 if we are to see real progress decisive political action which encompasses the whole of sudan is needed
9082838 continue to be hampered by significant logistical challenges and insecurity
9082839 will hinge on the will of the parties to resolve their differences through dialogue
9082840 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9082841 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9082842 a good thing about the mausoleums is that caskets can be removed later if a family should come forth and want to bury them themselves
9082843 we decided not to look backward we decided to look forward with all the progress weve made
9082844 while we cannot say this is the source of the outbreak we also cannot rule it out
9082845 we see the well results as one piece of the puzzle and its my understanding that they the restaurant were only on well water for two hours of one day
9082846 i would like to have every one of those guys who attacked my farm go out with me to recover these animals and see the damage theyve done
9082847 these are done by underground activist groups who have a vested interested in remaining anonymous
9082848 mourinho is the most complete coach i have ever had on and off the pitch
9082849 you can see immediately the difference from other coaches theres a new spirit in the team the squad have an added confidence in their own abilities
9082850 when this team have had time to work together we will win games 2 0 and 3 0 not 1 0
9082851 i have only worked with the team for one month so we will get much better
9082852 we saw the ital nerazzurri end ital in the super cup and they are a battleship we will take them on showing the utmost respect
9082853 leaving the baby in the bushes like that if the baby hadnt been found it probably wouldnt have survived for long
9082854 the evil one is taking pictures of this right now
9082855 hes writing the commercial right now obama cant even run his own rally how can he run the country
9082856 they just thought everyone would come out here and line up nicely
9082857 freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one
9082858 in all things of nature there is something of the marvelous
9082859 we are trying to build a young vibrant team and he is going to be a big part of that we are trying to attract young players who will take us forward and who have a feel for the club it is not about a quick fix its about making the club stronger not only on the pitch but from within
9082860 and to top it off my kids are happy so that makes my day it felt like i had left home when i went to chelsea and now i am back
9082861 i have been stopped a few times by city fans and i always said i would like to return but i was never sure when
9082862 it has left the whole family in darkness this episode just because of some i dont know some foolish mistakes from some person
9082863 i have always had a plan to come back to australia and i still believe i have this option open
9082864 its just a matter of convincing my family it is very hard its my wife and my mother and my mother in law
9082865 he has been elected as the leader of the liberal party to take the liberal party to the next election and to win the next election and he will have my total and utter support in doing that
9082866 as far as im concerned the liberal party leadership is a team of dr nelson and julie bishop and im supporting them
9082867 i intend to keep on serving the people of higgins
9082868 neither a farewell or a resurrection its a thank you
9082869 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party
9082870 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
9082871 what dr nelson was referring to is that he would be very happy for mr costello to stay on in parliament
9082872 peter will of course announce in due course precisely what he intends to do and i look forward to it and as ive said so many times before if he chooses to stay in the parliament ill be very happy
9082873 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard has gone which is why so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly and understandably wavered in the aftermath of the election
9082874 im very hopeful that peter costello will come back hed be a great leader hed be a great prime minister
9082875 i want peter to stay in parliament who leads the coalition is a decision for another day
9082876 nobody ever objects when people say nice things about them
9082877 its very nice of tony to say nice things about me and i appreciate it very much hes an old friend of mine and i thank him
9082878 i hope he does stay on hed be the best thing for the country
9082879 i think whatever he chooses to do well support him in that because hes earned the right to make the decision he wants to make
9082880 dr nelson acknowledged the impressive contribution that peter costello made and i think the reception that he received inside the room was very favourable
9082881 im very sorry for terrible harm ive caused my children
9082882 i wish to humbly apologize to society for my crime i know human life is sacred and i took the life of a human being

9082885 there is no amount of money that is going to make it right
9082886 it is more an issue of validation and in that sense they feel validated
9082887 being 2 0 and 6 0 in sets is a great way to start the season
9082888 the seniors leadership and composure was key in todays two wins
9082889 also our sophomore setter did a great job leading and running the offense efficiently
9082890 see i told you obama should have picked hillary i knew mccain was going to pick a woman and obama is going to lose the election
9082891 the great and growing dryer state of arizona home of janet home of those wildcat devils home of mutant cacti and crazy politicians home of border crimes and border injustice proudly nominates

9082895 se trata del encuentro dem crata m s sostenible de la historia
9082896 this is a tough competition as there are sides who should be in the champions league i am sure lots of our fans were watching at home and are still pinching themselves we are in the uefa cup
9082897 i think it is going to be difficult because they are top of their league
9082898 they beat barcelona the other night so we will have to do very well at home to start with
9082899 it is a good draw and hopefully we can do the job in the first leg
9082900 we want a winning culture so all competitions are important
9082901 dood was als ik niet meer wakker was geworden en ik had het nooit geweten
9082902 this was a good match for us to open the season with
9082903 it was a great starting point and we were able to see what people were able to do
9082904 northwest missouri challenged us more the girls played with character and didnt give
9082905 if we keep playing like this we will have a great season
9082906 hey why dont you put a cello neck on that thing
9082907 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9082908 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9082909 im sure that she will help make the case for republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket
9082910 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the

9082917 it is really time for us to move out of this era of south african one day cricket we have got to start moving forward before the next world cup we have got to re evaluate the personnel and start a new era
9082918 everybody is under serious threat and they need some big performances
9082919 we have got some very young players who we need to get out there and expose them we want the youngsters to put their hands up and stake a claim for their places in the team
9082920 i am disappointed but not surprised at how england have outplayed us in all three disciplines every meeting we have we have hammered home basics basics basics but we have not taken it into the games
9082921 it would be unfair just to blame our batters the bowling has been below par and we have been below par in all three disciplines
9082922 i have come out of a dressing room that is a little bit down in confidence and we have got to bring these guys forward quickly starting at lords on sunday that could be the starting point of a new south african one day side
9082923 there are no excuses we had five different guys coming in so there was a change of personnel and a change of energy this is not an excuse but after the oval test we had a long time together not doing a huge amount
9082924 but we have been outplayed by a very strong england team
9082925 i didnt want to take it any more i wanted to know why people were dying
9082926 i understand that they are afraid but why would a doctor prescribe something that could potentially cause them die how does that benefit us

9082934 lets face it not everyone always agrees on all of the issues but when you come together like that you do have a common goal and our common goal is to elect a republican president and vice president
9082935 if youre a young employee starting out you have a family you have children to feed you have other costs gas those things all add up
9082936 i sympathize with the employees and i think its great to try to look after them but were looking at taxpayers money here and we have to use it wisely
9082937 this is one race of people for whom psychoanalysis is of no use whatsoever

9082947 the democrats will attempt to project the issue as whether a woman can be vice president a point the republicans can cheerfully concede returning to the question of whether this woman in particular should be the vice president mrs ferraro is manifestly an affirmative action nominee she has been in the house only since 1979 and cannot be said on the record to be as qualified to be president if necessary as say john glenn fritz hollings mo udall or george bush
9082948 i believe that someday we are going to have a woman president possibly during my life and ive often thought the best way to pave the way for this was to first nominate and elect a woman as vice president but i think mondale made a serious mistake when he picked geraldine ferraro as his running mate in my view he guessed wrong in deciding to take a congresswoman that almost nobody had ever heard of and try to put her in line for the presidency i dont know who among the democrats might have been a better choice but it was obvious mondale picked geraldine ferraro simply because he believed there was a gender gap where i was concerned and she was a woman

9082970 nobody has ever attempted to kayak to the pole before in fact it would have been impossible last year because it was frozen over
9082971 its a very long way across an ocean that is so cold and with high winds recently when i was up there training i was wearing a wet suit and a dry suit and i was still freezing cold
9082972 the stress of the 20 minute swimming at the north pole was extreme
9082973 but he knew it was 20 minutes and then it was over the stress here is less for every session but he is going to have two or three weeks of paddling and thats going to be very very demanding
9082974 theres one side of me that desperately wants to get to the north pole to be able to shake the lapels of world leaders to get them to understand what has happened there
9082975 by giving them techniques to manage their own behaviour we can give them robust practical solutions rather than punitive ones it takes sophisticated thinking
9082976 were saying to these children you have a chemical and neurological challenge and need some techniques to manage yourself better
9082977 it is not an argument for absolving kids from responsibility but equipping them to take responsibility with techniques to balance their emotions
9082978 the fantasy of politicians is that the public is not intelligent enough to hear this i disagree once you explain it to them the public is deeply appreciative because it makes sense
9082979 where do these kids learn that life is so worthless they learn it as they grow up and see no one comes to save them from abuse and neglect
9082980 life should mean life you go to prison and you dont come out
9082981 on one level i agree with her because the message has to get out that human life is precious and no one has the right to take it away
9082982 but also the message should be that because human life is precious it should be protected against abuse
9082983 unfortunately it is cowardice on the part of the government they feel they will not win an election unless they pander to the popular belief that these kids are evil they feel theyre going to win votes on it
9082984 we have long recognised that early intervention is critical in breaking the cycle of abuse neglect poverty and violence
9082985 this is why over the past decade weve focused on developing integrated services for families from disadvantaged backgrounds and those who may need additional support

9082992 your hen go over to the house i live 26 textile drive
9082993 its very cool to have our team running so well to be on top of our game and its really fun to have somebody like kyle thats so fast
9082994 there have been a couple of races where its like either me or him and i think that brings out the best in a lot of people
9082995 for us its been a lot of fun like i said if it comes down to just him and i for the championship that would be fine but i have a feeling some of these other guys are gonna have something to say about that
9082996 besides that they have a little better race cars than us at sometimes then no not really
9082997 yeah theyve caught up to us the past few weeks but we finished second its hard to put that into trying to become any better
9082998 theres only one guy i guess that youre trying to beat the past two races but its that one guy thats going to haunt you the rest of the year all we can do is try to do our best and come up with some better packages to end the year out strong
9082999 i even joke around with guys with myself that carl is bff carl were best friends i dont believe its a rivalry i believe that we can still be friends and stuff like that and have that relationship on the racetrack
9083000 when ive won hes congratulated me and thats why all this stuff this week i kind of just got a chuckle out of it because i know deep down that what he says doesnt matter to me and what i say doesnt really matter to him what really matters is we race well on the racetrack so id say that well be fine
9083001 i dont think it means that if you get into another driver and spin him out then youre going to get suspended for a race
9083002 i think it has to do with the way that you got put on probation which is if you do the same thing that you did again then the repercussions for it are going to go up and that would probably be a suspension or something like that it means keep your post race antics down to a minimum
9083003 i just have to be a little extra careful not to let my emotions get the best of me
9083004 i did what i felt was best at the time and thats fine
9083005 the only bad part about it is just tearing up race cars when you dont need to
9083006 i couldve very easily drove off into turn three and doored him right in the left side quarter panel or something and spun him out
9083007 i didnt do that i tried to race him clean i tried to get back by him and i got bogged down a little bit by denny hamlin who got along side of me and we raced for a little bit
9083008 i never laid a tire mark on hamlin and got back by him and was just too late to try to run down carl i wouldve certainly liked to have tried to not touch him im not out there to try to move anybody

9083027 obama spent the final days of the supreme court term celebrating conservative constitutional outcomes rather than calling out dubious conservative methodology who was better situated to chide the courts conservatives for what sure seems to be an activist ruling that saved exxon 2 billion in damages stemming from the valdez oil spill
9083028 it is tragic that so many alaska fishermen and their families have had their lives put on hold waiting for this decision

9083032 we looked tentative at times but we eventually pulled it together
9083033 heather meyers played really well and neticia enesi gave us a big boost early offensively and hit 800 in the first game the loss in game three was largely because of my mistake on the lineup card that put our hitters in the wrong spots on the floor nmsu sensed that and took advantage of that emotionally i thought our team showed good confidence in the fourth set and really played well

9083060 i suffer from stress induced clinical depression and i think my night eating is symptomatic of my mental state the more stress there is in my life the more often i wake up im supposed to be losing weight so raiding the carbs in the middle of the night doesnt do much for my self esteem
9083061 people affected crave sugary and starchy food which can have a soothing effect we dont call these types of food comfort food for nothing explains susan ringwood beats chief executive
9083062 night eating syndrome often emerges at times of emotional stress it becomes a way of coping a form of self medication but in the long term it may add to this distress with feelings of guilt and shame at uncontrollable eating urges related weight gain may in turn make sufferers feel shameful and uncomfortable
9083063 it often occurs in stressed career women i remember one successful executive who was very controlling about her daytime eating but went to sleep with a bowl of sweets next to her bed for dipping into during the night

9083070 no es presi n estar en el grupo m s complicado
9083071 es cierto que al equipo le han salido bien las cosas y que tenemos un buen balance recientemente pero tambi n estamos conscientes de que a n falta mucho camino por recorrer es por eso que ahora que nos hemos colocado en los primeros lugares del grupo debemos seguir trabajando como desde nuestra pretemporada es decir que no podemos bajar los brazos ni echar campanas al vuelo por el hecho de que hemos ganado gran parte de los partidos
9083072 m s que tomarlo como presi n se tiene un gran compromiso por sumar todos los puntos posibles para poder conseguir nuestra primera meta que es la liguilla y posteriormente estar en la pelea por el campeonato
9083073 la gente cuando venimos a la capital nos recibe bien estamos lejos de ellos pero cuando venimos siempre nos apoyan mucho y bueno nos quedamos con ellos para charlar un rato

9083077 realmente es un equipo cruz azul al cual se le puede hacer da o en el primer tiempo creo que hay que aprovechar con inteligencia y con orden pienso que necaxa tiene armas suficientes para poder ganar ma ana
9083078 la insistencia la actitud que muestran en cada partido es parte de las caracter sticas que tiene necaxa el equipo cuenta con jugadores de gran desequilibrio y con una gran actitud que puede darnos el triunfo ma ana
9083079 tengo amigos en cruz azul es bueno siempre encontrarlos nuevamente pero cuando empiece el partido va a terminar la amistad y va a pesar la competencia cada uno va a dar lo mejor para su equipo
9083080 ser realmente dif cil hace un a o la gente pensaba que ser a un grupo f cil pero acabamos teniendo que ganar nuestros ltimos tres partidos para clasificarnos

9083082 la afici n es realmente buena siempre anima al equipo y le ofrece su apoyo as que ser un encuentro duro en el calder n para m es el grupo m s dif cil

9083114 he tenido mucha participaci n que es muy importante para m
9083115 cuando un rival viene dolido es m s complicado nosotros hemos tenido un gran funcionamiento y eso es ventaja para llegar el d a de ma ana contra atlante nada m s se debe de seguir con el mismo funcionamiento din mica y orden en base a eso se puede sacar el resultado
9083116 ahora m s que nunca debemos de estar unidos porque en los momento malos siempre lo estuvimos y ahora con mayor raz n es cuando m s se disfruta estar en lo alto de la tabla general hay que sacar lo mejor de ello de c mo est el grupo y reflejarlo en el terreno de juego
9083117 he tenido mucha participaci n que es muy importante para m ya tuve la oportunidad de debutar en la copa sudamericana y tambi n es una experiencia en lo personal y sentirme mejor para el torneo local
9083118 la ventaja de los j venes es el tener el fogueo en torneos internacionales y afortunadamente se me dio hay que sacarle el mayor provecho para seguir creciendo como futbolista
9083119 es ventaja pues el equipo est m s motivado de seguir en la tabla de arriba para los rivales es desventaja pues se les complica sabemos que somos un rival dif cil de vencer hemos dejado de ser un equipo chico los n meros ah est n que son los que nos avalan
9083120 los partidos de aqu en adelante van a ser m s complicados los equipos ya se han acoplado bien y el sacar puntos va a ser m s dif cil pero el equipo lleva una buena inercia y esperamos conseguir la mayor cantidad de puntos
9083121 de ninguna manera pesa el buen paso nunca va a pesar al contrario preferimos estar en esta situaci n antes que remar contra corriente hoy el equipo va bien sin tampoco obsesionarnos con el liderato trabajamos d a con d a y partido por partido
9083122 es un equipo que suma mucha gente al ataque aunque tienen a luis gabriel rey y giancarlo maldonado que son los que apuntalan la delantera pero tiene jugadores que llegan de atr s muy bien y son los que ahorita est n convirtiendo por eso es que hay que tener cuidado de todo el funcionamiento del atlante
9083123 nos adaptaremos a la circunstancias que sea y solamente esperemos que se pueda jugar bien al futbol
9083124 hemos tenido una carga importante pero este tipo de concentraciones nos ayudan a recuperarnos en ese sentido as es a cualquier futbolista si le preguntas que si le gusta jugar o entrenar te van a decir que es la primera opci n para eso estamos en este momento no es un motivo para preocuparnos
9083125 indeed one might say that as far as the doctrine of justification
9083126 it he editors decided to retain the traditional text in the body of the new testament
9083127 the nkjv is an update of an historic version translated from a specific type of text
9083128 but polycarp also was not only instructed by the apostles and conversed with many who had seen christ but was also by the apostles in asia appointed bishop of the church in smyrna whom i also saw in my early youth for he tarried on earth a very long time having always taught the things which he had learned from the apostles and which the church has handed down
9083129 those who are particular about words and devote their time to them miss the point of the whole picture
9083130 for what participation has justice with injustice or what fellowship has light with darkness
9083131 why was our father abraham blessed was it not because he acted in righteousness and truth prompted by faith
9083132 when god rewards my labors he only crowns his own works in me
9083133 let your works be deposits so that you may receive the sum that is due you
9083134 but he who endures to the end will be saved
9083135 knowing that you are saved by grace not because of works eph 2 5 9 9 namely by the will of god through jesus christ
9083136 for he who raised him from the dead will raise us also 2 cor 4 14 1 cor 6 14 rom 8 11 if we do his will and follow his commandments and love what he loved 1 john 4 11 12 refraining from all wrongdoing
9083137 each man goes to everlasting punishment or salvation according to the value of his actions
9083138 the matters of our religion lie in works not in words
9083139 for abraham was declared by god to be righteous not on account of circumcision but on account of faith
9083140 they keep silent with regard to his judgments and all those things which will come upon those who heard his words but have not done them for it would better for them if they had not been born
9083141 rightly then to those who have believed and obey grace will abound beyond measure
9083142 the same from the foundation of the world is each one who at different periods is saved and will be saved by faith
9083143 those who are justified by faith in christ and not by the law to have peace with god
9083144 for man drew death upon himself by disobeying so by obeying the will of god he who wants to can procure for himself life everlasting bk ii ch xxvii
9083145 it is those who not only believe but also enter upon the life that jesus taught
9083146 assuredly then whoever believes in god and lives in faith is found righteous and is already blessed in faithful abraham
9083147 the spirit must earn immortality by the works of righteousness
9083148 indeed one might say that as far as the doctrine of justification
9083149 indeed one might say that as far as the doctrine of justification is concerned if you are not on the road to wittenberg or geneva then the old proverb is indeed true all roads lead to rome
9083150 well he was not dutch but ill guess hell do
9083151 god has brought us where we are to consider the work we may do in the world as well as at home
9083152 it was a no brainer dale jr is my hero
9083153 the navy came to me four years ago and offered to sponsor a car and help me achieve my goal of being an owner
9083154 they inspired me to create my race team and understand my goal and vision they even had the same formula that we have to work with in nascar for success as the navy does in recruiting and training you guys they thought an interesting way for recruiting was to create a division for me to sponsor and i was really excited about it
9083155 im a nascar fan and this is just an honor for me to be included in one of his divisions
9083156 i thought it was really a great thing for him to come here
9083157 it was great being enlisted by him but having him come here and visiting with us is really a boast to our morale
9083158 its a huge honor for me to be here and knowing the huge sacrifice you are making committing to the military
9083159 its really powerful to me knowing that you are making this commitment to the country and looking at you i can see youve got a great group and its very personal to me to see it happening from the very beginning
9083160 i didnt know he was from north carolina and it really makes me want to stay here and make him proud of his divisions
9083161 its an honor and it was fun having him come to see each of his divisions and i hope it spreads throughout recruiting to get good people in navy
9083162 the rdcs recruit division commanders of these divisions have more hall of fame division flags than anyone and were going to work to make sure that these divisions will make dale jr and the navy proud
9083163 were not here to make these recruits ready for a pit crew were here to make them sailors and ready for the navy
9083164 i have been preparing for it all my life a chance to race in nascar on a national level randy moss and david dollar have given me a wonderful opportunity for my first start in the ncts
9083165 i would like to thank whur for their belief in my talent and for coming on board to support my debut in the truck series
9083166 marc is one of the talented young drivers with a very bright future
9083167 he is a great fit with our team and brings an already impressive racing resume at such a young age
9083168 this is why i came to nascar this is a pretty cool deal marc has worked hard and raced his way up to this level im glad i have the opportunity to help him develop and succeed
9083169 vi que estaban hablando con un vigilante pero pens que le conoc an
9083170 no one wanted to take me to the last two

9083173 there were environmental groups working with mayors up and down the lake michigan coast saying weve got to do this
9083174 and those pressures eventually brought people to the table to move it forward
9083175 im just to the point where i feel confident to get into short sales

9083179 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
9083180 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
9083181 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
9083182 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
9083183 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
9083184 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
9083185 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
9083186 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
9083187 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
9083188 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its

9083214 theres a lot of people relying on that type of information in order to be safe and secure these corrections workers they want to go home to their families at the end of the day just like we do
9083215 were here today to say that there was a communication problem at that jail
9083216 if what the minister is saying is accurate that management knew 10 days in advance there was a serious breakdown of what should have happened there as far as the information going from management down to the workers on the floor
9083217 when they got that information they should have instituted a lock down immediately and went through the facility
9083218 i dont want to see somebody killed because somebody isnt doing what they have to do to make these places safe he said
9083219 these searches are being undertaken to ensure the safety of the public and the safety of all corrections workers
9083220 facility directors have been instructed to call in all staff required to complete this task as quickly as possible
9083221 when the evidence comes out it will be clear to everyone that this was not a rational policy decision that was taken but a spur of the moment reaction by the minister without considering the consequences
9083222 i hope that people will pay attention and i think its more likely that they will in the middle of an election campaign to the fact that weve had to go to court to try to force the government to do what we believe they have an obligation to do to protect a canadian citizen at risk of the death penalty

9083243 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9083244 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9083245 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low
9083246 its been kind of my goal the last moth or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9083247 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations
9083248 its nuts i dont think theyve got it right quite yet
9083249 how can you have a double major winner not make the tour championship thats complete nonsense

9083260 well sit down with jeff in the next couple of days
9083261 he was lively tonight it looked like he was playing for his life thats how i saw jeff
9083262 id like to talk to you about jeffs character around the footy club
9083263 hes very much a little bit of inner strength particularly for the aboriginal guys and also to his other teammates i cant speak highly enough of jeff as a player and im not talking about pre empting anything here but i think we just need to learn to appreciate what jeff farmer brings to the game
9083264 i think ive been clear on that i want josh to stay but you understand sometimes there are issues that players have to deal with josh is one of those
9083265 well do as much as we can to get josh to stay but if its beyond that then its out of our control
9083266 josh is not one of those guys that i have to add anything hes very astute and knows what he needs to do
9083267 for all the guys who weve got uncontracted at the moment they would be genuinely excited about what theyve seen tonight
9083268 its showing we are doing a lot of things right and the group is pulling together and coming a lot closer and theyre finding out a lot about each other more so than ever because its been forced upon us
9083269 a lot of self belief has been gained by a lot of players
9083270 definitely with jason johnson pev mal michael and rama all calling it quits its a big game for not only them but the whole footy club
9083271 theyve been great contributors for the whole time theyve been at our club and i think everyone will really do our best to make sure we pull out a win on sunday for them
9083272 everyone whos played with jason and pev and rama and mal for a long period of time was trying everything to get up to play in this game because they wanted to give them a good send off
9083273 but at the end of the day if your bodys not right you cant really get on the ground and i think they were disappointed they couldnt get out there
9083274 you dont really like to use injuries as an excuse as a footy club but weve had to use pretty much everyone on the list
9083275 i think this week everyone whos available is either playing or on the emergency list so were really cutting into our list there and trying to provide players to get out on the park
9083276 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion

9083286 as children are the true essence of our future the importance of providing them with the most basic right of having a safe and happy childhood can not be underestimated
9083287 children use the internet and their mobile phones to send harmful messages which marginalise children and can have devastating consequences
9083288 as with bullying cyber bullying can lead to social isolations for those effected by it to a point where they can feel at the edge of their social network and at the very worse of cases at the edge of life
9083289 its frightening to know that 20 per cent of children online will be targeted by an online predator or pedophile each year
9083290 and alarmingly most children dont tell adults about it for fear of losing access to their telephone or internet
9083291 the new problem of cyber bullying has become something of an epidemic
9083292 it requires therefore all of us at the level of being parents at the level of community leadership at the level of political leadership to work together against a problem which now knows no geographic frontiers
9083293 no child in any playground in any classroom in any school in australia should at any time fear for themselves or their safety or for their dignity

9083300 we are not troublemakers will not create problems but we will not accept any infringement on the constitution and law
9083301 we hope that there is no crisis between the governments of baghdad and erbil on empowering security forces to impose control over the khanaqin the iraqi file it is not likely hot new crisis erupted
9083302 demands great flexibility to absorb tension khanaqin the problem was resolved when officials of the two governments agreed on the withdrawal of kurdish brigade peshmarga beyond diyala leaving responsibility for security there to iraqi army
9083303 we believe that the convention must achieve full sovereignty of iraq and full withdrawal by a specific date and that during the temporary presence of foreign forces must be a mandate or trusteeship in all aspects of iraqi security operations or arrests or judicial authority pointing to the existence of a controversial point on judicial immunity while other issues are less controversial

9083307 mr considers the importance of elections and the necessity and importance of national consensus was discourse of the most fighters in the invitation to previous elections and the principle of elections is a fundamental principle of friendly

9083309 we are close to the election law before the adoption of the adjournment after healing the council on the ninth of september next will be the council every effort in this matter
9083310 no doubt there are disagreements unconstitutional because the constitution fair to interpretations and opinions and differences in viewpoints and there are concepts and intellectual backgrounds vary within the government with the kurds and the solution is through negotiation and dialogue especially since the constitution has a clear path in all matters in terms of the powers of the federal government local governments regions and the territorial boundaries and limits of the federal government

9083450 i guess theres a lot of uncertainty but thats just part of the game you just kind of have to focus on doing your job what you can do each day controlling the things you can control and not worry about the things you cant
9083451 we need big play from those guys we need leadership and for them to do the things that they had done all last season
9083452 our expectation is that our offensive line will play well
9083453 were going to have those big guys come up the field at him
9083454 were fortunate to have some athletic ends that we think can run as well
9083455 hes just a tremendous athlete hes just a guy were really going to have to key on
9083456 were really not sleeping on them at all you know with the upset win last year which coach miles mentioned to us a few times
9083457 this is going to be a real good test for us because theyre going to come out and throw the ball at least 40 times
9083458 its a way for the secondary to make a name for ourselves in the first game
9083459 the michigan game was really a wake up call for us
9083460 we did not stop them the whole day they were up and down the field now when you go into the offseason at least you have something to point to when guys start thinking about how good they think they are
9083461 all you had to do is just turn on the film and just say hey guys lets just go back to last season and lets look at that and well see how good we really think we are
9083462 they do throw the ball around a lot and we do need to improve
9083463 this game just because of what happened last year is going to be an early test for us
9083464 every time you pick up the paper everyone is saying this team will go as their defense goes
9083465 our players are taking hold of that i dont know if itll be a rallying cry or what but i just know this theyll play a lot better than they played last year
9083466 filipino rules super crew americas best dance crew season 2
9083467 would create risks to national security that far outweigh any potential benefit to be gained by providing the aclu with access to the requested records
9083468 reach beyond the governments procedures and conduct a facial review of the constitutionality of the statute
9083469 should not be deciding important constitutional issues in secret judicial opinions issued after secret hearings at which only the government is permitted to appear
9083470 the same men who came for you today as an escort will come for you tomorrow as a firing squad
9083471 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
9083472 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
9083473 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
9083474 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
9083475 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
9083476 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
9083477 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
9083478 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
9083479 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
9083480 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
9083481 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
9083482 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
9083483 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
9083484 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
9083485 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
9083486 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people
9083487 be the change that you want to see in the world
9083488 youre going to see a lot of people who are extremely skeptical it would seem that you would need a little more time

9083510 gov crist is doing a great job i think it was a great boost to florida that he had been on the short list for a while but ultimately the choice was up to senator mccain
9083511 i think it was a brilliant choice he picked someone outside of washington who could energize the ticket
9083512 congratulations to john mccain and the republican party for putting a woman on the ticket only 24 years after the democrats did thats less time than it usually takes them to catch up
9083513 and too bad that the republicans also imitated the democrats in coming up with a grossly under qualified woman especially now when there are some fully qualified alternatives
9083514 up to five million afghans face severe food shortages yet the appeal for afghanistan has a huge funding shortfall with less than a fifth of the 404 million us dollars needed to respond
9083515 large parts of afghanistan are facing crisis as a result of the cumulative effect of factors including the harsh winter high food prices drought and increasing and spreading insecurity
9083516 as it is almost impossible to deliver aid to rural areas during the harsh afghan winter concerted action is needed now to avert the crisis
9083517 this is a race against time the international community needs to respond quickly before winter when conditions deteriorate
9083518 the health of one million young children and half a million women is at serious risk due to malnutrition
9083519 we believe the current situation requires a major humanitarian response

9083528 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
9083529 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
9083530 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
9083531 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
9083532 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
9083533 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
9083534 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
9083535 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
9083536 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
9083537 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

9083543 all we feel is that if we have our questions answered and we have the policemens version we will feel a little bit better

9083546 we have to ask for justice thats the only thing we can do right now and thats what quilem would have wanted
9083547 im a christian i dont keep anger in my heart but this has been devastating blow for myself and our family he was our only son
9083548 no one deserved the fate quilem experienced no matter what theyve done in life if a police officer is there to do their job their first objective is to protect and to analyse a situation before intervening
9083549 difficult to believe the taserings played no role in his death
9083550 mr registre was first received at sacr coeur hospital as a traffic accident victim who was intoxicated
9083551 the treating physicians deplored the fact they had been given so little details on the use of a taser and mr registres condition beforehand
9083552 i therefore have no explanation why the use of other forms of force rather than the taser were insufficient or inefficient
9083553 i had no access to the process of their decision making nor any details on their strategic thinking we can ask if there was another way other means of subduing mr registre and calming him since he was visibly agitated one would think back up could have been called in ambulance technicians in particular since this was a medical emergency even if mr registre did not pull a gun was the fact he didnt respond to an order to raise his hands sufficient reason to immediate resort to the taser

9083637 obama gave a great speech of course i wanted a woman i would have liked to see hillary be the candidate
9083638 thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
9083639 if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
9083640 if he felt he was gaining weight hed work out as hard as he could to drop it
9083641 not completely sure of his place in this world because of his very complicated past but hes eager to find it and not afraid to fight for it when he does hes a born leader
9083642 whilst the candidate clearly expressed enthusiasm and passion and has some of the personal qualities that are well suited to this role the panel agreed that at this stage in his her career he she has not yet had the range and depth of experiences necessary to fulfill the duties of this role at this level

9083657 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9083658 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house what does this say about his judgment
9083659 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9083660 sarah palins chief qualification for being elected governor was that she was not frank murkowski she was not elected because she was a conservative she was not elected because of her grasp of issues or because of her track record
9083661 when i first heard the choice i was pretty skeptical
9083662 its a desperate hail mary pass thats going to fall flat
9083663 shes going to energize conservatives and shake up the status quo which is exactly what this election is about it sends exactly the right message
9083664 obviously when the pick is unknown it depends how they perform on the first day i thought she did great

9083676 we have had a good start to the year with strong underlying sales growth and a strong cash generation
9083677 weve had all sorts going bust full service low cost high end long haul and short haul because all buy petrol and all have customers getting poorer
9083678 there have been lots of failures already and there will be more
9083679 zoom is by no means the end it is inevitable there will be more bankruptcies as airlines currently flying on vapour realise its not going to work the reason it doesnt look so bad yet is because a lot still have good hedging in place
9083680 it will all depend on the airlines cash position fuel hedging and the ability to access extra funds but the situation is pretty dire
9083681 b amp b results were little short of appalling but this was expected
9083682 in the light of the turbulence in the banking and housing sectors the first six months of this year have been very challenging for b amp b
9083683 in the light of continuing weakness in the housing market and the wider economy we continue to expect arrears and repossessions to increase for the remainder of the year although we will be putting further resources into tackling the problem
9083684 looking forward guidance is for margins to continue falling and arrears to continue rising earnings outlook is therefore very weak management have few levers to pull we fear
9083685 we provisionally expect b amp b to report a loss for 2008 as the loan book shrinks and credit quality deteriorates there is a risk the group remains unprofitable into 2009
9083686 will review our plans to enable us to continue to operate effectively
9083687 what made me a dork in the 80s is cool now
9083688 et godt fungerende billettsystem er viktig for sikre inntekter ikke minst i forhold til en effektiv trafikkavvikling

9083690 given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the uk tax treatment of international groups whose holding company is uk tax resident

9083692 well located properties are still attracting competitive bids which may explain why mayfair which contains a number of trophy properties is outperforming other neighbourhoods such as chelsea
9083693 ordningene b r v re utformet slik at stortingsrepresentanter i st rst mulig grad blir behandlet likt med andre borgere

9083695 were sitting here waiting for about 400 to 500 kids to show up
9083696 we even put up billboards to let them know when school started
9083697 that while the district understands family vacations are important during the school year being away from school is going to have a negative effect on their childrens achievement
9083698 we will have been in school three and a half weeks before the day after labor day
9083699 it cant be that all these people are just moving in at that time and dont know when school starts
9083700 some people who are returning students every year who go on vacation and just dont come back until after labor day
9083701 anyone who benefits when an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
9083702 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9083703 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
9083704 i had just pulled the last page of cop hater out of the typewriter
9083705 from the river bounding the city on the north you saw only the magnificent skyline you stared up at it in something like awe and sometimes you caught your breath because the view was one of majestic splendor the clear silhouettes of the buildings slashed at the sky devouring the blue flat planes and long planes rough rectangles and needle sharp spires minarets and peaks pattern upon pattern laid in geometric unity against the wash of blue and white which was the sky
9083706 a woman gets under your skin some women are like that listen ive been around ive been around plenty i had me more dames than you could count but this one different different right from the beginning she just got under my skin right under it when it gets you like that you cant eat you cant sleep nothing you just think about her all day long and what can you do when you realize you cant really have her unless well unless you hell is it my fault he was a stubborn son of a bitch well hes still stubborn only now hes dead

9083715 i am urging the workers and contractors with the support of the airlines to come to a fair agreement that ensures quality services and keeps passengers moving safely and efficiently
9083716 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9083717 most lawyers do not have the technological experience or the accounting expertise to do almost any of the stuff that these guys do
9083718 theyve got experience they know their way around the courthouse and understand how evidence is used and presented in court theres always a value in talking to these guys
9083719 you have to go out and hit the bushes you have to kick the tires you cant do it sitting behind the desktop and a lot of law firms have tried that
9083720 we look for deep throats someone who knows about what happened
9083721 a lot of law firms tried to do their own investigations in house but in the last three or four years were seeing law firms come to firms like ours for litigation support
9083722 part of our value to our client is being able to work with and solve really big problems without anyone knowing about it
9083723 we cant go out like law firms that splash their verdicts across the front pages of newspapers we just cant do that
9083724 the law firms dont have the forensic labs that we have
9083725 they dont have the private investigator experience that we have we look for that smoking gun e mail or document
9083726 its very easy to get on the bandwagon and get carried away in a sexy investigation
9083727 but employers need to be very cautious about doing this this kind of thing can blow up in the press and it can backfire and turn into a public relations debacle for the organization
9083728 its a big business and they charge good hourly rates to keep track of employees to make sure the company assets are not finding their way to competitors
9083729 im told that it came about following ongoing surveillance of the particular house where the drugs were found its a major coup for the garda
9083730 if you pay for your flight with a credit card or book it as part of a package holiday then you shouldnt have any problems getting your money back
9083731 you may even be covered by your travel insurance as some policies cover scheduled flights sadly if these dont apply to you theres little hope of you seeing your money again so bear this in mind when you book your next flight or renew your travel policy
9083732 there would also be a significant opportunity going forward for the development of clinical leadership posts in nursing and in the therapy areas
9083733 of significantly empowering clinicians as the key designers and leaders of modern health services
9083734 we know from experience that when care services have significant leadership from clinicians they deliver far better results
9083735 to justify comprehensive support by a business manager thereby empowering them to drive change
9083736 i knew i could win the first three stages and i think that in other years i could maybe go for the general classification here and all five stages i think but i lost a lot of form by going to the olympics
9083737 i dont think i am going to go for the overall here i think my job is done now i will defend the yellow jersey as best as possible but we have other options as well in case we need it
9083738 i felt really really strong today but because i had already crashed i was very cautious on the last corner before the finish
9083739 we came around it and i let rip really early and passed a load of guys but then it was too late to move up even more
9083740 i was amongst a group of people who had to line up for ages to get in
9083741 we just waited and passed the time talking about the line up i think it feels like a really joyful festival
9083742 it is really really well organised they have thought of everything there is a sense of security and safety
9083743 i never thought id see the day when id be taking children to a music festival but id definitely recommend it
9083744 they had to dig very very deep personally over the winter against a lot of odds
9083745 that had some kind of a profound effect on them they stuck together when the authorities and the establishment tried to divide and conquer
9083746 i do think it goes back to what they have been through with the all ireland last year that was a very humiliating experience for them and they appreciate the opportunities they are getting now they didnt play well last sunday and i dont think they can play as badly again they had 44 per cent of possession for the whole game and kerry were dominant i feel it will be much closer the next day cork will take more positives than kerry will
9083747 its a good job they didnt bring their full team
9083748 but we played our best football in the munster final
9083749 when i played with kerry we only met cork once a year but familiarity seems to breed contempt now
9083750 there was a meanness of spirit in that game i didnt like this is not typical of kerry or cork teams i think it is because they meet so often now probably three times a year and also it is because cork have been on the receiving end of embarrassing defeats so many times this is hard to take and i am not saying cork are at fault it takes two to tango but they are meeting often and the stakes are so high
9083751 each year it is said to be a defining match
9083752 at this stage kerry have proven they are the team of the decade
9083753 i think they will come at the game positively from the word go the next day if kerry go ahead this time there is no way they will take their foot off the pedal so i think cork will go for it everything their whole pride their existence everything they stood for the whole year and last year is at stake here they will come out guns blazing

9083755 what most people dont seem to realize is that there is just as much money to be made out of the wreckage of a civilization as from the upbuilding of one
9083756 during the month of august they hitmen killed eight us citizens and injured five more on this side of the border
9083757 although mexican citizens are the main victims of these crimes the uncertain security situation also implies a risk for us citizens
9083758 gustav is a category one hurricane on the five level saffir simpson scale strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days and gustav could become a major hurricane near the time it crosses western cuba
9083759 near or over the cayman islands over the western portions of cuba on saturday and into the southern gulf of mexico late saturday or sunday
9083760 these rains will likely produce life threatening flash floods and mud slides
9083761 i am concerned that there are still a number of persons who are still unaccounted for
9083762 it is all wet and i am afraid to sleep inside there
9083763 we dont like you using other peoples towers we are terminating your contract
9083764 sin duda alguna esta constituci n est sintonizada con los procesos de cambio de am rica latina y recoge sobretodo las propuestas nacionales que se fueron acumulando a lo largo de d cadas esta constituci n no surge s lo con el gobierno del presidente correa por el contrario es el resultado de los movimientos sociales de los pueblos ind genas ecuatorianos los hombres y mujeres de las distintas partes del pa s campesinos empresarios estudiantes ecologistas

9083766 she is smart vivacious and energetic she tends to oversimplify complex issues has had difficulty delegating authority and clearly has difficulty distinguishing the line between her public responsibilities and private wishes
9083767 her approval ratings are high 65 percent or so but down from 80 percent earlier in her term most alaskans havent watched her as closely as most reporters or legislators if you took a poll of reporters and legislators i expect her approval rating would be down in the teens or twenties
9083768 it was meant to be oh my god this is the worst thing in the world
9083769 obviously it would have been up to the player to make a decision do i do that or do i say fuck this this is wrong im not doing it
9083770 it was meant to be oh my god this is the worst thing in the world
9083771 obviously it would have been up to the player to make a decision do i do that or do i say fuck this this is wrong im not doing it
9083772 the hundreds of thousands of people who saw denver and colorado and this region over the last 7 days are going to come back as tourists
9083773 we know this is going to pay great dividends in the future conventions are going to look at us and say you can handle anything
9083774 people make money somewhere else they spend it here it creates jobs it pays taxes taxes that we would otherwise have to pay it supports the stadiums rtd all good for denver
9083775 i tried to get some people to come out here with me and nobody wanted to come
9083776 i felt like there was definitely a sense of freedom
9083777 five and three are my lucky numbers so i looked up behind me and seen 535 and sat here in seat 5
9083778 due to the notable model spread late in the forecast period it is once again important to restate that it is simply not yet possible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
9083779 oh heather why are you so depressed all the time
9083780 thank you for the honor of speaking before this gathering and thank you for the work you do in support of the state of israel
9083781 the jewish state has of course experienced tough times before indeed they have perhaps been the norm rather than the exception
9083782 un security council action is required to impose progressively tougher political and economic sanctions
9083783 the recent talks between the israeli government and the government led by president mahmoud abbas in the west bank are encouraging and the should support this effort
9083784 because a precipitous american withdrawal risks all out civil war and the emergence of a failed state in the heart of the middle east inviting intervention from s neighbors and the potential for region wide conflict we must do all in our power to prevail

9084045 she had no management skills but she quieted things down
9084046 now he has all these bills and he doesnt know whos going to pay them
9084047 blow it up from the inside and blame it on the staff
9084048 pulling this va apart as quickly as possible but they are simply following orders and being paid well to do so
9084049 who can i call where am i supposed to go
9084050 theyll have traumatic brain injuries and serious psychiatric issues weve got to stop the shutting down of that particular area right now
9084051 you close that mental health unit you have a bunch of people with psychiatric problems that are pissed off

9084056 but were not going to put this off for a long time this is not a situation were taking lightly
9084057 very concerned about the level of anxiety among veterans and the employees who serve them
9084058 this va has a core unlike any other va ive ever seen the community is incredibly supportive of the mission its tied to the historical legacy and the care thats been provided and in a large part they are responsible for preventing it from being shut down the first time

9084062 touch a this and touch a that dont them a ever touch your pepper plant
9084063 its a hallmark of motor planning in humans and we were pretty surprised to find something like this happening in flies and so rapidly
9084064 everybody assumed that jump reflex would be the first thing
9084065 wed like to find that place in the brain where sensory information is turned into a motor code
9084066 eventually id like to be able to go to an engineer and say this is how you build a fly
9084067 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
9084068 for years vibrant los gatos has been tops on our location wish list
9084069 it was more fun when you could drink just because there was more of a party atmosphere
9084070 it took all the fun from enjoying your holiday weekend
9084071 weve seen people whove tried to hide it in gatorade bottles or cover up a container of beer
9084072 this is historic it gives every current and former serviceman hope that their decision on the battlefield will never be questioned again
9084073 i want to see the same kind of justice for every marine soldier and sailor who has served or is serving in harms way today
9084074 for those who get it no explanation is necessary for those who dont no explanation will do
9084075 at least i am there and you are stuck here in the office nah nah
9084076 we may be turning the corner and hopefully we can shut the door on this soon
9084077 you never think its going to hit home or its going to hit close to you you hear about it all over the world but did you ever think it would happen to you of course not until that day
9084078 this will reach all the inmates currently incarcerated in jail facilities
9084079 both those cases were made based on inmates having heard other people talking i dont know if it was other inmates talking or what but talking about having committed or being involved or knowing about a homicide

9084081 you can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world but when youre finished youll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird so lets look at the bird and see what its doing thats what counts i learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something

9084083 summing up the first look at anti choice creationist sarah palin
9084084 religion as a litmus test or anybodys personal opinion on evolution or creationism
9084085 todd and sarah are scratching their heads why on earth hasnt this why is this guy still representing the department hes a horrible recruiting tool you know
9084086 it looked like there were only two people that believed i was trying to hit a rod the umpire and the guy that worked for the commissioner i didnt try to hit anybody but they found me with that and theres nothing i can do
9084087 the way im looking at it is although we dont agree with it we dont think he was intentionally throwing at anybody we have to accept it and move on and prepare accordingly what this allows him to do now is to take some time to adequately prepare himself to make his next start which will be a week from tomorrow i think hell be a full go at that particular point in time
9084088 you can pitch with some pain and this one isnt a big thing its just a little bit of pain ive been having a problem with my back but its nothing out of control
9084089 they pay me to pitch when i dont pitch im not going to say i dont get paid but thats not why im here its something where i cant help people now ive got to deal with that
9084090 i was supposed to pitch tomorrow i talked to dave and i think the best thing is to do it now so thats why the suspension is starting today once the six games are done ill be ready to pitch
9084091 i will look for people in the cast of john roberts samuel alito and my friend the late william rehnquist
9084092 mr putin here is my statement be aware that i may get back to you in twelve hours with an entirely different one though i reserve the right to
9084093 john mccain put palin a heartbeat away from the presidency
9084094 mr ahmadinejad id like another try at that response i dont believe my first accurately communicated my feelings
9084095 the fact that she will soon be nominated is one more indicator of this country moving forward
9084096 i have never set foot in the u s senate ive never worked in washington and the notion that somehow im immediately going to start running for higher office just doesnt make sense
9084097 look im a state senator who hasnt even been sworn in yet
9084098 well maybe obama doesnt have all that much experience either
9084099 can you just be honest and admit that they both palin and obama lack experience
9084100 no i wont admit she is inexperienced and yet i am being honest with you
9084101 well have a full injury report for you next friday
9084102 hell be designated as whether he practiced or did not practice at this point i would expect he would practice
9084103 definitely i can compete with these girls i dont think the gaps are as big as i once thought
9084104 i go out on court and i feel i have a chance against them today i definitely feel i had a chance it just didnt come together in the way i would have liked it to
9084105 i think shes probably the best british player that i ever played
9084106 she has a very good potential shes very aggressive and she has a good serve the whole game is pretty good
9084107 i just felt i hit too many errors on routine points routine shots
9084108 but i think overall its been a good week for me shes the olympic gold medallist shes one of the favourites for this tournament
9084109 the more im around these girls the more i play against them the more ill learn and the more experience ill have
9084110 i do feel like i can climb the rankings i feel the next stage for me is to breaking into the top 50 thats the next goal for me
9084111 one of the things thats so fantastic about living in canberra is that its a multicultural community
9084112 a lot of people think that is just the embassy strip but thats not true at all its something like 90 per cent of canberra can trace their roots back to a different country
9084113 weve said that canberra is a welcoming city for say migrants and refugees but you know words are cheap unless you put up
9084114 it said to whom it may concern charles couldnt be at work because his daughter had to have a heart transplant
9084115 by her being on that berlin heart it saved her life
9084116 it bought us more time you can live on a berlin heart over 365 days while we were waiting on a heart
9084117 i tried to not let this overcome me because i knew i had a job to do and i had a season coming up
9084118 im not going to lie it was hard some days i would sit in my room and just think what am i doing here i would feel guilty for being at work and not being at the hospital with my kid i had those days
9084119 as far as camp and football and things like that i told charles if he felt like coming to practice come to practice but take care of his family and go from there
9084120 were just glad that it seems like its going to have a happy ending
9084121 you talk about real men and being a father and husband ive had a chance to see him go through a lot of different things and he just stepped up to the plate
9084122 my wife would get on these blog sites and stuff like that and people were wondering why i wasnt at practice
9084123 someone said i was getting traded for one blog said i hit my wife and one blog said i got arrested for drinking and driving it was a bunch of crazy stuff
9084124 i think probably the toughest thing that i had to battle with and i still battle with it now is that i knew in order for my daughter to live another kid had to die
9084125 the biggest thing that i got out of it is youre taking something negative and making it into a positive instead of having just two negatives
9084126 eu posso assegurar que n o houve nenhuma irregularidade ou aloca o pr via
9084127 both darin erstad and brian moehler are excellent veteran leaders who have performed very well for our ballclub this season
9084128 we are excited to have both of them back for the 2009 season as they have played a significant role in our teams improvement in 2008 and will be strong contributors to our future success
9084129 we are very excited to acquire the rights of andrej meszaros
9084130 andrej is a perfect fit within our plan to rebuild the lightning into a contender he has a strong all around game he competes he moves the puck and he can handle big strong forwards defensively
9084131 perhaps more importantly were pleased to add a 22 year old player with almost 250 nhl games already under his belt we know andrej will continue to grow and improve as he matures with the rest of our defense
9084132 one thing we didnt anticipate is that conversations would be a driver in the growth of our product
9084133 but it makes sense one of the things you want to do when you discover something interesting is that you want to talk about it
9084134 we would be very interested in trying to attract the commonwealth to co invest in light rail within the act
9084135 we think it is significant this is the national capital its a significant issue and in response now the commonwealth has asked us for a full business case
9084136 its been about what is best for morris iemma and michael costa in their battle with the war in the labor party
9084137 its about them trying to control their own mps and that means the state is coming a poor second
9084138 it was really good im very proud of that lap
9084139 we went out kind of at the peak of the heat when things were just starting to break all in all im just extremely pleased with the lap and progress we made throughout the day to make the car faster were happy to start up front and hopefully we can take advantage of that
9084140 i think he did a great job putting down a good smooth lap and certainly had us scared throughout the afternoon
9084141 we struggled a little bit today we just couldnt get the speed out of the car and we were a little frustrated with practice because obviously having pepsi on board for the pepsi 500 is a big deal but to be third im ecstatic
9084142 it really stuck well in turns 3 and 4 it was a little tight in 1 and 2 but thats how i like it
9084143 it wasnt the fastest car either time weve been on the track today but weve been close we will find out tomorrow how good our car is in race trim
9084144 i like it because i think that any match is up for grabs i think theres a lot of depth
9084145 i think its kind of exciting that a player ranked 180 in the world can beat the number one thats exciting
9084146 i preferred it when there was steffi graf and the tennis she was playing was really nice to watch
9084147 i havent paid that much attention to the women since steffi there are too many viches
9084148 there are so many russians eastern europeans they have very long names and are very tall
9084149 i like that there are several women at the top who can interchange even monthly i didnt like federer being number one for five years i like a decent mix of challengers
9084150 it used to be a little bit boring now you get a lot more speed different shots and fashion wise its very big now
9084151 its much better than it was 10 years ago its more exciting to watch i like that they hit the ball harder than they used to in the moon ball era
9084152 i like it because i think that any match is up for grabs i think theres a lot of depth
9084153 i think its kind of exciting that a player ranked 180 in the world can beat the number one thats exciting
9084154 i preferred it when there was steffi graf and the tennis she was playing was really nice to watch
9084155 i havent paid that much attention to the women since steffi there are too many viches
9084156 there are so many russians eastern europeans they have very long names and are very tall
9084157 i like that there are several women at the top who can interchange even monthly i didnt like federer being number one for five years i like a decent mix of challengers
9084158 it used to be a little bit boring now you get a lot more speed different shots and fashion wise its very big now
9084159 its much better than it was 10 years ago its more exciting to watch i like that they hit the ball harder than they used to in the moon ball era
9084160 weve had some big wins here over the years but i think that was one of the biggest
9084161 it was a new coaching staff coming in and it was pretty good test to go back there to their place i think they were ranked no 15 in the nation something like that i felt like when we left the field that day there was a different confidence a different belief that our guys had
9084162 these are the reasons you come to michigan state to play in these type of games
9084163 to go across the country and play in a game like this to have all the alumni people from the west coast and all the people coming from here on a labor day weekend come and watch you play
9084164 to be honest i didnt even know that much about cal football in 2002
9084165 what we did then wont help against michigan state this time they like to bring pressure and hit the quarterback so hes always thinking about it weve got to be smart with the ball and not play like its our first game together weve been together in practice long enough to be better than that
9084166 they come off the ball pretty fast and theyre not afraid to hit you
9084167 its going to be fun no matter what though its fun to hit a different color starting off the season with such a good team is going to be fun
9084168 el ego sta es una persona de gustos ruines m s interesada en s misma que en m
9084169 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9084170 she served so many aces i had many chances especially in the first set but somehow i overdid it
9084171 and in the second set when it got tough he dug out some shots and everything seemed to go against me on those break points
9084172 i was never really in danger so it was actually pretty good for me
9084173 i knew the longer the match would go the more tired he would get so it was a good match for me
9084174 after everything ive got through already these are the early round matches so it will only get better from here
9084175 yeah so im really happy to be playing well everybodys cheering me on so its a nice feeling
9084176 i guess were talking about it today and if i win the title you forget about it again thats usually how it goes
9084177 hes been using that mower as a mode of transportation
9084178 its a small town our deputies know dave they know who doesnt have a license
9084179 its not real common but theres been a number of these cases i think it happens all over the state atvs are fairly common guys use them to go to liquor establishments
9084180 they dont have driving privileges to operate a motor vehicle
9084181 about the only thing youd be safe in these days that has a motor is a segway
9084182 we consider ourselves a free agent and feel whichever group we join if any will be in a very good position to win
9084183 were all just going to ride around out there for the first 30 laps
9084184 it would be a lot more exciting for the fans and a lot more fun for us if we only did 10 laps at the end
9084185 the tires go away pretty fast at daytona but they still would have a lot of grip for just 10 or 15 laps
9084186 it feels great to have signed for fulham football club these are exciting times at the club and ive joined to become an integral part of fulhams future success
9084187 the club has made some terrific signings over the summer adding to an already talented pool of players last saturdays win over arsenal shows just how competitive fulham are in the
9084188 im looking forward to meeting up with my new team mates over the next few days settling down and preparing for the clubs next home game against
9084189 this is a crucial stage in my career and im delighted to have committed myself to fulham for what i hope will be my prime years as a professional footballer
9084190 i feel like that we have a great shot at winning this weekend
9084191 its because of our team and our cars and the people preparing them im looking forward to our shot the next couple weeks and making the chase
9084192 were a lot better than where we were last year
9084193 i think that we are still a good enough team to be sixth or seventh in points if we get the right breaks well end up in the chase
9084194 if we dont make the chase were going to run 13th in points its going to be disappointing
9084195 its not very good to look at that way but thats the way it is
9084196 its disappointing but its the way our teams have been its the way gillett evernham has been its the way our drivers have been
9084197 weve come a long ways since last year and were working to get past that to start making more chases than we miss it takes time
9084198 if they race well and we race well were not going to make the chase
9084199 if they have some races where they are a little slower and were good then well probably make the chase its going to be interesting
9084200 this is an important weekend we have to try and be on our game here we need to get out of here with a good finish and i think we can do it
9084201 it sure would be nice to gain a little bit of leeway coming out of california heading to richmond were just looking forward to monday morning and see what we have got
9084202 were certainly not happy with where we are at im not
9084203 but you have to make the best of it we have to pull together here and make this happen this chase is what it is all about you cant win a championship without being in this thing
9084204 if you put a lot more focus and effort and try to really think about this race too much youll probably go out and make a mistake if youre driving on pins and needles the whole 500 laps or 500 miles
9084205 the biggest thing is just to go out and do what youve been doing
9084206 for the most part you just have to race and everything is going to happen for a reason
9084207 if we dont make the chase its not going to be because of these last two races
9084208 it just depends on how intense that meeting was with nascar
9084209 im sure there are probations that are kind of like a slap on the hand and then there are probations where they might have you by the shirt saying you do this again youre really in trouble thats really where the question lies
9084210 im not really sure what type of probation theyre on i know its one word but it might be many levels to it
9084211 ive been on probation before and it didnt change anything for me
9084212 i think what it means is you cant go and just crash somebody
9084213 i did what i felt was best at the time
9084214 in the grand scheme of things i dont think there was really anything that was that bad about last week i thought it was just real good hard racing and what happened afterward is stuff that happens at every short track all around the country every week
9084215 we understand that whatever reaction we make has ramifications to it
9084216 allans done the most to earn this right to start and thats where hes going to be
9084217 you know it was great for us because last year during fall camp there was a point in time where we really felt allan was going to be the guy over t d
9084218 its always nice to look behind you and see a slew of backs
9084219 you look to the left and you see travis beckum and garrett graham there are tremendous athletes everywhere we just have to continue to work and become one cohesive unit
9084220 wisconsin is not going to spread the field and try a quarterback run
9084221 they use his mobility to escape and run play action they have good skill and speed at receiver they are going to run the ball take their shots and feel their way through the first game
9084222 they have got a big line several tight ends and running backs that are about the size of guards for most teams
9084223 they are talented indeed and their running back situation is pretty secure they have a 230 pound tailback a 250 pound fullback and some good tight ends one of whom is extremely good at receiving
9084224 its a great feeling to pound it out and take out your aggressions on a guy and blow them out
9084225 last year we came in thinking that things were going to be given to us last year because of the high expectations this year people have a chip on their shoulder they know weve got to work for it
9084226 the missed opportunities weve seen and the potential too i think thats the biggest thing weve seen what we couldve done and how easily we could have been a great defense it came down to a play here and there getting off the field making this tackle or that tackle
9084227 we made too many mistakes which cost us games we just shot ourselves in the foot take penn state we just got our butts kicked but in the other games we left things on the field our biggest fear was we were going to beat ourselves and i think we did
9084228 were eager to play our first game on the first day of camp we wanted more than our helmets we wanted to go after it right away
9084229 their projects are ready to go and our projects are still on the drawing board
9084230 we have not been aggressive enough in the east metro area
9084231 theres a regional system thats going to develop here very quickly
9084232 we just have to make sure we dont let political considerations trump long term planning
9084233 id argue that no project is more important to washington county than to have that central corridor completed
9084234 the cheats are dull due to the fact that she was gone on vacation and they were programmed while she was away
9084235 we will no longer have a civilian intelligence arm yes we will have analysts but we wont have any real civilian intelligence capability
9084236 he is prejudiced against the cia the day after the 2004 election when bush won mccain came on tv and gave an interview in which he said something to the effect of the cia tried to sabotage this election theyve made their bed and now they have to lay in it i used to like mccain but he is inconsistent
9084237 with cia leaks intended to harm the re election campaign of the president of the united states it is not only dysfunctional but a rogue organization
9084238 who all had these long standing grudges against people in the agency
9084239 they think the cia is a hotbed of liberals right wing nutty paranoia stuff they all love the military and hate the cia because the cia tells them stuff they dont want to hear
9084240 an effective intelligence professional element that will take risks and will be responsive to civilian control and made up of the best and brightest officers the us has to offer
9084241 it has to have a civilian function but will have a vast military element as well i always say you have to keep the central in the central intelligence agency
9084242 lots of people talk to john on foreign policy matters not just randy scheunemann
9084243 there has been a battle within the mccain campaign between neoconservatives and realists but by and large neoconservatives hold the high ground
9084244 ive been in meetings with mccain where some adviser is discussing a policy issue
9084245 and at the end mccain thanks them and says hes made up his own mind and the outcome is the other way
9084246 but this is the guy who sat around talking to all of us when porter came in as cia director in 2004 and told us how much porter respected us and not to worry about the stories we hear he was trying to reassure us that goss was not out to destroy the agency he told us everything is going to be fine
9084247 we certainly have seen a fast growing interest since they are easy to use and economical and therefore they do not stay long in stores
9084248 when the price of gas hit 4 a gallon the spike in interest surged
9084249 its just one extra added service for people who do have the money and do want to make that jump
9084250 i was often pretty sweaty to do it at that speed
9084251 and occasionally had damage to my clothes because of the chain
9084252 there are violations that both nicole and madeleine are worried about
9084253 they are matters that i dont believe would rise to the level they would prosecute under the current standards of the u s attorneys office but in this circumstance perhaps theyll ignore their own standards to prosecute madeleine or her daughter to get what they want
9084254 okay our guys getting clobbered we need a hail mary pass right now or were going to lose this thing
9084255 see see i totally told you i was random and crazy you just never know what im going to do next
9084256 i was very timid about setting up an online profile but with saras help my profile was clever and totally me
9084257 this first one most people look at it kind of as a lose lose situation for us however we know its another game northern iowa is just as capable as any of the other teams in our conference or any other opponents we play this year
9084258 a lot of people who have mentioned playing a i aa team or whatever but theyre a great team
9084259 they come to win so i dont view their division or anything as a weakness theyre a good team
9084260 we dont need a lot of people to believe we can win quite frankly
9084261 we just need the people who are on the field to believe we can win
9084262 how far along they are and how far along we are im not sure either team knows right now well find out soon enough
9084263 theyre fighting the same battles and having the same questions im sure that we have about them
9084264 van halens gonna be pissed off about mccain using their song
9084265 is a crazed genius using our planet as his own personal laboratory
9084266 we want awesome people to work with who will be contributing members of our team of rockstars
9084267 our state of the art office premises include a quality toilet seat
9084268 is capable of setting up an ssl certificate on apache
9084269 weird but it works at least for one of us sterns who loved the crunch of the bacon combined with the intense maple frosting atop this fine pastry the other stern thought it somewhat frankensteinian
9084270 the days selection is displayed on the revolvng shelves of a glass case note the large selection of vegan donuts vegan fare is a not uncommon option in portlands multitude of counter culture eateries
9084271 there is an immensely satisfying crunch to the crust of these old fashioned donuts glazed to the left chocolate frosted to the right
9084272 were not sure what the space occupied by voodoo donuts used to be but its raw industrial nature has not been monkeyed with and it adds a brawny charm to this destination donut shop
9084273 a sign like this is guaranteed to perk the interest of an adventurous roadfooder
9084274 just before dinner the dining room at catfish hill is calm and quite once the catfish starts coming it is a joyous place
9084275 there goes our experience argument against obama out the window
9084276 this reinforces that sen mccain wants to be the independent reformer change ticket hes not ceding that to sen obama
9084277 originally when they contacted me they said we are doing this shoot for obama 08 and you are going to be in your underwear
9084278 totally unlike thin sliced bologna you get in the supermarket case pella bologna has a rich smoky flavor and is customarily sliced into bite size discs it is always made in a ring shape which makes for easy carrying
9084279 int veld is where locals shop for meat and visitors to the town square can sample unique pella specialties
9084280 working on this project has been like a dream come true for me
9084281 when i was younger it was books like spawn that made me want to draw comic books for a living so to actually have the ability to fulfill that dream on spawn really cant be beat
9084282 its fun is to see if your characters can fit into different settings genres mediums and or formats as a means to get your idea in front of more new eyes the adventures of spawn is such an attempt unlike the regular title this one is truly built around the word adventure join us as we dive head first into a world of spawn unlike the others ive populated
9084283 they the bengals stuck with the plan to rest him

9084287 i have collected a lot of jhonen vasquez jthm squee roman dirge lenore and pete bagge hate comics adam dueer is a longtime spawn fan and collects mcfarlane figures and has been a member of the online forum for several years
9084288 my favorite is probably crossing midnight i plan to read more of that when i get home the spawn armageddon seemed to be the most popular spawn series the collections were best since you get the entire story reading is a great escape from stress and boredom and lots of the guys enjoy comics ill read anything that i can get my hands on and really enjoyed most of the books
9084289 just living a normal life waking up with my wife going grocery shopping doing absolutely nothing if thats what i feel like doing
9084290 my brother charles sent me a comic book signed by todd as part of his christmas present
9084291 being 7 500 miles from home and spending christmas without family and friends the last thing i expected to receive was a personal drawing from todd mcfarlane bottom line is that he didnt have to do anything but he did and he did it for a soldier
9084292 regardless of whether we ask for this war a soldier is ready to fight and die for his country and when a citizen takes a moment to shake their hand or show their appreciation it means a lot and has a positive effect on their morale plus he created spawn and spawn kicks ass
9084293 although these coins are common i believe that the sergeants oif coin is one to be cherished
9084294 sergeants in the u s army are one of the only ranks that are directly involved in the daily routine and leadership of their soldiers the lives of every soldier are dependant on the sergeants ability to train and lead his soldiers in battle also this coin represents the oif v which will be known as the year that u s forces were able to eradicate the insurgency and allow the seeds of democracy to grow
9084295 our company tries to help the troops as much as possible given what they do for our country every day

9084303 la violencia responde a la intolerancia y por la decisi n del pueblo que a trav s del voto mayoritario y aplastante ha decidido continuar con el proceso de cambio el fascismo no telera eso y no tolera la expresi n del 10 de agosto

9084305 estos materiales no pueden ser siquiera utilizados bajo el argumento de material antimotines

9084311 i went to the doctor and i chipped some piece of a bone off in my hand kind of like what i did at daytona just a little bit bigger piece
9084312 its just another hit to the season they just keep coming each weekend i guess the biggest downer was we were having a pretty good weekend the 600 was going good he was fourth fastest in friday practice the superbike i think i was fourth or fifth at the time its just a bummer but thats the way it goes some time now weve just got to figure out what were gonna do for tomorrow and see what happens
9084313 in fact this race is all weve been talking about for the past few weeks it is the first time that all our friends and family will be on hand to see us run and that makes it extremely special there is nothing quite like having your own cheering section it gives you that extra push to really want to shine the track held a promoter day last week and we came out and rode the course on our suzuki sv650 it is a fun track and the racing should be good
9084314 it takes some getting used to and is both technical and physically demanding i like the challenge of learning new tracks and thats part of what makes this series fun
9084315 we ran the first 8 hours at daytona and loved it
9084316 from the first race we were completely hooked we ran last year with team ducati new york in the bmw grandsport twins class and ended the season in fifth this year we have our own st team our background is pretty much sprint racing and this is a completely different ball game it is a total blast and not only is it a great series but all the people from the officials to the racers are awesome and the atmosphere is really neat
9084317 as eric said it is very different from sprint racing in sprints you just put your head down and go for it this type of team racing requires a whole different approach you have to pay attention to details and strategy is all important in addition it is much more physically demanding we are having a good time with it
9084318 he is my business partners son and is just 20 years old his energy and enthusiasm is a big up for all of us he is lots of fun to have around in short we are all pretty much a big family and this series really hits the bill for us
9084319 there was still some water on the track from rain earlier in the day but the bike was pretty good i wish they gave points for practice because i could use a few
9084320 things felt pretty good considering the track was still damp and i havent been here since last year
9084321 i didnt get as many laps as i wanted because it was spitting at the end were trying to treat it like a normal race weekend but we are being extra cautious
9084322 in the motions supporting memorandum berg charges that the dnc failed to verify obamas eligibility to run for president
9084323 a wnd investigation could not find any proof obama used an indonesian passport to travel to pakistan however wnd noted that pakistan in 1981 was under military rule and that it was difficult for u s citizens to travel to the country without assistance meaning it would have been easier to enter pakistan on an indonesian passport
9084324 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
9084325 well that is our job we dont technically get money for
9084326 we dont have the resources or time to add a fourth race to the launch of starcraft ii but im sure in the event that we decide to do an expansion set its a feature thatll come up for discussion
9084327 we talked about the possibility of a fourth race early on but we felt like we had a finite amount of great ideas and wanted to make sure we focused all the cool best ideas on the existing three races rather than diluting those ideas across four races

9084331 fanmail why doesnt obama show the black side of his family
9084332 i think this is the biggest political gamble just about in all of american history
9084333 in picking an unknown untested half a term woman governor from alaska to be his running mate john mccain is following in a long line of reckless men who have rolled the dice for a beauty queen except in this case mccain is taking one of the biggest boldest gambles in modern american political history
9084334 obamas lack of readiness was the only way to win
9084335 how in the name of god can she even think about leaving her child or taking her child on the campaign trail for 70 days
9084336 no way that those two people mccain palin should be in charge of her kids future
9084337 im not going to pretend i know how all this came to be
9084338 know what the plan is to ever end the war
9084339 palin asked her outright if she could live with censorship of library books
9084340 bsg obviously has set an incredibly high standard but im pretty confident that working with someone as talented and bright as joss whedon i should be in good hands for awhile i think one of the most important thing ill take from the bsg experience is working with that caliber of actor writer and producer ive set my own work ethic at a comparable level and will always try to reach it
9084341 i would direct anything if its got a good story to it i think bsg proved beyond a doubt that you can make an intelligent drama regardless of whether its in the sci fi genre or not my first love is drama so hopefully that would be my first project i think id also enjoy directing an intelligent thriller at some point like i said im game as long as i believe in the story
9084342 i tend to do small variations then again it really depends on a few factors what im getting from the other actor and what direction im being given i definitely come in with some strong choices yet we need to put the scene on its feet before you really get a feel for it if the opportunitys there i like to give subtle yet important takes on a scene for the director to use
9084343 i guess youre trying to get that baby to come early

9084370 it only stands to reason that where theres sacrifice theres someone collecting the sacrificial offerings where theres service there is someone being served the man who speaks to you of sacrifice is speaking of slaves and masters and intends to be the master
9084371 rands had a point about the real motives of those who call for sacrifice but i dont think she would object to honouring those who put their lives at risk to keep us safe

9084401 the fallout from the delays in posting hillsborough primary election results continued wednesday with the voting machine manufacturer calling a news conference to accept responsibility for the glitch and to offer assurances that the 6 million system will work correctly in novembers general election
9084402 hillsborough elections supervisor buddy johnson did something incredible tuesday even for buddy johnson he took longer to report the results of the primary election than even those counties where the voter turnout was three or four times as strong of course listening to him the mess was no big deal and somebody elses fault it always is what will his chaotic leadership bring come november

9084404 if the machine recount results in a difference between one fourth of one percent and one half of one percent the results are final but if the difference is one fourth percent or less local elections officials must physically examine each of the ballots that have been marked with undervotes in which machines may not have registered a voters intended vote and overvotes in which voters may have marked more than one option

9084408 recently approved pesticides have been implicated in massive bee die offs and are the focus of increasing scientific scrutiny
9084409 epa should be evaluating the risks to bees before approving new pesticides but now refuses to tell the public what it knows pesticide restrictions might be at the heart of the solution to this growing crisis so why hide the information they should be using to make those decisions
9084410 epa needs to help shed some light so that researchers can get to work on this problem
9084411 the public has no idea whether those studies have been submitted to the epa or not and if so what they show maybe they never came in maybe they came in and they show a real problem for bees maybe theyre poorly conducted studies that dont satisfy epas requirement
9084412 weve been monitoring the bee die off situation for a couple of years and its a complex puzzle that may also involve mites viruses and other factors
9084413 we want this information now we cannot continue to wait bees are disappearing our whole existence depends on them because we eat the flowers need to be pollinated and the only ones to do it are the bees
9084414 honeybee health and sustainable pollination is a major issue facing american agriculture that is threatening our food supply and endangering our natural environment
9084415 haagen dazs ice cream is made from the finest all natural ingredients and the plight of the honeybee could mean many of the ingredients used in our top flavors like vanilla swiss almond and strawberry would be difficult to source
9084416 we use 100 percent all natural ingredients like strawberries raspberries and almonds which we get from california the bee problem could badly hurt supply
9084417 one third of our nations food supply depends on bee pollination but bees are vanishing in massive numbers this gift will help us to rebuild and revitalize our honeybee program

9084421 if i were asked by the newly elected president i would strongly encourage him to be extremely vigilant during the transition period and within the first six months of his administration against an attack by al qaeda on american interests at home or abroad
9084422 i could see al qaeda waiting to determine who was going to be the president and depending on which it is taking an initial measure
9084423 for instance obama may be viewed as someone who will accomplish what al qaeda would like him to do which is get out of the middle east and give him an opportunity to move in that direction failing that they may decide to test him with a substantial attack on america or some american interest and see how he reacts
9084424 i think people are only now beginning to realize that barack is not your run of the mill ordinary illinois politician
9084425 i feel bad about giving barack advice because every time i do i know that hes thought about it already so i would draw him aside and say the minute youre inaugurated you will be tested hell say oh you mean like kennedy was with the bay of pigs hell show me some way that hes thought about that some time ago the guy is absolutely scary smart the real mistake al qaeda can make is the one everybody else makes of underestimating the man
9084426 they are in a wait and see situation right now
9084427 they run the risk if they attack before the election of really influencing the way the election goes to their detriment if theres an attack i really believe mccain is going to run away with the election and i dont think they want that i think they really would like obama as their first choice and clinton as their second
9084428 al qaeda has a pattern of testing new american leaders
9084429 even now al qaeda is probably trying to plan something for after the u s inauguration
9084430 i think to a certain extent al qaeda tested president clintons administration several times the response was ineffective i think al qaeda concluded it could attempt something as ambitious as 9 11 but concluded the time was better after a new president who would not have time to review his strategy on al qaeda the time settled on was the summer or early fall after a new president was inaugurated they chose september because they wanted all the officials to be back at their desks from summer vacations
9084431 whether an incident of national security significance occurs just before or soon after the presidential transition the actions or inactions of the outgoing administration may have a long lasting effect on the new presidents ability to effectively safeguard u s interests and may affect the legacy of the outgoing president
9084432 i think they are still somewhat fractured if you want to look at it as a piece of window glass its broken but there are lots of sharp pieces out there i think within the tribal areas of pakistan they feel pretty darn comfortable
9084433 i think its wistful to think that it wont happen by 20 years
9084434 the scenarios we discuss today are very hard for us to contemplate and so emotionally traumatic and unsettling that it is tempting to push them aside
9084435 however now is the time to have this difficult conversation to ask the tough questions and then to get answers as best we can and take preparatory and preventive action
9084436 for while the probability of a nuclear weapon one day going off in a u s city cannot be calculated it is almost surely larger than it was five years ago
9084437 it is also expected that due to lack of information getting to the public many people will try to flee by car or on foot often in the wrong direction again exposing themselves to high levels of radiation as vehicles provide virtually no protection

9084480 in three days 9 people died and 17 were injured in traffic accidents in phnom penh
9084481 phnom penh on 27 august 2008 from morning to night many citizens including husbands wives and children 18 years and older went to the headquarters of a company the writer of this article focused on this company surprisingly does not name the company or give any related information that has received a legal permit to develop the boeng kak region so some residents start to go and give their thumbprints to leave the boeng kak region getting compensation money or new housing
9084482 as for citizens who agree to take the compensation money or new housing the company will continue to offer this until no more family is left outside of this scheme
9084483 at the company headquarters the citizens who went to accept the compensation money or new housing in order to leave the old region said that they took the money because they want to run their businesses and live in the new places with a good environment and they do not want to live above the sewage at the lake which affects their heath
9084484 the new housing that they agree to receive can be constructed one floor above the ground and it is in cham chao dangkoa
9084485 while this exchange process is going on citizens accept money or housing while the company gets the thumbprints in exchange showing that the citizens agree the leave the region it is seen that the company had prepared documents very carefully including fair lucky draws and thumbprints are taken from husbands wives and children who are 18 or older and the company explained clearly the statutes of the contracts in order to avoid any future complicated problems
9084486 in the meantime the company also informed about another good news that the company offers riel 100 million loans approx us 25 000 with a very low interest rate to help the citizens from the boeng kak region who agree to live in new locations to run small businesses
9084487 now the citizens living at the boeng kak lake gradually go to give their thumbprints to receive the compensation money and new housing as for the company it is trying to prepare everything for the citizens without delay
9084488 most of the citizens agreed to take us 8 000 and riel 2 million because they want to choose a new location by themselves where it is easy to run their everyday living businesses
9084489 as for the development of the boeng kak region it is seen that the company has started to pump sand into lake gradually since 26 august 2008

9084498 i am extremely disappointed with todays decision by the u s supreme court
9084499 while the decision brings some degree of closure to alaskans suffering from 19 years of litigation and delay the court gutted the jurys decision on punitive damages
9084500 it is tragic that so many alaska fishermen and their families have had their lives put on hold waiting for this decision my heart goes out to those affected especially the families of the thousands of alaskans who passed away while waiting for justice

9084530 as we near a sellout in little rock we wanted to give fans that are not able to attend the game the opportunity to watch bobby petrinos first game in little rock as the razorbacks head coach
9084531 we appreciate the cable systems working with us to provide live television coverage of razorback football throughout the state and in louisiana
9084532 we hollered like grown men we kicked it hopefully therell be a good outcome from this
9084533 youll be hanging swanging drinking two types of patr n i done mixed up silver and gold i done mixed up silver and gold imma tryin to get drunk before this party somebodys gonna have to carry me home i done drank the silver and gold
9084534 silver and gold silver and gold id rather have jesus than silver and gold no fame or fortune nor riches untold id rather have jesus than silver and gold
9084535 the record it got leaked then me and kirk franklin had to talk he was doing most of the talking he was saying it wasnt no disrespect he was saying he knows how songs get leaked he had it happen to him before he said he wasnt a saint and it wasnt like he never did nothing wrong its not like kirk said i did something wrong he said if i was gonna go with it just change the melody you can still say silver and gold hes got a lot of people saying stuff to him how could you let t pain destroy a gospel song like that how could let him talk about alcohol i wasnt even doing it for a mixtape or nothing i was literally drinking and made a song i was bored in the studio there was nothing else to do i made it into an alcoholic anthem which wasnt good
9084536 just like that i gotta go in im talking to little cousins that like yankee and all that and theyre starting to believe that john mccain is the best candidate i cant have that
9084537 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics
9084538 what most of us are expecting is a continuation of the legacy that the work we did in the 70s 80s and 90s was not in vain thats really where the hurt is coming from that the younger generation wouldnt forget about us and the struggles we had to fight for this even to have a rap city we expect those that come after us to keep that torch lit
9084539 the originators of rap rhymed silly nursery rhymes on break beats and lacked any semblance of modern skill levels for the most part thats exactly why they were left behind when things took a quantum leap
9084540 i hate that old ass rappers who cant find another hustle or move on in life position themselves as some fictitious gatekeepers of the
9084541 you are going to like me you are going to want me in every one of your classes
9084542 i love when my singles become songs like that im not really into the whole radio friendly take it to the club cars hoes jewelry rap thats really not me man
9084543 i love when i can make a song thats about something every bar on the song means something to me
9084544 crazy man cause travis barker dont live far from me man he lives around the corner and i got the track dope boys and im like this track is like some drums away from being sick man and i kept listening to it
9084545 he killed it man he listened to the song twice and then he just went in
9084546 ill be in cashville beginning of september with buck rolling out the red carpet in his town man you know well be in phoenix were doing a couple little appearances coming up buck is the homie and imma ride it out with him
9084547 i never really spoke to 50 cent a lot i never talked to tony yayo and only spoke to lloyd banks in passing man
9084548 me and buck been kin and honest since day one so youll look forward to the mixtapes the mixtapes are nothing we gonna do that and we gonna do a lot of other stuff in the near future
9084549 thats what i would do but i dont think 50 will let that happen man hes just a bitter dude man hes a smart guy real dope business mind but you know he does things that make me question his integrity
9084550 oh look theres the birds nest youre almost done ok now youre running under the stadium you can hear the crowd waiting for you now youve made it into the stadium and listen to all those people cheering you on
9084551 this drawing required really patience but i like the result this time vega seems like a movie star but shes actually a queen so its ok i hope you like it
9084552 they catch it and they go and hit it thats the biggest thing
9084553 but were looking forward to helping out the team and doing the best we can
9084554 were both threats and can take it to the house and im happy for that opportunity
9084555 its just kind of a case where a lot of our freshmen have got to play
9084556 weve just got to get out there and play and believe in them and make sure they believe in themselves
9084557 were expecting the same results they had in 2005 when the razorbacks were no 1
9084558 we might have some young guys back there but theyre going to have to step it up it takes everybody on kickoff returns but the biggest thing is the guys back there toting it
9084559 weve spent a lot of time on it and hopefully our work will pay off because thats a part of the game where you can get more yardage chunks than almost any other time
9084560 thats an area weve got to improve on from a punt return and punt coverage standpoint
9084561 if you get a big return or a block a punt thats such a big yardage swing on that one play
9084562 jarius catches the ball well and then he can do some things with it after he catches it
9084563 right now its his job to lose and i dont anticipate him losing it
9084564 you couldnt run with the ball after you caught it and that wasnt really any fun
9084565 being a receiver i wanted to catch it and take off running
9084566 i was young but i was pretty fast faster than a lot of the other kids
9084567 back then i was bigger than a lot of them too so i kind of bullied them
9084568 it makes me feel real good knowing the coaches have that type of confidence in me to put me back there on returns
9084569 it makes me want to come out and do really really well
9084570 the biggest thing is we want to have at least 10 yards a return
9084571 if we dont get 10 yards everybody on that field ought to be dang upset with themselves
9084572 kickoffs and punts are the first play of offense and the first play of defense
9084573 special teams are just as important as any offensive or defensive play
9084574 coach pelphrey invited me down there but i had already sent in my information to florida
9084575 he told me to come back down next summer he was letting me know hes going to recruit me and was going to keep up with me hes real nice i like coach pelphrey a lot justice and four other campers surprised people at the florida camp by defeating the gators starting five by seven points
9084576 my team was up first and we played jai lucas and the starting five for four minutes and we ended up beating them so we got to stay up
9084577 i think they were expecting the college guys to stay up so everyone could play them but we beat them and played against five other campers
9084578 i thought jai lucas would be quicker than elisha but elisha is as quick as he is
9084579 he held his own with him and that showed me right there that elisha can play for anybody he came away confident and feels like he can play with anybody other schools showing interest include colorado western kentucky and marshall
9084580 if they offered it would be tough to turn down
9084581 hes the best defender ive ever seen on the high school level
9084582 i cant stand watching someone dribbling the ball right in front of my face
9084583 next summer hes going to hit the circuit really big
9084584 obviously when your university and conference have the opportunity to be on the national stage every week either on cbs or espn that is the best exposure possible
9084585 teams can sell the exposure they will get more than any other conference and perhaps the nfl the announcement drew mixed reviews from two national recruiting analysts allen wallace and tom lemming
9084586 theyre already recruiting extremely high caliber athletes everybody is on tv all the time now anyway the coaches may mention it to kids but they wont care notre dame use to be able to tell everyone theyre on television all the time and they had their own network and i dont think that works for the irish anymore
9084587 i kind of assumed this was going on anyway because everybody on the west coast thinks the sec is usually favored by espn
9084588 everybody already believes that and youll see a lot of people complain about it
9084589 i think it helps arkansas because schools like georgia florida and alabama are already on nationally a lot of times
9084590 you dont see arkansas nearly as much as you see those schools e mail richard davenport at rdavenport arkansasonline com
9084591 when the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace
9084592 im excited to see how we execute and play on the field without the coaches around petrino said he is nervous but filled with anticipation to be sending a large troop of true freshmen into action against western illinois
9084593 i think it will be new to them when they run through the a
9084594 its hard to simulate because theyve never been in front of 74 000 people before
9084595 you always have a decision to make of where we feel like tyler is whether you try to hold onto that redshirt or whether you say lets play him lets give him experience
9084596 weve really got some work to do on that decision
9084597 fans will not be allowed to exit the stadium and then return for any reason without utilizing a new unused game ticket
9084598 i learned a lot not just about football but how to treat people how to be a teacher
9084599 im very excited about coming back to arkansas for the game
9084600 vince was looking for a young coach and having monte work for me i knew he was ready
9084601 monte was very well organized if you gave him an assignment to do as a g a he was going to take great pride in it and do it to the best of his ability he wasnt afraid to ask questions
9084602 when he did have a chance to sit in with you and watch film you could see he understood things and he was good with the kids henderson not only has been preparing his players for the razorbacks but also for the fans
9084603 they know they wont hear anything else like it anywhere in the country
9084604 trovare qualcuno da amare ed esserne ricambiati una cosa meravigliosa ma trovare lanima gemella veramente il paradiso lanima gemella una persona che ti capisce come nessunaltra che ti ama come nessunaltra che sar l per te
9084605 rimani e pensa a questa notte a quelle cose dette e fatte a tutto il tempo ancora cha avrai davanti
9084606 the club was doing good business if you went there on a weekend you saw it was packed maybe at other times it wasnt as crowded but that is true everywhere the club was doing fine what is going on here is that 40 40s 24 000 square feet is valuable real estate and they came to us with an offer and this was a good business deal
9084607 this was a business decision pure and simple as you have seen from being down there our current sports book offering is less than ideal we want to change that and taking back the 40 40 space is the ideal option additionally we will offer new gaming tables slots in the space which will be a component 40 40 couldnt add as we obviously have a nevada gaming license
9084608 we are so thrilled to have such a large diverse group of alumni in town this weekend
9084609 we have a great schedule of events planned and this will be a tremendous opportunity for our alumni to soak in the razorback atmosphere
9084610 on this level when you play quarterback youre on the field and are pretty much in control of everything thats going on
9084611 we are going to ask him to make the decisions
9084612 in anticipation of possible litigation over the amounts of restitution they may be owed
9084613 we are really excited to get out and play someone
9084614 job one for the christian leader is to be healthy if you havent done that the church doesnt need you to attempt job number two
9084615 when i heard the news my heart skipped two beats
9084616 im so ready to play henry played at west memphis and averaged 28 points 8 rebounds and 6 assists and was rated as one of the top 100 high school prospects in the nation in 2007 he signed with cincinnati but was ineligible and he enrolled at cincinnati harmony community
9084617 the university of arkansas is pleased to partner with razorback sports properties to offer a pay per view broadcast for the arkansas louisiana monroe game
9084618 as we near a sellout in little rock we wanted to give fans that are not able to attend the game the opportunity to watch bobby petrinos first game in little rock as the razorbacks head coach
9084619 we are pleased to be able to offer the broadcast of this game to razorback fans
9084620 its an opportunity for fans that cant make it to war memorial stadium to see the game and the festivities associated with the 60 th anniversary celebration of war memorial stadium
9084621 i think it will be new to them when they run through the a
9084622 its hard to simulate because theyve never been in front of 74 000 people before
9084623 once the kickoff goes and they get their first hit theyll be in good shape
9084624 i felt like we had a good week of preparation and really experiencing for the first time just exactly how the work week goes
9084625 we worked hard tuesday and wednesday we came out and worked hard two good days trying to be physical and understand we are still going to hit as the year goes on
9084626 thursday we just come out and hour and 15 minutes
9084627 a couple of weeks there they didnt feel things were going too well but you watch the video it was one guy here and one guy there i think a lot of it was youth
9084628 i think the defensive coaches did a good job of trimming back what we were asking them to do
9084629 what we want to try to do is understand we get better as the game goes on so that we learn as the games going on
9084630 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9084631 i think my kids are not necessarily bad drivers but rather they make poor decisions sometimes
9084632 this is my first time here so dont f it up state
9084633 the tomato soup is fine but stay away from the clam chowder those clams have been in the back of the freezer for month oh and fred spit in the split pea soup
9084634 music sites that tell you beethoven is the performer that allegro is the name of the piece that the piano soloist might be the berlin philharmonic
9084635 there is hardly a majority of record label bosses who think music should be free even if you think that high cd prices reward labels far too generously for their investment in finding and nurturing artists there is still a case that artists should be paid directly when a consumer takes possession of their music
9084636 consumers are showing that they want their music for free and record labels are finally starting to ask can we make money from free mr arash amel said he uses the analogy of television programmes expensive media content that is free to the consumer paid for via other means such as advertising
9084637 but justin you still havent answered my question whats the problem
9084638 honey honey stop for god sakes not now at least let me pull off the damn freeway a friend told me over the phone that tea leoni is lucky and she would trade places with her in a minute he doesnt have a problem in fact its a blessing

9084641 i do not agree i knew that he felt this way but i do not agree with him he is still a good man we just have differing opinions
9084642 but all those experienced old white guys in office have run this country into the ground so maybe a little inexperience is just what this country needs
9084643 ein sch fer hat 125 schafe und 5 hunde wie alt ist der sch fer

9084645 ni ustedes se imaginan lo que va a haber dentro de treinta a os
9084646 i am really looking forward to reading the book in norwegian
9084647 my wife and i wrote this show because we thought there was a great need for people to understand these issues
9084648 hes made music for many people like marlon brando sophia loren and charlie chaplin
9084649 to have him here is really exciting it is also important for people to understand the message in his show
9084650 everyone knows that peace is important but many people dont know how to find it
9084651 as bahais we believe we have the solution and that is what this show is about bahaullah shows us how to find peace
9084652 i also think it has an important message it shows that if people want they can live together in peace
9084653 i think it is particularly important to offer people such events
9084654 even if you risk having just 10 people who actually take up on this message they will all benefit from it and then they can act as multipliers taking the message to others
9084655 i saw people that i thought would never go to such a concert
9084656 especially the one sentence at the beginning of the show peace or annihilation you have the choice
9084657 i think it was very important for people to take these words home with them
9084658 weve dedicated our lives to trying to build a better world
9084659 im still receiving so many different offers that i have to turn down work
9084660 we are gravely concerned about the fate of these three bahais who are being held without charges in a case that is clearly based on religious persecution
9084661 although the three have lived in yemen for more than 25 years they hold iranian passports and we have come to believe that the yemeni government may be planning to deport them to iran where the government is waging a systematic campaign against bahais
9084662 while calling for their immediate release our primary concern today is to ask that the yemeni government resist any impulse to deport these three bahais to iran or any other country deportation to any country for three individuals with well established businesses and families for their religious beliefs would be grossly unjust but deportation to iran where they face the possibility of torture would be a clear violation of international human rights law
9084663 our hope has been to prevent this case from becoming a major human rights matter over the issue of religious persecution
9084664 under international laws on the freedom of religion there is no question that bahais and others in yemen should be free to practice their faith while the situation is still unfolding we stand by the right of bahais in yemen and elsewhere to practice their religion in all aspects without the fear of being forced to leave their adopted country

9084760 sesungguhnya kami turunkan kitab al quran itu kepada engkau dengan kebenaran oleh sebab itu sembahlah allah dengan tulus ikhlas beragama kerananya semata mata ketahuilah bahawa agama yang suci murni al khalis itu hanya kepunyaan tuhan dan orang orang yang mengambil pelindung pelindung selain dari tuhan itu dengan men gatakan kami tidak menyembahnya melainkan untuk membawa kami lebih dekat kepada tuhan sesungguhnya tuhan itu akan memutuskan perkara di antara mereka mengenai hal yang mereka sengketakan tuhan tidak memberikan pimpinan kepada orang yang pendusta lagi engkar
9084761 dan mereka hanya diperintahkan supaya menyembah tuhan dengan tulus ikhlas beragama untuk tuhan semata mata berdiri lurus menegakkan sembahyang dan membayar zakat dan itulah agama yang betul

9084765 if it were not that you were to think that i am afraid of death i would have lengthened my prayer
9084766 o allah count them one by one kill them one by one and let there not remain a single one from them alive
9084767 as long as i am killed as a muslim for the sake of allah i do not care on what side i fall all this is for the sake of allah if he wishes he will bless me with the reunion of the torn pieces of my body
9084768 i have never in my life seen a prisoner in a better state than khubaib indeed i saw him eat of the grapes and the fruits that were available that day in makkah all this while he was fettered in iron chains it could only have been a provision provided for him by allah
9084769 do men think that they will be left alone by saying we believe and that they will not be tested indeed we surely tested those before them so that allah may know those who were truthful to their covenant and those that lied
9084770 it is obligatory upon the people to ransom the prisoners with all what they possess and there is no difference in this amongst the jurists because the prophet saws said
9084771 if the state was to spend its entire treasury to ransom the muslim captives from the hands of the enemies it would not be deemed as too much
9084772 where are the glorious days of the muslims where are the days of the conquerors and where are you o muslims
9084773 indeed my son has been taken prisoner at the hands of the christians so you have to pay the ransom or bring him back
9084774 i am coming to respond to your plea i am coming to respond to your plea
9084775 o king how is it that you can allow for blood to be spilt the women folk to be taken into slavery and peoples possessions to be taken from them without any justification from god and his messengers is the king not aware that in our lands reside untold numbers of christians living in peace and security our dealings with them are known to all how can it be then that our prisoners are treated in such ways that no morally upright man or person of religion can ever be pleased with rather many of them were taken through treachery and treachery is forbidden in all religions legislations and politics how can you allow holding captive those that were taken through treachery do you think you will be granted safety when you will face the muslims after all what you have done and the treachery that you have displayed allah will aid them and give them victory especially in these times when the ummah has bolstered its ranks and prepared for the fight ahead the righteous and the allies of the most merciful have become observant in obeying his commands the coastal borders are now being manned by stern and strong commanders whose results we have already seen and their ranks are always increasing in addition amongst the ranks of the muslims are men committed their accounts both new and old have reached the ears of the kings amongst them are righteous people whose prayers allah does not refuse nor does he make their demands come to naught they are such people that if they are angered allah gets angry and if they are pleased allah is pleased o king knowing that the muslims border you from many fronts what good can arise from treating these muslim prisoners in a way that no sound minded man whether a muslim or one that has agreed to a peace treaty with the muslims could ever reconcile
9084776 indeed allah most high has elected you to look after the affairs of this ummah that you always observe your duty with justice and follow the dictates of his prophet saws in lowering your wing of humility and being gentle with the people
9084777 and what is the matter with you that you do not strive in the way of allah and for the sake of the oppressed men women and children who call out our lord
9084778 indeed my son has been captured by the franks and i cannot sleep the night because of my longing for him i have a small house that i can sell as a ransom for my son so can you guide me to anyone that would buy it so that i may work at setting my son free with the price that i obtain from the sale for indeed i live my day and night unsettled i cannot find any sleep or patience or rest
9084779 depart now so that i may look into this matter by the permission of allah
9084780 listen to his story may allah have mercy upon you
9084781 i was amongst those who used to serve the king all the time bound in fetters and one day while i was walking the chain broke loose from my feet therefore my guard then came to me and swore at me and said why have you removed the chain from your feet i said no i swear by allah i did not even touch it it just came loose and i didnt even feel it fall so they brought the blacksmith who put the chain back on my feet fixed the link and tightened the screws firmly as soon as i stood up the chain again broke loose so they put it back again this time even more securely and again it fell they then asked their monks about the cause of this their monks asked does he have a mother i replied yes they replied indeed she has prayed for you and her prayers have been answered set him free so they set me free and guarded me until i arrived at the islamic lands
9084782 whoever fears allah allah will find a way out for him from every difficulty and he will provide for him from sources that he could never have imagined
9084783 the climbing and descending on this course are brutal and keeping focused when night falls makes this a race that tests you physically and mentally

9084793 this book is a very helpful one that when i first looked at it i thought a man couldnt write but he did
9084794 finally a book that brings together nearly everything gods word calls a woman to be from within herself to her marriage and family as well as the church and the public square chanskis womanly dominion is biblical womanhood 101 a biblical succinct practical course that shows women how to think gods thoughts after him to align themselves with their holy and awesome calling and to free themselves from the pressures of worldly thinking about womanhood chanski is at times very frank and direct at other times witty and humorous and remarkably open and courageous but he is always biblical and realistic and knows how to open up the fulness of the womans massive calling if women follow the advice contained in this book they will be prayerful joyful content fulfilled and too busy exercising biblical dominion in every sphere of life to join the female murmurers and feminists of the twenty first century
9084795 whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all
9084796 too many christians men and women have bought into secular and even pagan notions of godly womanhood godly womanhood is not simply having the right ideas or even simply the right doctrine we do not need a generation of evangelical stepford wives nor do we need a generation of proverbs 31 ann coulters instead the scripture calls us to christ honoring heroic women with a gentle and quiet spirit that is beautiful in the sight of the lord mark chanski calls us to this vision with grace clarity and conviction this book will help women to grow in christ it will also help older women to mentor younger women and it will help parents to raise daughters of dominion
9084797 womanly dominion is biblical practical and compelling mark chanski provides the church with a presentation of biblical womanhood that has the rare combination of winsomeness and theological clarity if you care about the home and church you need to read this book
9084798 this is a fine book that lifts christian women to their queenly provence which reigns far above the mythical sovereignties of feminism read this book and be liberated we highly recommend it

9084909 nurses dont want to see moms and babies being sent out of the province for care so they want their units staffed adequately so they can provide care
9084910 eastern health has scheduled 14 mandatory overtime shifts at the neonatal intensive care unit for the next week alone while employers are entitled to mandate overtime if no other nurse is available scheduling it in advance as a solution to the nursing shortage is both inappropriate and unsustainable

9084922 i was always interested in ceos its been known they tend to be taller than the average population theyre good looking well spoken people and i was curious that they might have stronger chins also
9084923 warren buffett in terms of the business world also john mack and on a softer chin would be bill gates his chin is a little soft but hes a self made man he wasnt hired for the job in terms of stars george clooney arnold schwarzenegger brad pitt they all have strong chins
9084924 and thats not something you can exercise to make bigger you either have it or you dont surgerys the only option if you dont

9084934 if the middle east remains a place where freedom does not flourish it will remain a place of stagnation and resentment and violence ready for export the united states has adopted a new policy a forward strategy of freedom in the middle east a strategy that recognizes the best way to defeat the ideology that uses terror as a weapon is to spread freedom and democracy
9084935 tonight i am on the same platform as anwar ibrahim the best part of being in my line of work is the people you get to meet the heroes of our time anwar ibrahim is a hero of our time
9084936 i know of organizations being harassed and people are worried that they are identified as a threat simply because of their religious beliefs or cultural background the government can work to moderate and build trust with the people i have cited organizations such as usaid the national endowment for democracy the international republican institute the national democratic institute the peace corps and various other think tanks that take the more liberal open view without compromising the fundamentals you see there is always this difficulty that one small incident will dismantle the entire fabric of our agreement and this is really difficult for us to accept

9084984 christianity has historically been ambivalent about the benefits of pilgrimage in the spiritual life the idea of journeying to an intrinsically sacred site to draw from its spiritual energies has been highly suspect gregory of nyssa one the great theologians in the apophatic tradition roundly denounced pilgrimage you who fear the lord he said should praise him in the places where you now are change of place does not guarantee ones drawing nearer to god wherever you find yourself that is where god will come to you augustine said the same thing when he insisted that we go to god not by walking but by loving these are theologians anxious to emphasize the truth of psalm 84 5 blessed are they who have highways in their hearts an attitude of pilgrimage they thought is far more important than pilgrimage itself

9085063 i was not happy that a statement was made but the statement itself was not as bad as it could have been and the vote was 16 11 in favor of the statement with a significant minority voting for an even weaker statement
9085064 universities should be firmly committed even at times when it is against popular opinion to freedom of thought
9085065 his views and opinions in no way represent the views of this university in any aspect whatsoever
9085066 my perception is that the jewish community in the u s is moving aggressively ahead ignoring the huge disruptions jewish organizations have caused in the west now mainly via successful advocacy of massive non european immigration and in the islamic world via the treatment of palestinians by israel
9085067 i think that the entire concept of racism as a term to describe some of these websites is a misnomer
9085068 the fact is that organizations like the adl and the splc regard as racist any manifestation of ethnic identity or ethnic interests by people of european descent
9085069 many colleges throughout the united states continue to experience incidents of anti semitism
9085070 on many campuses anti israeli or anti zionist propaganda has been disseminated that includes traditional anti semitic elements including age old jewish stereotypes and defamation this has included for example anti israel literature that perpetuates the medieval anti semitic blood libel of jews slaughtering children for ritual purpose as well as anti zionist propaganda that exploits ancient stereotypes of jews as greedy aggressive overly powerful or conspiratorial
9085071 racists and demagogues have ably exploited schools commitment to free speech cloaking their propaganda in the guise of academic freedom
9085072 they have two objectives hooking the countrys future leaders on the ideas they preach and generating mainstream media coverage through the controversy that inevitably erupts over particularly incendiary events
9085073 we have a psychosis in the jewish community that is unable to co exist equally and brotherly with other human beings you can take a jew out of the ghetto but you cannot take the ghetto out of the jew
9085074 mr ali and mr al asi are part of a speaking circuit that regularly makes appearances at california campuses beyond uci and has done so for many years
9085075 its troubling because they embrace anti semitic conspiracy theories glorify violence against civilians promote antipathy toward democratic institutions and introduce fabrications that go unchecked not because they have political views critical of american policies israel or zionism
9085076 the assertion of islamic values in public and political life
9085077 considering the sort of behavior and attitudes coming from jewish religious figures it is rather less surprising to see the actions of a secular jewish state this is precisely what qualifies yahud arabic for jews for displacement dispossession and depression that is why they have been stamped with shame mortification and the wrath of the almighty
9085078 the establishment of islam as a complete way of life in america
9085079 thats one indicator that somehow these people had some type of inside information that something like this is going to happen
9085080 or else they wouldnt be there with their video cameras taking pictures of this event in progress
9085081 they the jews who died dont come up to be the same proportion of the people who live in new york or the people who are of the jewish faith who work in these buildings
9085082 jews generally speaking they dont work as trash collectors and you know hard labor jobs many of their jobs have to do with white collar positions and especially when it comes to finances
9085083 theres 4 000 to 5 000 israeli jews who were supposed to be in those two buildings on sept 11
9085084 after the dust settles we ask how many of these 4 000 to 5 000 were killed in this tragedy and they can only confirm there was one death and three to four injured did they know something we didnt know and if they did we want answers why didnt they go to work where were those 5 000 and why are you covering up these facts
9085085 he named those people who were there celebrating that the buildings were coming down and how they were zionist jews and how they were arrested and how they were let go so the story was taken off
9085086 they do things to make people think its muslims when its actually them behind the scenes
9085087 were trying to foster dialogue and truth if we found out that something was incorrect we would change it promoting falsehood would be against my faith
9085088 their views are not reflective of what is heard in any classroom or any other venue on campus
9085089 you have a monopoly over money but youre not going to have a monopoly over ideas
9085090 i dont like to use the word but muslims and christians are outsiders
9085091 if we have officials in the united states government who owe their allegiance to israel before the united states wed like to know about it especially when they are occupying some of the most sensitive positions in the government
9085092 and ill just give you one example michael chertoff the head of homeland security a department that has about 185 000 employees this person is a dual citizen hes an israeli and an american and how many other dual citizens do we have in this country who owe their allegiance to israel first and the united states second
9085093 he is an american citizen and that is the only citizenship he has ever had
9085094 rupert murdoch zionist jew zionist jew owns fox news they say that its anti semitic if you say that the zionists control the media you better get out of here old rupert is a straight up zionist jew he is put that on fox news rupert murdoch is a zionist jew
9085095 theyre definitely jewish theyre zionist jews whats the other question the media yes zionists do control the media
9085096 war and peace militarism and pacifism violence and non violence
9085097 pacifica forum acts as if its striving to become a west coast stop on the white supremacist speaker circuit
9085098 they hide behind issues of free speech and claim its important to hear what these people say they lend legitimacy to speakers who have been discredited and widely condemned by almost everybody whos taken a look at their stuff
9085099 its not just the programming its the atmosphere where expressions of anti semitism and racism and homophobia are acceptable not only acceptable but warmly regarded
9085100 especially after we experienced beginning five years ago efforts to shut us down we became devoted to free speech
9085101 we felt that the speakers needed to be heard in this community in order for the community to be better informed about public affairs in general
9085102 if you rub a substantial number of jews the wrong way youre anti semitic
9085103 in that sense i have to admit that the forum and i in particular are anti semitic
9085104 until early 2005 the forum was mostly older people often more or less progressive but na ve in the sense that they were often unable to distinguish between anti israel and anti jewish positions expressions and programming
9085105 there are many good people and also many bad people in every nation but after many years of my experience and research i came to the conclusion that among the jews for some reason there is a much larger percentage of bad people than among others
9085106 they were quite well documented and in those lectures i didnt sense any clear anti semitism
9085107 we were spellbound by the amount of facts being offered us
9085108 anelauskas began attracting people for whom anti semitism was the message they wanted to hear
9085109 even if the authors name wasnt deborah bloom after reading your opinion piece in the emerald feb 7 there is no doubt that it was written by someone who is jewish
9085110 because only from people of that peculiar tribe can we expect such talmudic hatred for humanity there is even a famous saying that wars are the jews harvest
9085111 i hope that one day you will end up as the communist kgb did in the dustbin of history
9085112 jews view non jews in a distrustful and even adversarial way
9085113 throughout history jews have time and again wielded great power to further group interests that are separate from and often contrary to those of the non jewish populations among whom they live
9085114 networking they do for their own benefit at the exclusion of non jews non jews dont network with the same intensity and this was undoubtedly a contributing factor in what we now call the holocaust
9085115 the jews in the united states are now beginning to occupy the same positions or predominance in the lucrative wealthy professions and so on that they occupied prior to nazi germany which caused their tragedy
9085116 if hes made statements that are critical of jews its not because theyre jews its because of what theyve done or what theyve said
9085117 i admit that there were some bad things done to jews during world war ii but i dont believe that everything they claim is truthful
9085118 especially in these multiracial cities like l a or washington d c im losing my eye contact
9085119 im sort of afraid even of raising my head and looking at people right in their eyes because i know they may not be of my species
9085120 a small group of attendees with a white separatist preoccupation was attracted to the forum and started attending regularly
9085121 while never part of forum sessions e mailed views about race mixing blood consciousness miscegenation that tears down civilization and pollutes good races and the genocidal war against our own race began to proliferate
9085122 since pacifica forum is a public forum mariah and i had no objection to attendance by the self described white separatists and even entertained some hope of modifying their views
9085123 however we could not allow them any control of programming in a forum with which our names were regularly associated orval declined to exclude their influence in programming decisions and we thereupon formally dissociated ourselves
9085124 the university is committed to free speech and pacifica forums use of the space does not reflect a university position on topics that they present
9085125 the way jews in this town have treated the forum i must confess that im being impelled quite against my wishes to see in the jewish community a lot of unsavory behavior
9085126 so ive undergone a transformation somewhat in the direction of becoming an anti semite
9085127 he had been somewhere he wasnt supposed to be doing something he wasnt supposed to be doing and he fell into a cabinet
9085128 when my parents rolled up my character they didnt get any 18s
9085129 we hope to achieve awareness and to show the other side of the story that has not been told
9085130 there are people who have actually gone to israel and seen it happen in front of them theyve been through checkpoints
9085131 its showing how it is in israel when they try to cross the line
9085132 if you watch the mainstream media in europe in britain or in france this stuff is like common knowledge its not really up for dispute
9085133 panel by panel its a complete misrepresentation misinformation disinformation propaganda lies hearsay
9085134 all this is doing is creating tension on campus and creating a great divide between jewish and muslim students
9085135 witness in palestine a jewish american woman in the occupied territories
9085136 i dont know if its our immediate future its something we talk about every few months
9085137 its something we would never take lightly and just say that would be fun its a lot of work and we recognize that
9085138 in a way we want to be selfish because we love our life but we know how much that adds to it
9085139 if they would be as pretty as brad and angelinas kids we might
9085140 eastenders tonight was disgusting my wife was physically sick and my son of 13 years old was brought to tears
9085141 i never read such nonsense this is what britain is like today and if you cant face up to that then someone must
9085142 while we acknowledge that this was a particularly dramatic episode we were very careful to make sure that any actual violence was implied rather than explicit and it was made clear from the outset that jases life was in serious jeopardy
9085143 we do appreciate that some viewers found the images of jases dead body uncomfortable however in trying to fully convey jays loss and depth of emotion we felt it was necessary for viewers to see what he was seeing we understand that some viewers were upset but we signalled the nature of the content of the episode through the pre programme continuity announcement and billings
9085144 they dont want to recognize the existence of art in our society and thats appalling
9085145 im here with all my peers to say no we exist and culture is an essential good
9085146 culture is the expression of a people of a nation
9085147 attacking it like the tories are doing shows they are ideologically short sighted
9085148 thats dangerous we cant allow politicians to determine what is written what is seen what dances are allowed what songs are tolerable

9085186 theres also this issue that on april 18th she gave birth to a baby with downs syndrome children with downs syndrome require an awful lot of attention the role of vice president it seems to me would take up an awful lot of her time and it raises the issue of how much time will she have to dedicate to her newborn child
9085187 thats a very good question and i guess my guess is that perhaps the line inside the mccain campaign would be if it were a man being picked who also had a baby but you know four months ago with downs syndrome would you ask the same question

9085191 the area became known for its weaving industry on 30 june 1787 a meeting of weavers was held on glasgow green their wages had dropped because of the increased importation of cheaper foreign textiles most of the workers decided to take strike action although some accepted lower wages and carried on working the dispute came to a head on 3 september 1787 when violence erupted after some striking weavers tried to seize materials from weavers who had carried on working the military were called in and a detachment of the 39th regiment of foot opened fire on the demonstrators six of the men killed at the scene were locally called martyrs and some of them were buried in the calton cemetery off the main london road the families of the men could not afford a headstone although a century later a memorial was raised to commemorate their actions
9085192 the area has experienced sectarian tensions for generations the orange order have a particular foothold in this area and there are also irish republican organisations present this is reflected albeit much declined in modern times in gang and sectarian related graffiti in the 1960s an area of the calton was known locally as tongland prominently marked out as such by graffiti tongland appears in gillies mackinnons 1995 movie small faces

9085258 i know of organizations being harassed and people are worried that they are identified as a threat simply because of their religious beliefs or cultural background the government can work to moderate and build trust with the people i have cited organizations such as usaid the national endowment for democracy the international republican institute the national democratic institute the peace corps and various other think tanks that take the more liberal open view without compromising the fundamentals you see there is always this difficulty that one small incident will dismantle the entire fabric of our agreement and this is really difficult for us to accept

9085261 some of them will be chosen to continue on within the time travel program if you and i also teach them the bi location process in secret they will test well enough to be chosen your group can then infiltrate the organization
9085262 they will stay alive as long as they know we are coming they have told me that we will need between one and two years to get your group trained and ready that means you will all be medics by then
9085263 when will i be able to talk with my parents like you and crow do
9085264 your coming initiation should assist in that process in the meantime keep practicing your meditations and exercises

9085269 melanie becca and nikki are the only ones left that are training newbies that quickly they are trying to get their last newbies right now no one else is trying to train that fast and the problem will go away when they become journeymen it is not right to punish them for being good trainers we did not punish you or rafe
9085270 it is an effective system and we are inclined to keep things the way they are
9085271 so what has been happening with the city council this past month
9085272 last months meeting was cancelled the mayor contacted us and said they were not ready for a meeting yet the mayor had dark circles under his eyes and looked a lot older than i remembered this must be pretty hard on him
9085273 its not a toy rafe there have been several air sled deaths
9085274 they watch us like a hawk i cant get away with anything
9085275 but i am going to check out some of those forbidden areas that are marked on this map though maybe i will have something interesting to add by next month

9085291 at least i have all my hair and dont have to take out my frustration over my impotence baldness and low iq on people i dont even know
9085292 what do we call men who date younger women men
9085293 18 last year and if i attract younger men what is the harm that doesnt mean i need to be called something that is taking away one of the herd from the rest of the herd presumably younger women
9085294 i or someone i know wanted to fuck an older woman once so theres nothing wrong with the word cougar
9085295 im so pathetic i cant get people my own age and have to prey on those too young and dumb and horny to care
9085296 just you try to spend one day as a woman and then you will understand
9085297 i would much rather be called a cougar than the male equivalent cradle robber or dirty old man
9085298 older women can date any younger guy they want but if theyre being a creep about it theyre gonna get called names
9085299 i decided to go tell the guy i was really impressed with his kit and that he should definitely keep the look up no matter what anyone says apparently though my sarcasm didnt make its way through and some bald dickfore that was hanging out with the guy took my completely backhanded compliment to mean i was interested in the faux motorboatin deer huntin jim beam swillin trucker the bald guy made some hand signal
9085300 did you not get the part about this guy not getting that i was being sarcastic but thinking i was hitting on the dude that means he was shaming me for talking to a dude that was younger than me

9085335 pero hindi yata tama na itago niya satin kung ano talaga sya ginawa nya kong tanga
9085336 naron na ko mali na yung ginawa nya kung mali lahat naman tayo nagkakamali siguro nga mali na paglihiman ka nya pero siguradong pinagsisisihan na nya yon ngayon bakit kasi hindi mo sya bigyan ng pagkakataon na magpaliwanag hindi yang ganyan na isip ka nang isip kung bakit
9085337 rico sabihin mo nga sakin mahal mo ba talaga si lia

9085351 hey we bring money into the economy we give people jobs our companies create an eco system that goes beyond the walls of our factories and offices creating further employment and income in services retail and what have you and on the issue of land acquisition typically people make more out of their lands from selling it than they ever would earn from it in their lifetimes plus they usually end up being employed in their own backyards than having to leave their roots and travel to far off places for employment
9085352 if it wasnt for private sector enterprise and capitalism wed be exactly where we were twenty years ago a deprived dissatisfied bunch of global nobodies lacking confidence to stand up or stand out in any arena just waiting for that house or telephone allotment to materialise bribing or suffering incompetent and arrogant babus for the simple things of life
9085353 i have to go but im going to yell at him
9085354 i remember being at the tokyo motor show in the mid 1990s and talking about the environment
9085355 politicians battle corporates corporates battle the administration the administration battles the people the people battle well everyone
9085356 when i picked you up you were like oh phooey i burned the darn muffins
9085357 im proud to say that these folks are much less influential than they used to be
9085358 if you dont like this country then why dont you move
9085359 and i thank you senator mccain and mrs mccain for the confidence that you have placed in me senator i am honored to be chosen as your running mate i will be honored to serve next to the next president of the united states
9085360 i know that when senator mccain gave me this opportunity he had a short list of highly qualified men and women and to have made that list at all it was a privilege
9085361 first there are a few people whom i would like you to meet i want to start with my husband todd and todd and i are actually celebrating our 20th anniversary today and i promised him a little surprise for the anniversary present and hopefully he knows that i did deliver
9085362 and then we have as after my husband who is a lifelong commercial fisherman lifetime alaskan hes a production operator
9085363 along the way todd and i have shared many blessings and four out of five of them are here with us today
9085364 next to todd is our daughter bristol another daughter willow our youngest daughter piper and over in their arms is our son trig a beautiful baby boy he was born just in april his name is trig paxson van palin
9085365 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case today
9085366 i was then appointed ethics commissioner and chairman of the alaska oil and gas conservation commission and when i found corruption there i fought it hard and i held the offenders to account
9085367 when oil and gas prices went up so dramatically and the state revenues followed with that increase i sent a large share of that revenue directly back to the people of alaska and we are now were now embarking on a 40 billion natural gas pipeline to help lead america to energy independence
9085368 i signed major ethics reforms and i appointed both democrats and independents to serve in my administration
9085369 well its always though safer in politics to avoid risk to just kind of go along with the status quo
9085370 now no one expects us to agree on everything whether in juneau or in washington but we are expected to govern with integrity and good will and clear convictions and a servants heart
9085371 now no leader in america has shown these qualities so clearly or presents so clear a threat to business as usual in washington as senator john s
9085372 and this is a moment that requires resolve and toughness and strength of heart in the american president
9085373 and im going to make sure nobody does forget that in his campaign there is only one candidate who has truly fought for america and that man is john mccain
9085374 this is a moment this is a moment when great causes can be won and great threats overcome depending on the judgment of our next president in a dangerous world it is john mccain who will lead americas friends and allies in preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons
9085375 it was john mccain who cautioned long ago about the harm that russian aggression could do to georgia and to other small democratic neighbors and to the world oil markets
9085376 it was senator mccain who refused to hedge his support for our troops in iraq regardless of the political costs and you know what as the mother of one of those troops and as the commander of alaskas national guard thats the kind of man i want as our commander in chief
9085377 profiles in courage they can be hard to come by these days you know so often we just find them in books but next week when we nominate john mccain for president were putting one on the ballot
9085378 to serve as vice president beside such a man would be the privilege of a lifetime and its fitting that this trust has been given to me 88 years almost to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9085379 i think as well today of two other women who came before me in national elections i cant begin this great effort without honoring the achievements of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course senator hillary clinton who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign
9085380 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9085381 my fellow americans come join our cause join our cause and help our country to elect a great man the next president of the united states and i thank you and i god bless you i say and god bless america thank you

9085401 not be signed in its present form or in any other form
9085402 from a legal standpoint you have the moa initialed by the panel and if you withdraw the tro that initial means that under international law they are compelled to sign it
9085403 because if it had been signed it would have been a binding international obligation malaysia can compel us to change our constitution
9085404 you see the danger that could have happened had that moa been signed you are risking dismemberment of the country on your conjecture that thats not an international obligation
9085405 you mean to say you asked them to witness an event that has no legal significance
9085406 why are there many versions of the actions of the president why is its language changing
9085407 no matter what the sc decides the government will not sign moa
9085408 since it wont be signed it has been set aside but not the peace process
9085409 this moa is hardly recognizable international law and standards we cant even reach a proper characterization
9085410 both tickets have experience plus new energy the gop has it the way should be with experience at the top

9085413 if we consider muslims as ips then the pampangos pangalatoks ilocanos everybody would be considered an ip
9085414 there was grave abuse of discretion in considering them different from the rest

9085416 you see the danger that could have happened had that moa been signed
9085417 if the philippines were to be dragged before the international court of justice the court could not compel it to do anything if it refuses to submit to the courts jurisdiction
9085418 you mean to say you asked them to witness an event that has no legal significance
9085419 if the moa had been signed the state would have been required to change the countrys internal laws in order to comply with it
9085420 because if it had been signed it would have been a binding international obligation malaysia can compel us to change our constitution
9085421 in its present form why are there many versions of the actions of the president why is its language changing
9085422 this moa is hardly recognizable international law and standards we cant even reach a proper characterization

9085425 john mccain is one of the most loyal and accomplished us senators in history obama gave a speech in 2004 maybe america is trying to apologize for all of the terrible things that have happened to the blacks over the years maybe it is a guilt complex maybe he is just to cool to resist
9085426 ill take a third term of bush before a second term of carter
9085427 the mccain campaign had make little secret of the fact that they wanted to pick a woman as the arizona senators running mate believing that the rift caused by the protracted primary between barack obama and hillary rodham clinton gave them an opportunity to pick up scads of disgruntled women

9085445 lol you dont get to see the final levels on easy retard
9085446 power control is key to the mobile and network success if the ue requires too much downlink power then the base station or node b can run out of transmitter power and this is what was happening as you get more ues on the cell the noise floor rises and the cell has to compensate by ramping up its power to the ues
9085447 if the ue power control algorithm is faulty then they will demand more power from the cell than is necessary and with multiple users this can cause the cell transmitter to run out of power the net result is that some ues will drop their call i have seen the dropped call graphs that correspond to the iphone launch and when the 2 0 2 firmware was released the increase in dropped calls
9085448 the power control issue will also have an effect on the data throughput because the higher the data rate the more power the node b transmitter requires to transmit if the ues have poor power control and are taking more power than is necessary then it will sap the networks ability to deliver high speed data
9085449 this is one of the reasons why at amp t has been sending text messages to users to persuade them to upgrade to the 2 0 2 software in a mixed environment where users are running 2 0 2 0 1 and 2 0 2 the power control problems of 2 0 and 2 0 1 will affect the 2 0 2 users
9085450 it is not the network that is fault but the interaction of the bad power control algorithm in 2 0 and 2 0 1 software and the network that is at fault the sooner everybody is running 2 0 2 software the better things will be having seen the graphs the 2 0 2 software has already started to make difference

9085477 hanya 30 persen dari keseluruhan bemo yang beroperasi sisanya sudah berubah bentuk berubah fungsi berganti menjadi plat hitam atau dijual pemiliknya
9085478 dari 100 tempat duduk itu hanya 2 kursi yang laku
9085479 kami disubsidi rp 30 ribu per kendaraan per hari selama tiga bulan ternyata sepi penumpang supir tetap bekerja karena disubsidi setelah tiga bulan dan subsidi dicabut supir tak sanggup mungkin karena waktu itu sepeda motor juga sudah banyak
9085480 tak hanya itu saya perhatikan angkutan umum jurusan abiansemal taman ayun dan kukuh kediri yang dulu ada sekarang sudah mati
9085481 karena tarif naik belum tentu 100 orang ini akan tetap naik angkutan umum bisa jadi mereka beralih moda transportasi
9085482 makin tua umur kendaraan makin besar diskon yang diberikan kami berharap bbn dan pkb hingga nol persen pemasukan dan pengeluaran kami nggak pernah cocok merugi terus
9085483 tidak dalam bentuk pengurangan harga bahan bakar tapi membayar biaya operasional kendaraan yang nilainya didapat dari masyarakat pengguna dan pemerintah menanggung selisihnya
9085484 operator tetap menerima hasil yang diharapkan masyarakat menerima layanan yang diharapkan ini bagian tanggung jawab pemerintah
9085485 kalau jumlah ini naik sampai dengan 35 persen pemerintah nggak perlu keluar subsidi hampir di seluruh dunia tidak ada transportasi umum yang tidak disubsidi pemerintah seperti prancis dan belanda busway di jakarta juga disubsidi pemerintah seperti jalan dan halte
9085486 lebih baik diganti dengan kendaraan yang baru dengan catatan semua orang yang terlibat di operasional sebelumnya seperti supir dan pemilik harus masuk ke dalam sistem yang baru
9085487 jangan menghitung besarnya uang yang keluar saja kompesasi bagi pemerintah penggunaan bahan bakar berkurang polusi berkurang dan pengurangan waktu jika sebelumnya kita melewati jalan diponegoro dari ujung ke ujung selama 10 menit setelah itu menjadi lebih lancar mungkin menjadi 7 menit nah kalau itu dikalikan pendapatan tiap menit di denpasar kalikan dengan jumlah orang yang lewat itu bernilai uang juga

9085504 doordat discounters nu mee in de dans springen bereiken we een steeds groter publiek wat uiteraard ons doel is zoveel mogelijk producenten uit het zuiden een toegang bieden tot onze markten
9085505 ons keurmerk moet wettelijk beschermd worden daar moeten de komende jaren stappen voor gedaan worden
9085506 de kleine producenten moeten zich verenigen over alle continenten om het hoofd te bieden aan flo de fairtrade labelling organisatie en aan max havelaar met als doel een eigen label te cre ren maar momenteel kunnen we niet aan hen voorbij
9085507 de relaties tussen de nieuwe koningen van de eerlijke handel en hun affiliees zijn niet meer dezelfde max havelaar dat 75 van de europese fairtrademarkt in handen heeft werkt samen met mcdonalds en heeft als ambitie om goud en toeristische reizen te certificieren de koffieproducenten van hun kant hebben hard strijd moeten leveren met de fairtrade labelling organizations flo om de aankoopprijs van de fairtradekoffie aan te passen die was al sinds 1988 dezelfde gebleven het was nodig om vanuit mexico over nicaragua over peru druk te zetten om dit te bekomen pas onlangs werden de prijzen aangepast naar 156 dollars zo vertelt co perant isaias martinez
9085508 if the question was asked what is the best way to help the farmers 4 years ago i would have said fair trade organic today i dont necessarily believe that organic certification and fair trade certification are necessary they help but what is most important is just guaranteeing that the supply chain is sustainable and it has to end at the consumer
9085509 the fair trade system is really there to make sure the farmers are getting a fair price for their raw commodities thats the baseline principal of fair trade in organic cacao the baseline price is 2 100 dollars per metric ton for beans and in my opinion thats a low price were paying upwards of 3 500 dollars per metric ton for our cacao actually im going to a farm in madagascar and im paying 4 500 dollars per metric ton twice the fair trade base price whats the point of this particular farm joining the flo system sometimes it seems theres no need
9085510 you cant apply the same answer to every location fairtrade as an example they have a system that says the base price for cacao is say 2 100 dollars per metric ton regardless of a minimum wage law in a country the standard of living in a country the standard of living in el salvador is going to be very different than the ivory coast can you actually take one system and apply it in each country where the standards in each country are different i dont think so its got to be a case by case experiment its got to be adjustable there has to be that flexibility
9085511 for the last 50 years our consumption model has been based around low cost goods low retail price anytime you have a low retail price were squeezing the farmer or the manufacturer down lower and lower so they cant be sustainable in their own livelihood

9085517 no man is going to look at an overweight woman walking down the street
9085518 i became overweight bite by bite after having my three boys i started eating the same foods and portions as my men so why was i surprised when i was almost the same weight as my men
9085519 im so glad i lost the weight now my husband cant keep his hands off me he pays so much attention to me we go out on dates again and were in love again
9085520 and my sons arent ashamed to been seen with me anymore they just love to hug me now
9085521 are you sure i cant sell you 10 weeks for the price of 5
9085522 and i allaah created not the jinns and humans except that they should worship me alone
9085523 and that you fast it is better for you if only you know
9085524 that you should magnify allaah for having guided you so that you may be grateful to him
9085525 but if any of you is ill or on a journey the same number should be made up from other days
9085526 until i was at the mountain where i heard loud voices i asked what are these voices they said this is the howling of the people of hellfire then i was taken to another place and i saw people hanging from their hamstrings with the corners of their mouths torn and dripping with blood i said who are these they said the people who broke their fast before it was the proper time to do so i e before the time of iftaar
9085527 among the believers it is well established that whoever does not fast in ramadaan without a valid excuse is worse than an adulterer or drunkard they doubt whether he is even a muslim at all and they regard him as a heretic and profligate
9085528 if a person does not fast in ramadaan knowing that it is haraam but making it halaal for himself to do so kill him and if he does it because he is immoral but believes it is haraam then punish him for not fasting
9085529 except for fasting which is only for my sake and i will reward him for it
9085530 o lord i prevented him from his food and physical desires during the day so let me intercede for him
9085531 when ramadaan begins the gates of paradise are opened and the gates of hell are closed and the devils are put in chains
9085532 whoever fasts ramadaan out of faith and with the hope of reward all his previous sins will be forgiven
9085533 suhoor is blessed food and it involves being different from the people of the book what a good suhoor for the believer is dates
9085534 the people will be fine so long as they do not delay iftaar
9085535 the prophet peace and blessings of allaah be upon him used to break his fast with fresh dates before praying if fresh dates were not available he would eat dried dates if dried dates were not available he would have a few sips of water
9085536 dhahaba al zama wabtallat al urooq wa thabat al ajru in sha allaah thirst is gone veins are flowing again and the reward is certain in sha allaah
9085537 when any of you is fasting let him not commit sin
9085538 whoever does not stop speaking falsehood and acting in accordance with it allaah has no need of him giving up his food and drink
9085539 it may be that a fasting person gets nothing from his fast except hunger
9085540 if someone fights him or insults him he should say i am fasting i am fasting
9085541 the son of adam fills no worse vessel than his stomach
9085542 the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him was the most generous of people in doing good and he was most generous of all in ramadaan when jibreel met with him and he used to meet him every night in ramadaan and teach him the quraan the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him was more generous in doing good than a blowing wind
9085543 in paradise there are rooms whose outside can be seen from the inside and the inside can be seen from the outside allaah has prepared them for those who feed the poor who are gentle in speech who fast regularly and who pray at night when people are asleep
9085544 whoever gives food to a fasting person with which to break his fast will have a reward equal to his without it detracting in the slightest from the reward of the fasting person
9085545 what is meant is that he should feed him until he is satisfied
9085546 you are to me as the back of my mother
9085547 fast when you see it the new moon and break your fast when you see it
9085548 we used to make our children fast and we would make them a toy made out of wool if any one of them started to cry for food we would give them that toy to play with until it was time to break the fast
9085549 o you who believe ward off from yourselves and your families a fire hell whose fuel is men and stones over which are appointed angels stern and severe who disobey not from executing the commands they receive from allaah but do that which they are commanded
9085550 so whoever of you sights the crescent on the first night of the month of ramadaan i
9085551 and whoever is ill or on a journey the same number of days on which one did not observe sawm must be made up from other days
9085552 and whoever fears allaah and keeps his duty to him he will make a way for him to get out from every difficulty and he will provide him from sources he could never imagine
9085553 whoever dies owing some fasts let his heir fast on his behalf
9085554 and as for those who can fast with difficulty e
9085555 this has not been abrogated it refers to the old man and the old woman who cannot fast so they should feed a poor person for every day
9085556 in the morning you are going to meet your enemy and not fasting will make you stronger so do not fast
9085557 there is no fast for the person who did not intend to fast from the night before
9085558 the person who is observing a voluntary fast has the choice either to complete the fast or to break it
9085559 there is no fasting for the one who does not have the intention to fast from the night before
9085560 once night comes from there and the day disappears from there and the sun has set the fasting person should break his fast
9085561 if he forgets and eats and drinks then let him complete his fast for allaah has fed him and given him to drink
9085562 he does not have to make the fast up later or offer expiation kafaarah
9085563 whoever vomits unintentionally does not have to make up the fast later on but whoever vomits on purpose does have to make up the fast
9085564 there is nothing wrong with tasting vinegar or anything that one wishes to buy
9085565 allaah has permitted you to eat and drink so long as there is any doubt in your mind
9085566 allaah has lifted the obligation of fasting and part of the prayer from the traveller and he has lifted the obligation of fasting from the pregnant and breastfeeding woman
9085567 in the case of a man who has intercourse with his wife during the day in ramadaan whilst she is sleeping she does not have to offer expiation
9085568 no woman should fast when her husband is present except with his permission
9085569 jika allah membukakan pintu makrifat bagimu jangan hiraukan mengapa itu terjadi sementara amalmu amat sedikit allah membukakannya bagimu hanyalah karena dia ingin memperkenalkan diri kepadamu tidakkah engkau mengerti bahwa makrifat itu adalah anugerah nya kepadamu sedangkan amal adalah pemberianmu maka betapa besar perbedaan antara persembahanmu kepada allah dan karunia nya kepadamu

9085580 it is nice that we can still maintain our contracts in microsoft word and ensure the every one in the organization is using the correct version of the contract
9085581 wow you mean i dont have to manually create my contracts any more this is fantastic
9085582 my reps are really excited about this solution and i love the fact that it frees up more of their time to spend with customers rather than filling out paper work
9085583 they are probably one of the most fantastic teams ive ever worked with and have been fast with their response excellent at quickly troubleshooting and just amazing patient and accommodating we really appreciate the fantastic work that theyve been doing
9085584 i have been stuck here a long time i want to let go how do i do it
9085585 i often feel very alone even though i have a spouse and kids who love me i do try to overcome some of the emotion but sometimes it feels like im struggling to keep my head above water i keep feeling that there are a lot of things i cant let go of to get where i want and need to be with god i dont want to stay where im at i want to move forward with my life my marriage my family and to give my whole life to god
9085586 i signed up for this next session i think it will help me i want to fly im ready
9085587 we always correct that way of thinking saying no no the turbines are colliding with the bats
9085588 but this has really changed the way we think about it in that the bats arent colliding with the turbines the turbines arent colliding with the bats its actually an undetectable hazard
9085589 they didnt look like anything had happened to them they were laying on the ground with no broken wings no other sorts of injuries you would expect if they were struck by these large blades
9085590 she examined bat lungs under the microscope and she found the same things we had seen
9085591 the blood vessels in the lungs had actually burst and the lungs were filling full of fluid filling full of blood and all those are injuries consistent with barotraumas or with flying through an area where the pressure drops dramatically what happens then is it makes the lungs overexpand and causes breaks in the small blood vessels around the lungs and essentially bats are dying from drowning
9085592 this is very similar to what happens to deep sea divers who come up too quickly
9085593 didnt have the large sample that we did and didnt do daily carcass searches they werent out there every day finding the really fresh bats so they could then look at the damage to the lungs
9085594 the bat fatalities at wind farms have been so difficult to understand and this makes sense of it in a very straightforward way
9085595 in a wind tunnel we recreate conditions that mimic what happens when bats fly we just shift the movement of the bat relative to the air the relative speed of air to bat stays the same at the fast moving ends of the turbine blades the wind speeds are much much higher
9085596 bird lungs are more rigid and more tube like and they have continual air flow that makes them less susceptible to their lungs over expanding
9085597 the older turbines with the lattice towers or the ladder like towers the big birds of prey like bald eagles and golden eagles like to perch on them and they make great perching habitat and nesting habitats for birds and then they were struck by the blades
9085598 so now its a solid tower like a mast and theres no more places for these birds to nest or perch so they kind of fixed that
9085599 i dont think theres anything anyone could have done and theres nothing we can really do on the ground either if you find a bat that has been injired but not fatallly killed by the decompression they die very shortly after even with lots of tender loving care
9085600 we know that there are more bats active in low wind speeds and we know that wind turbines dont create that much electricity in low wind speeds so what we have started to do is experiment with shutting turbines off in low wind speeds to see if that effects the number of bats killed all of the initial studies are very promising that if you shut turbines off in low wind speeds during fall migration when the majority of these fatalities occur you can actually reduce bat fatalities
9085601 were still experimenting with which wind speeds are optimal and how many fatalities
9085602 we dont know what the population sizes of bats are theyre migratory bats just a few species that are being killed and not at every wind energy site
9085603 so were having a hard time getting a handle on what the impact is
9085604 theyre one of the only animals that fly at night and eat flying insects like moths some of the moths are really important agricultural pests like gypsy moths and spruce budworm that bats eat large numbers of because these bats are migratory and they migrate from canada potentially to mexico what happens to bats in canada could have implications for ecosytems in mexico or the southern united states
9085605 so it really is a bigger issue than some bats dying at turbines in alberta
9085606 transforming the ghostly neutrino into an active tool of research
9085607 the most exciting finding is that when we compare the cells from the young animals to the old animals we normally find garbage accumulation of damage but when we compare this with our animals in which we have added this extra copy of this gene we found that the cells were clean
9085608 by removing these damaged products by maintaining the cleaning systems inside the cells we were able to preserve the function of a whole organ so if we can do that in the whole body we hope that we will be able to have very healthy animals and of course wed like to have healthy people even more than healthy animals
9085609 even the typical reactions that you have in your body produce oxidation or damage of proteins sort of like proteins getting rusty and your cells eliminate these rusty proteins and this is what guarantees that your cells work properly and dont accumulate any kind of garbage
9085610 maybe there is hope for all of us with wrinkles
9085611 this is a larger change in the acidity of the ocean than has been observed through geological time for at least 20 million years
9085612 were changing the acidity of the oceans faster than the organisms have ever experienced
9085613 we had approached all of this research with the idea that the oceans are performing a service for mankind
9085614 we put the equivalent of 118 billion vw bugs worth of carbon into the oceans
9085615 half of all the co2 thats accumulated in the oceans has actually remained in the upper 400 meters the upper 1300 feet those upper layers of the ocean
9085616 what we found was we were getting levels of acidification up onto the shelf in these upwelling regions that were much more dramatic than we expected to see
9085617 theres a real question of whether or not they can continue to survive

9085665 what should be an obvious fact architecture is not building buildings are objects and the act of building leads to such objects but architecture is something else it is the way we think and talk about buildings how we represent them how we build them this is architecture more generally architecture is a way of representing shaping and perhaps even offering critical alternatives to the human made environment in fact buildings are not enough they are the tombs of architecture the residue of the desire to make another world a better world and a world open to possibilities beyond the everyday in a concrete sense architecture is that which allows us to be at home in the world
9085666 the challenge of the 11th underlines betsky is to collect and encourage experimentation in architecture such experimentation can take the form of momentary constructions visions of other worlds or the building blocks of a better world this biennale does not want to present buildings that are already in existence and can be enjoyed in real life it does not want to propose abstract solutions to social problems but wants to see if architecture by experimenting in and on the real world can offer some concrete forms or seductive images

9085690 so its not like i didnt appreciate it i always did and i always felt very grateful for it but at the same time it compromised my own ability to just be a normal human being and unless youve lived that experience you have no idea what thats like
9085691 it was the last year when i was in television that i decided that i couldnt carry on at that pace and i thought that it was the appropriate time for me to try and have a personal life and also that it was enough you know
9085692 had you been there for even an hour or two you would have understood it and looked at me and gone well i dont know how youre dealing with this madness
9085693 so it just seemed like the right time and for me i just knew that it was necessary for my own survival
9085694 everybody asks me about it i understand peoples curiosity about it i dont mind talking about it because im very proud of the work that i did and the impact that ive had on two generations
9085695 im really comfortable in my own skin and i love the fact that i get to go out and celebrate the music and do it with people it had an impact on and who really care about it
9085696 ive reached out and tried to help him over the years and you know i dont really communicate much with him because i dont know that there is any real purpose in doing so i love and care for him i just cant you cant help someone who isnt willing to help themselves
9085697 i heard it was very upsetting and i dont ever want to think about him in that regard
9085698 ask and it will be given to you seek and you shall find knock and the door will be opened for you
9085699 if you are the son of god tell these stones to become bread
9085700 it is written man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of god
9085701 he will command his angels concerning you and they will lift you up in their hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone
9085702 it is also written do not put the lord your god to the test again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor all this i will give you
9085703 when you fast do not look somber as the hypocrites do for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full
9085704 do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal
9085705 yet they seek me day by day and delight to know my ways
9085706 behold you fast for contention and strife and to strike with a wicked fist
9085707 is it a fast like this which i choose a day for a man to humble himself
9085708 is it not to divide your bread with the hungry
9085709 ask all the people of the land and the priests when you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years was it really for me that you fasted 8 i tell you he will see that they get justice and quickly however when the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth

9085757 this plan to raise taxes is the exact opposite of what we need right now when the economy is down government needs to leave money in the small business cash registers not seize more of it
9085758 ive said from the beginning that we must continue to lower and flatten the tax burden
9085759 as a rule i think property tax is the most unfair tax we have as a state and i for one think we should continue working to eliminate this unfair tax not looking for new ways to increase this burden
9085760 i do not understand why during this critical economic slowdown the state superintendent would be proposing a new tax on business and industry as a source of funding
9085761 we must move to a per pupil formula we must also eliminate the bureaucratic friction at both the state and local levels that results in less than fifty cents of every dollar from getting into the classroom those are the changes we need not higher property taxes
9085762 that money could be going to classrooms instead of museums and chitlin struts but tax and spenders assume when they run out of money theyll just get more from you i will fight any legislation seeking to take more money from your pocket

9085773 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced america now is not the time for small plans now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy michelle and i are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education and i will not settle for an america where some kids dont have that chance ill invest in early childhood education ill recruit an army of new teachers and pay them higher salaries and give them more support and in exchange ill ask for higher standards and more accountability and we will keep our promise to every young american if you commit to serving your community or your country we will make sure you can afford a college education now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable accessible health care for every single american if you have health care my plan will lower your premiums if you dont youll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves and as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses and the time to protect social security for future generations and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal days work because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons

9085779 picking her sounds like they are over estimating the potential effect of disenfranchised hillary supporters the die hard number is insignificant at best
9085780 just heard wasserman shultz on msnbc lay out the case against palin no experience
9085781 shes just like clinton only without the experience story issues and talent
9085782 by the way does anyone else find that checking the
9085783 all the positives listed by fred may look good on paper in the same way lieberman looked good on paper to gore
9085784 yeah im curious to see if shell ever actually appear on the campaign trail
9085785 the biggest organization the obama campaign has run the obama campaign
9085786 but shes younger and better looking and less experienced than carly
9085787 ha you said obama wasnt experienced but you have a one term governor as your vp
9085788 but palin is the vp on the ticket mccain is the experience on the ticket but also will have the benefit of palin bringing fresh eyes and change and if palin is inexperienced then so is obama would you rather have the inexperience part of the ticket be the vice president or the president
9085789 will this remind some folks of the first mrs mccain and what a jerk he was there
9085790 and if palin is inexperienced then so is obama would you rather have the inexperience part of the ticket be the vice president or the president
9085791 from my perspective the angriest clinton supporters frame clintons loss as a a more experienced woman being by passed for a less experienced man and b this choice to eliminate clinton from the running as made by a party that insulted and derogated her and her supporters by association incl
9085792 the mccain campaign is hoping and praying that someone will say that palin is unready for the job
9085793 let a democrat say that an executive with 2 years of experience and no foreign policy expertise isnt ready for the presidency oh pretty please because you know what im going to do im going to take that soundbite put it in an ad slap obamas mug up there and run it over and over and over again
9085794 its going to be laughable to hear mccain assail obamas supposed lack of experience after naming the first term governor only one and a half years into her term of the 47th largest state to be his running mate palin lacks any foreign policy experience and is bereft of even the two core areas of policy expertise that governors are supposed to bring to a ticket ag policy alaska doesnt have much in the way of traditional agriculture and urban affairs anchorage is the 65th largest city in the us behind giants such as corpus christi shes easily the least experienced running mate in recent memory
9085795 is assumed to be the primary caregiver of a large family
9085796 but why would i ever support someone who believes the opposite of hillary on every issue
9085797 no one says palins experience is off limits for gods sake but that doesnt mean you need to be dismissive and make beauty queen remarks bring it up respectfully
9085798 i know hillary clinton hillary clinton is a friend of mine you maam are no hillary clinton
9085799 gee maybe the reason obama passed up on all these women was that he thought a black female ticket would be too much change whereas mccain had the balls to pick a woman ergo i like mccain
9085800 damn whyd he pass over all those more qualified older women for her
9085801 you have to think that a significant number of women voters and all it has to be is 1 of the electorate will think to themselves
9085802 obama has just as many years in elected office as hillary
9085803 oh and fred will never be anything more than an al wanna be
9085804 its a cynical move based on the idea that women vote for women not for candidates that actually represent their views
9085805 we really like her but i dont know how she translates
9085806 what person wouldnt do everything they could for a relative and children in this situation we should do it for everyone but you cant ignore your own nephew being tazered because you happen to be governor
9085807 ha ha miss congeniality who gave her kids quirky names and hunts moose
9085808 bad for obama as everything always is by the msm

9085830 a man planted a vineyard rented it to some farmers
9085831 then the owner of the vineyard said what shall i do i will send my son whom i love perhaps they will respect him
9085832 but when the tenants saw him they talked the matter over this is the heir they said lets kill him and the inheritance will be ours
9085833 what then will the owner of the vineyard do to them lk 20 16 he will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others
9085834 then what is the meaning of that which is written

9085838 koufax lifted his cap ran his fingers through his black hair then pulled the cap back down fussing at the bill

9085843 i assumed you meant the puttanesca i guess it could meant a lot of things
9085844 cmon you dont expect me to believe that you never think about her do you
9085845 i dont expect that at all im just not thinking about her now
9085846 thats natural it doesnt bother me one bit id be worried if you didnt
9085847 if you think we need to i can go either way
9085848 and he was leaving for his mission he was going to costa rica he would have been gone for two years we couldnt wait that long
9085849 why did you have to get married why didnt you guys just do it
9085850 because we were mormon you dont just do it brad was very religious it wouldnt have mattered to me but he wouldnt have it any other way
9085851 so he couldnt wait that long he had to do it before he left
9085852 no we couldnt wait i wanted to just as much as he did maybe more
9085853 anyways we got married and we did it for three straight days and then he left
9085854 i was eighteen of course i was sad i was devastated i didnt get out of bed for a week
9085855 yes and i wanted to get on with it i didnt want to put my life on hold waiting for a future that i had no desire for you understand i wanted to get out and see things so i left
9085856 uh huh i moved to la and went to art school i couldnt stay there and wait besides after those first three days there was no way i was going to remain celibate for two years
9085857 i guess getting married to have sex is a pretty lame reason huh
9085858 i guess it just as lame as any other reason love and lust arent much different when you get right down to it
9085859 well back to brad i wrote him a letter explaining how i felt and i was surprised when he wrote back saying that he had felt the same way
9085860 after the annulment i was depressed i couldnt help it i always hate for things to come to an end
9085861 he was a pitcher for the dodgers the best untouchable
9085862 a resident at your hospital writes me a prescription i wont tell you which one
9085863 they think the babies are not human because of their size and their location
9085864 back in the day people thought babys were not humans
9085865 dont wrestle with a pig in mud because a pig likes mud
9085866 come to think of it didnt peter leitharts church just issue a statement that said in a round about way that the roman catholic mass was within the boundaries of legitimacy simply because the rcc was trinitarian
9085867 with the reformers we insist that liturgical idolatry is a most dangerous temptation and sin for many within roman catholicism and eastern orthodoxy this includes the veneration of man made images statues relics eucharistic elements the invocation of the saints as well as other practices and traditions which are not according to scripture likewise we warn all the faithful to flee those doctrines or practices which whether in doctrine or in practice undermine the fundamental and sovereign graciousness of god in salvation
9085868 on this basis we cheerfully recognize the trinitarian baptisms of roman catholic and eastern orthodox christians
9085869 result in disparaging the validity of the ordinations or sacraments of other churches that worship our triune god in the name of the lord jesus christ
9085870 you know i think youre crazy but im with you babe
9085871 your kids always thought of me as an uncle i always felt more like one of their siblings
9085872 many people will express sympathy but you dont want or need that because trig will be a joy you have to trust me on this children are the most precious and promising ingredient in this mixed up world you live in down there on earth trig is no different except he has one extra chromosome
9085873 guilt over abortion is the engine that drives the feminist movement
9085874 certainly gov palin is a self described feminist and no thats not good according to gods word and order
9085875 i wouldnt vote for a country dog catcher that wasnt pro life
9085876 brought to the throne for such a time as this
9085877 it will gain senator mccain nothing he didnt already have
9085878 hence i cannot agree that by picking palin mccain gained nothing
9085879 you can be anything you want to be even vice president
9085880 fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me fool me three times im a republican
9085881 we affirm our fundamental unity with all the saints within the body of christ including those in the roman catholic and eastern orthodox churches
9085882 faith that was once for all delivered to the saints
9085883 one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is over all and through all and in all
9085884 recognize the trinitarian baptisms of todays roman catholic and eastern orthodox christians
9085885 receive them and all others who confess this ancient faith to our celebration of the eucharist and warmly welcome them into membership in our congregation
9085886 disparaging the validity of the ordinations or sacraments of other churches that worship our triune god in the name of the lord jesus christ
9085887 from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth
9085888 would rather have pure blood with the pope than drink mere wine with the enthusiasts
9085889 we are grateful for and committed to those summaries of the faith found in the westminster confession of faith the three forms of unity and the thirty nine articles of religion
9085890 we reject views which place the ultimate infallible authority of the scriptures in competition with other sources of authority since christ is lord over all
9085891 the scriptures are the ultimate final authority all others are subordinate thereto
9085892 why a pca minister should be starting a cre church is beyond me
9085893 it mystifies me how an effective work that draws people from rome can be taken as a movement to rome
9085894 on this basis we cheerfully recognize the trinitarian baptisms of roman catholic and eastern orthodox christians receive them and all others who confess this ancient faith to our celebration of the eucharist and warmly welcome them into membership in our congregation
9085895 blessed are the double minded that realize man can serve two masters
9085896 the pca contains large numbers of overt reformed baptists having been one myself at one time same principle although the differentiation is less
9085897 you make tims point when you implicitly make equivalent the differences a pca church would have with reformed baptists whose 1689 confession is about 90 95 the wcf and rc
9085898 im still not entirely sure that is a good idea although i did wind up reformed instead of baptist when the dust settled
9085899 im still not entirely sure that is a good idea although i did wind up christian instead of presbyterian when the dust settled
9085900 yay for the reformation three cheers for luther and calvin and bucer
9085901 you make tims point when you implicitly make equivalent the differences a pca church would have with reformed baptists whose 1689 confession is about 90 95 the wcf and rc
9085902 far more serious still is the division between the church of rome and evangelical protestantism in all its forms yet how great is the common heritage which unites the roman catholic church with its maintenance of the authority of holy scripture and with its acceptance of the great early creeds to devout protestants today we would not indeed obscure the difference which divides us from rome the gulf is indeed profound but profound as it is it seems almost trifling compared to the abyss which stands between us and many ministers of our own church the church of rome may represent a perversion of the christian religion but naturalistic liberalism is not christianity at all
9085903 what we the reformed have in common with rome is some theological terminology the de fide statements of the roman church are not orthodox indeed looking at the papal encyclical cited above they are often blasphemous we do not have a common faith
9085904 it seems almost trifling compared to the abyss which stands between us and many ministers of our own church
9085905 his position was also original on the subject of the administration of baptism though serving all his ministry in churches belonging to denominations of paedo baptist belief he early abandoned the practice of infant baptism yet he did not become a baptist because he did not believe in immersion two authors in particular swayed his judgement against immersion one was charles hodge and the other b b warfield in his article the archaelogy of the mode of baptism as a result he was to say i was quite convinced that the case for infant baptism could not be proved but equally convinced that the case for immersion could not be proved in practice then he dedicated the children of believers and baptized others by sprinling upon their profession of faith the questions which he put publicly to those he baptized were usually taken from the heidelberg catechism his views on baptism almost never appeared in his public ministry partly i suppose because opposition to infant baptism would have been contrary to the trust deeds of the churches he served but certainly because of his burden to emphasize the things which all evangelicals hold in common he especially regretted that baptism had ever been made a point of denominational identity and was critical of baptism in that regard
9085906 were all alike so im as good as anyone else
9085907 and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather expose them for it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret
9085908 but avoid foolish and ignorant disputes knowing that they generate strife and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all able to teach patient in humility correcting those who are in opposition if god perhaps will grant them repentance so that they may know the truth and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil having been taken captive by him to do his will
9085909 19 for what can be known about god is plain to them because god has shown it to them 20 for his invisible attributes namely his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world in the things that have been made so they are without excuse 21 for although they knew god they did not honor him as god or give thanks to him but they became futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts were darkened 22 claiming to be wise they became fools 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things
9085910 3 the revealed specific relations between the father the son and the holy ghost show us that those relations are simultaneously ones of equality and hierarchy
9085911 human souls are created male and female they are united to and animate correspondingly male and female bodies

9086120 we are proud to reach this significant milestone and remain confident in our ability to expand to 1 2gw wafer capacity by the end of 2008
9086121 this achievement demonstrates our continued commitment to becoming the largest and lowest cost wafer producer in the solar industry
9086122 we are very pleased to establish this relationship with solarfun which will support our growing needs for the rapidly expanding activities in q cells international in this case primarily outside of europe
9086123 we aim to combine our high efficiency cells and solarfuns competitive flexible and high quality manufacturing base for solar modules to create high efficiency and cost effective module solutions for these systems we believe that close cooperation between the two parties will provide each with opportunities to grow and compete effectively in the burgeoning field of renewable solar energy
9086124 as we continue to grow our solar business and meet the growing demand for our products in korea and globally we are excited to strengthen our long term wafer supply pipeline by reaching this agreement to secure additional high quality wafers from ldk solar
9086125 the supplemental agreements inclusion of significant wafer quantities starting in 2010 reflects a significant revision to our capacity expansion strategy whereby future expansion will involve increased cell and module capacity additions relative to those for ingot and wafer
9086126 we believe that this flexible strategy will offer increased output of solar modules to achieve better market penetration under our increasingly recognized brand
9086127 these agreements with gcl silicon will greatly strengthen our silicon pipeline and support our capacity and production expansion over the next five years
9086128 with steep declining cost curves these agreements are in line with our strategy to quickly reach grid parity and extend our position as a leading global provider of solar products
9086129 wattner opted for et solar because we possess the unique combination of profound manufacturing experience and in depth epc knowledge engineering procurement construction the cooperation with investment partners such as wattner is key for our development and expansion plans in international markets
9086130 we are pleased to select becancour as the preferred site for future silicon materials expansions we look forward to a long and industrious relationship between rec and the people of quebec during the site selection and negotiation process the government of quebec particularly investissement quebec has proven to be welcoming and encouraging we also see great potential in the workforce and complimentary industries in the area
9086131 the development of this site will enable us to continue expansion of our silicon business in the most cost efficient manner and will consequently support recs further growth downstream as well as our ambitious long term cost target
9086132 were thrilled to be involved with the democratic party on its biggest stage
9086133 there is tremendous legislative support in both parties and both chambers for renewable energy and were hopeful that federal legislators see the benefits in extending the investment tax credit for renewable energy beyond 2008
9086134 there is great importance in being part of the democratic convention to showcase the practical use of solar energy to our nations leaders and also for the democratic party to set an example for clean and responsible energy use

9086143 the scrapbook industry has changed rapidly in the last five years
9086144 digital scrapbooking and photo books have become very popular ways to preserve your memories the majority of scrapbookers have digital cameras and for some of them it makes more sense to print a photo book rather than individual photos retailers in the traditional scrapbook industry have struggled to figure out how to capitalize on this trend the photobookbiz program is that answer to that question

9086150 41 stopped me in my tracks dropped my jaw opened up my eyes
9086151 41 was originally written by dave matthews as a reply to lawsuits brought forth by ross hoffman a former associate and manager of the band hoffman owned rights to a number of the bands songs in the early 1990s however due to creative differences he was eventually fired by the band and the bands present manager coran capshaw was hired as an owner to the bands songs hoffman felt he deserved a share of the profits which later caused a legal dispute between him and the band matthews wrote the song based upon the broken hearted feelings he was experiencing as he was going through legal disputes with a former mentor of his all of the loneliness that nobody notices now

9086153 it is a shame that in 84 years of philippine olympic participation not even one athlete was able to bring home a gold medal
9086154 the poor performance of our athletes in the olympics is not due to bad genetics but the states lack of concern for the development of a comprehensive program in the area of sports
9086155 i will be glad to answer all the questions thrown pscs way
9086156 there is no need to squabble or finger point now
9086157 the olympics are over and done with we need to move on but we have to learn from the mistakes weve committed
9086158 i have so much faith in michael keon and his gintong alay program
9086159 i received information the psc is keeping records of nsa performance including nsas which performed poorly not only in the olympics but in other competitions as well
9086160 these records would provide a jump off point for the merit based support system which we are trying to propose
9086161 the psc should re evaluate its spending while it could not limit its support to just a few a big concentration of its funding should be spent on sports associations with real chances of winning in the olympics
9086162 our demeaning olympics performance cant be excused just because we are a third world country kenya nigeria jamaica are not first world countries but got medals
9086163 the olympics are over and done with we need to move on but we have to learn from the mistakes weve committed
9086164 more than half of the 15 athletes we brought here broke national records

9086167 the shock waves of dramatically higher energy prices are reverberating through every corner of the u s and are likely to continue for the foreseeable future
9086168 there is a growing cry of hysteria tinged voices asking how we will survive in a world of high energy prices
9086169 a change such as this ultimately must lead to a change in the expectations of all consumers and producers this process takes time and involves several stages
9086170 the first stage is one of assuming the impact is a short run shock that will soon pass consumers make no or very minor temporary adjustments in spending habits and accept the fact the costs are higher and the money does not go as far producers accept smaller returns and margins but make no significant changes in the production process
9086171 at some point in time producers and consumers reach stage two where the change has not passed and it is no longer possible to avoid making more significant changes however in stage two neither consumers nor producers have fundamentally changed their lifestyles nor ways of doing business
9086172 stage three occurs when consumers and producers stop asking how they can continue with the status quo assuming the change is permanent and begin asking how we fundamentally change what and how we produce and consume
9086173 for the most part we are still asking how to keep doing what we have done rather than asking how we can use an entirely new approach to do things the process of long run adjustments to our economy does not begin until we change the long run expectations of consumers and producers these adjustments are not easy or quick
9086174 the process will be painful frightening and threatening for many people but like all changes will also offer a host of new opportunities previously unimagined by both producers and consumers

9086176 toyota doesnt have corporate convulsions and it never has it restructures a little bit every work shift
9086177 georgetowns paint shop is vast and crowded but in two places there are wide areas of open concrete floor each the size of a basketball court the story of how that floor space came to be cleared tons of equipment dismantled and removed is really the story of how toyota has reshaped the u s car market
9086178 its the story of toyotas genius an insatiable competitiveness that would seem un american were it not for all the americans making it happen toyotas competitiveness is quiet internal self critical it is rooted in an institutional obsession with improvement that toyota manages to instill in each one of its workers a pervasive lack of complacency with whatever was accomplished yesterday
9086179 the benefits ripple out not only does georgetown use less paint it also buys less cleaning solvent and has dramatically reduced disposal costs for both
9086180 the work is really threefold making cars making cars better and teaching everyone how to make cars better
9086181 that thinking is hardly novel lean manufacturing and continuous improvement have been around for more than a quarter century but the incessant almost mindless repetition of those phrases camouflages the real power behind the ideas continuous improvement is tectonic by constantly questioning how you do things by constantly tweaking you dont outflank your competition next quarter you outflank them next decade
9086182 james wiseman remembers the moment he realized that toyota wasnt just another workplace but a different way of thinking about work

9086186 processors have to incorporate sustainability practices into every decision they make
9086187 in a competitive market retailers and restaurateurs alike are looking for ways to differentiate their products in a positive way including through package labels and menu notes that boast ecologically conscious preparations with each customer asking for environmental data in a slightly different way environmental officers at meat processors find themselves customizing reports as fast as they can and hoping at some point for industry guidelines that will give them some standardized formatting still those who got out in front of the green bandwagon have a great story to tell major processors post corporate responsibility reports on their web sites with pride and position environmental stewardship awards in their electronic trophy cases they can connect with consumers in a positive way at a time when tainted meat recalls and downer dairy cows have put the industry on the defensive
9086188 responding to consumer demand reflected by the success of eco friendly retailers like whole foods and led by splashy embrace of the environment this year more mainstream grocers have been adding to the list of information they need to know about the sustainability practices of their meat suppliers at the same time foodservice demands that started in college campus cafeterias migrated as graduates took their taste for a healthy planet to their new neighborhoods and their restaurants
9086189 and as retailers and foodservice companies respond to these consumer concerns they are turning to their meat processor suppliers for answers and statistics they can use
9086190 smithfield foods vice president for environmental and corporate affairs dennis treacy says he fields corporate responsibility questions daily from smithfields 20 largest customers some of them conduct their own audits of smithfield plants for environmental sustainability practices
9086191 tyson recently published a new sustainability report in which it boasts having reduced water use by 15 percent per pound of finished product over the past two years
9086192 tyson foods chief environmental health and safety officer kevin igli has noticed customer inquiries becoming both more specific and more prolific while some companies will accept a copy of tysons sustainability report others want their own forms filled out the average survey used to take 15 to 20 minutes to complete igli says but a recent 41 question form took at least two hours

9086195 while customers figure out what they want meat processors continue to fill their arsenals of environmental goodwill with practices that save energy water waste and sometimes even cash though expensive capital investments often precede potential cost savings
9086196 cargill has 11 north american plants capturing methane gas for use as energy each required a 2 million investment and reduces fossil fuel demand by about 30 percent says spokesman mark klein noting the investment is typically recouped within a few years

9086201 supply chain design is too important to leave to chance
9086202 you need to hedge your system not just the price of your ag raw ingredient
9086203 it is futile to try to hedge systemic problems with just a single tool from a single domain you must go deeper than that you must look to simultaneously hedge several domains using multiple tools to develop a game changer that significantly reorders supply chain inputs to dramatically lower the cost of the finished ag raw ingredient while staying within natural systems logic
9086204 if you dont develop a game changer in line with natural systems logic you will continue to experience

9086210 as the economy slows best buy is encouraging its outlets to go off script
9086211 eastern european workers from cargo ships or oil tankers temporarily docked at baytowns busy port are spending their precious shore hours scouring the stores aisles they take a 15 minute cab or shuttle ride to stock up on ipods and apple aapl laptops priced cheaper than back home to speed their shopping the baytown best buy has moved the ipods from the back corner of the store to the front paired them with overseas power converters and simplified the signage since the changes were made over the holidays cash register receipts for the boat workers have ballooned by 67
9086212 but when multiplied by best buys more than 900 stores the retailer believes such bottom up insights could have an outsize impact on sales growth
9086213 local ingenuity and insight is contributing to a relatively rosy forecast from best buy considering so many consumers are on the ropes
9086214 shes shari ballard best buys executive vice president in charge of u s stores trying to give local managers more leeway to set sales strategies inventory levels and product mixes that may sound like retailing 101 give customers what they want
9086215 but it demands complex math from a big box retail chain built on standard operating procedures negotiated shelf space deals and headquarters generated planagrams
9086216 local store managers are even influencing best buys merchandising tactics
9086217 the chains shift in mindset requires a delicate balance adjustments spurred by local insight can boost sales but they also can add risk and expense to operations
9086218 some local novelties entail a lot less pressure after the chairman of a local retiree club called the golden boys bought a high def tv at the mooresville n c best buy store manager walt goney invited the clubs members to come by at 8 a m two hours before opening time eighty five members showed up for a hand holding session on switching to digital television they bought 350 000 worth of tvs and equipment that morning the cost to goney just 99 in labor plus coffee and doughnuts

9086220 corn plus is also driven to reduce its energy costs because of the potential for higher corn prices as fewer acres will be planted this spring compared with the previous year and a growing demand for the commodity in the united states and overseas
9086221 using this technology corn plus predicts it will result in a reduction in operating costs of up to 20 percent
9086222 with that in mind it wasnt surprising when in mid march corn plus hosted a three day pilot test on a distillers wet grains microwave drying process
9086223 in addition to reduced energy use and the resulting cost savings there are other advantages to using the microwave technology including reducing a plants water use in a typical corn based plant it takes 3 to 4 gallons of water to produce 1 gallon of ethanol with the cellencor microwave drying system the company estimates that it could retain 20 percent to 25 percent of the water used in the drying process

9086300 prohibitions on idolatry made up an important part of a developing repertoire of antitotalitarian politics
9086301 might be applied not only to the classical political ideologies but also to the more general phenomenon of the sacralization of politics or even to the recent identitarian movements which have acted so corrosively in so many ways
9086302 well honey thats wonderful youre growing up but why are you crying

9086311 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9086312 it is pretty audacious for the obama campaign to say that governor palin is not qualified to be vice president she has a record of accomplishment that senator obama simply cannot match governor palin has spent her time in office shaking up government in alaska and actually achieving results whether its taking on corruption passing ethics reform or stopping wasteful spending and the bridge to nowhere senator obama has spent his time in office running for president
9086313 i do believe that mccain has to do something to reshuffle the cards shake up the establishment do something unexpected and governor palin has all the kinds of things that mccain might see as a way to shake things up
9086314 now mondale tried to shake things up by going with geraldine ferraro she proved to be a disaster as a running mate and as a campaigner she was absolutely awful
9086315 it is fitting that this trust has been given to me eight eight years almost to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9086316 i think as well today of two other women who came before me in national elections i cant begin this great effort without honoring the achievements of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course senator hillary clinton who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign
9086317 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all

9086325 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
9086326 its a reversion to not just post colonial politics it is a seventh century way of doing politics
9086327 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
9086328 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake
9086329 e veryone in the world thought he had them wmds this was not some some cheney you know pipe dream

9086346 thats the america that george bush has left us and thats the future george excuse me john mccain will give us freudian slip
9086347 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
9086348 it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
9086349 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
9086350 the great state of alabama you have 60 votes how do you cast them

9086352 i have a unique perspective on this race for the future
9086353 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy michelle and i are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education and i will not settle for an america where some kids dont have that chance ill invest in early childhood education ill recruit an army of new teachers and pay them higher salaries and give them more support and in exchange ill ask for higher standards and more accountability and we will keep our promise to every young american if you commit to serving your community or your country we will make sure you can afford a college education now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable accessible health care for every single american if you have health care my plan will lower your premiums if you dont youll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves and as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave because nobody in america should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses and the time to protect social security for future generations and now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal days work because i want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons
9086354 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
9086355 barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power

9086389 we dont think the credit cycle has bottomed out yet
9086390 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses
9086391 based on this analysis we can say that there is a 94 percent probability of imminent global cooling and the beginning of the coming ice age
9086392 most of these major natural processes that we are witnessing now are interdependent and occur at the end of each interglacial period ultimately causing sudden long term cooling
9086393 stock up on fur coats and felt boots earth is now at the peak of one of its passing warm spells it started in the 17th century when there was no industrial influence on the climate to speak of and no such thing as the hothouse effect
9086394 carbon dioxide is not to blame for global climate change sorokhtin said
9086395 solar activity is many times more powerful than the energy produced by the whole of humankind mans influence on nature is a drop in the ocean
9086396 if we are facing a crisis at all i think it is that we are preparing for warming when it is looking like we are cooling we are preparing for the wrong thing
9086397 there is no evidence that carbon dioxide has ever driven or will ever drive world temperatures and climate change worrying about carbon dioxide is irrelevant

9086403 russia acted calmly wisely and beautifully this was a calm response peace has been established in the region and it will last
9086404 the chinese side was informed of the political and legal motives behind russias decision and expressed an understanding of them
9086405 china had expressed its understanding of russias decision to recognize georgias breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
9086406 unlike in comrade leonid brezhnevs time moscow is not trying to press any countries into supporting it on this issue if it did it could find quite a few sympathizers but who cares
9086407 population 485 sometimes the issue isnt whether you want the community to be
9086408 their objectives were not to assist developing countries but as promoted by the trilateral commission to curb world population with a view to serving us strategic and national security interests

9086480 yes it was my mistake and i take full responsibility
9086481 we want to play with the best and to do that we had to qualify for the group stage it was a big mental test the response was clear togetherness focus and efficiency the whole team was sharper and physically much better than on saturday and that is why it made it easier he cesc brings calm and confidence to the side and overall we had a good balance in the side cesc could have stayed on he always wants to play but he was probably more disappointed that they did not have a go at us
9086482 i have always said we have to be patient with him i felt he can be decisive in any game against anybody if we can get him in he has improved his first touch and his link up play which was vital for his progression but the way he finished his goal you cannot teach that he has that naturally

9086494 i cannot accept a tax on animals doing a natural thing
9086495 they have evolved over thousands of years burping and farting and to think we can change that in a short time is stupid several hundred years ago there would probably have been more animals than today
9086496 farmers do not think it will happen but once it is legislated the tax has to be paid and if you do not pay the ird will send you a penalty and another demand and then we are dealing with a faceless bureaucracy

9086506 its a little bit of a david goliath thing going on im going to play a role here carefully championing the north corridor and gathering some assistance from our colleagues and neighbors
9086507 in recent years many more americans have become aware of chinas growing global influence
9086508 the summer olympic games intensified this perception davidson has an exceptionally strong faculty in east asian studies and a healthy number of students who are interested in china and its relations with its neighbors this series allows us to examine issues that are important to the intellectual life of this community and to the life of the country as we prepare to elect a new president
9086509 my board wanted to make a statement that they didnt want to be hamstrung with an interlocal agreement so they kept it on the agenda and they voted it down
9086510 from my personal point of view it is valuable on behalf of all four towns that we work together
9086511 based on some of the comments that were made at last mondays town board meeting i have the sense that our board members are interested in working with the other towns on transportation issues but they would just prefer not to have the confines of an interlocal agreement
9086512 it seems best that we stay involved in an informal organization that focuses on key issues around us
9086513 in each case funding is going to always be a key issue especially when it comes to roads and transit
9086514 and how we can together create more leverage on these issues is really the heart and soul of this effort
9086515 i think weve got to pull our own nest together weve got to repair the issues that have erupted among ourselves and weve got to create a united front
9086516 does require a lot more work and it does create challenges going forward
9086517 at this point were just trying to figure out how we continue to do things together if were not willing to do things together

9086530 when you lose a game the solution is not always to buy did we play at our best i say no and so we have to look at why we had problems to win our first few games last year but we won them this year we did not win that is the reality we had 60 minutes to come back on fulham and we did not do it is that down to fulham s quality or the fact we were not good enough only the future will tell us that
9086531 of course we cannot afford to lose another game as players as a club playing for the title we dont want to lose a single game but we have lost the defeat is there we cannot change that we just have to keep on going try to be focused a little better and achieve things now the title becomes a bit difficult as we have lost the second game of the season i think losing here is going to be the best warning we can be given we cant think we are untouchable
9086532 monday round up senderos moves to milan arsene still not close to signing anyone
9086533 we dont have to be afraid of anyone i think weve seen in the last few seasons we can beat anybody so you have to be positive you have to believe that you can do it again at least make it to the final ive played a few finals now and you can see that anything can happen you can play well you can play not well you can win and lose certainly you have to make it there i think we have the quality and experience to do it and we are looking forward to it
9086534 i think one result and its called a crisis in a top four club that is what arsenal are they dont get beat very often so when they do the scrutiny is more on them i have seen them play in pre season and there has been some great football with arsenal i think because the way they play and the type of football they play they cannot be 100 per cent all the time on their day they are capable of taking apart anyone i always used to say dont judge over two games arsenal have quality in their side they have injured players to come back fabregas will make a big difference so crisis at arsenal no
9086535 it was our first game so they were very sharp and it took us by surprise i think it was very difficult to go there the fans were behind them and they treated it as their cup final they were very strong in their man for man marking we did not play our best but we got a good result hopefully well perform better at home the best thing is to think of it as 0 0 keep a clean sheet then we are through but this club needs to play champions league football
9086536 no we did nothing no strategy no banners nothing i insisted we do some but my bosses shot me down
9086537 xabi is my friend of course but apart from that he is a great player he has won the champions league and won a european championship and he is only 26
9086538 for me arsenal is arsenal and this club has something special that no others have we have to take care of it thats why you have to be intelligent in your decisions i have friends in spain and italy and they speak to me about other clubs and i know im privileged to be where i am and i dont want to lose it you see very few teams that play the way we do i enjoy the way we play i came here when i was 16 and i feel its my home

9086542 the us is the largest single emitter of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels
9086543 they had a corner and they took advantage from it that illustrates the first half we were not sharp enough we were not first enough on the ball the corner showed that and we were punished when you are focussed you can stop them scoring like that from the middle of the goal
9086544 after that we tried to come back in the second half but i feel we were too nervous in the last 25 minutes and wanted to create on our own rather than keeping our vision around the box that is we missed a lot today we lacked a bit more quality in our passing we you look at the possession we had and what we did with it that is always a sign it is only down power but vision and technical quality that was there today i dont know why you have to credit to fulham as well you need to keep a balance when i brought on bendtner we already had van persie nasri and adebayor you needed to win the ball back so you needed to keep three midfielders
9086545 it was the kind of game where you could not afford to make a mistake and we made a massive one it was a game where if you get to half time at 0 0 then you would win the game that is the biggest regret i have the result is there and we have to cope with it we have a big game on wednesday night and we have to respond with a top class performance because was we did today was just not good enough

9086575 this was a dramatic move and an investment in a more diverse economy tell me of another industry that can provide such a return in 2 months
9086576 after all what they support is the 30 million actual choices women have made since roe v wade to abort their children
9086577 this fertilized ovum known as a zygote is a large diploid cell that is the beginning or primordium of a human being
9086578 human development is a continuous process that begins when an oocyte ovum from a female is fertilized by a sperm spermatozoan from a male
9086579 gametes will unite at fertilization to initiate the embryonic development of a new individual
9086580 virtually every human embryologist and every major textbook of human embryology states that fertilization marks the beginning of the life of the new individual human being
9086581 from the moment when the sperm makes contact with the oocyte under conditions we have come to understand and describe as normal all subsequent development to birth of a living newborn is a fait accompli that is to say after that initial contact of spermatozoon and oocyte there is no subsequent moment or stage which is held in arbitration or abeyance by the mother or the embryo or fetus nor is a second contribution a signal or trigger needed from the male in order to continue and complete development to birth human development is a continuum in which so called stages overlap and blend one into another indeed all of life is contained within a time continuum thus the beginning of a new life is exacted by the beginning of fertilization the reproductive event which is the essence of life
9086582 by all criteria of modern molecular biology life is present from the moment of conception
9086583 it is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception
9086584 the basic fact is simple life begins not at birth but conception
9086585 if you would be so kind as to tell me where and how i can verify this fact i e life begins at conception i would be perfectly content vanquish all ambiguity on the abortion issue and join the pro life movement
9086586 youre entitled to your opinion that life begins at conception but one could just as easily argue that life begins before conception sperm and ovum must be alive in order for conception to take place
9086587 an assembly of molecules that function as a more or less stable whole and has the properties of life
9086588 why does it cost so much money to run for president
9086589 this point may certainly be extrapolated out to all activities of the church and of individual christians as a criteria for deciding what to put our energy and resources into those things that matter most to god
9086590 a leader who is ready to step in and be president
9086591 as long as bribes fraud and the like is not done lobbying can and should be done

9086600 what once looked like a walkover in the metro network sector has turned into a pitched battle to the surprise but not the delight of those who saw multiprotocol label switching mpls as the clear and obvious choice for metro transport
9086601 the carrier ethernet camp contends that mpls is too complex too expensive and too clunky for the metro environment
9086602 the datacom protocol stack of ip over ethernet was designed for asynchronous file transfer and ethernet as a local area network packet switching protocol and these traditional datacom protocols do a fine job for those applications i e for services that can tolerate uncertain delays jitter and throughput and or limited scope campus lan environments ip over ethernet was then assumed to become the basis protocol stack for ngns in the early 2000s due to the popularity of that basic datacom protocol stack for delivering the at that time prevailing services carried over internet which were mainly still file transfer based non real time applications

9086628 suponhamos que voc s ou a um grito de socorro de um homem em perigo provavelmente sentir dois desejos o de prestar socorro que deve ser o instinto greg rio e o de fugir do perigo que se deve ao instinto de auto preserva o mas voc encontrar dentro de si al m desses dois impulsos um terceiro elemento que lhe mandar seguir o impulso da ajuda e suprimir o impulso da fuga

9086693 i cant say why but this fact is simply obvious to me famous notable popular yes but not great in the fullest sense of the word
9086694 our cleaning lady comes on monday and for some reason that always fires me up to tidy the house

9086697 quem bater na minha namorada vai levar uma surra muito grande
9086698 you can spend all the money you want on an ehr but if you dont implement it fully or teach people how to use it fully thats the secret of the sauce right there you cant buy an ehr without spending a lot of money and time on implementation
9086699 it doesnt work by itself youve got to train people to use it and re engineer your processes and your work flow after you adopt it
9086700 we had no mechanism to improve quality we had a single record that may or may not have accurate info in it
9086701 our practice outperforms most practices on quality measures by at least 50 percent and we out earn most practices were in the top 5 percent of income for primary care

9086714 new place was still closed over a week after carol had tried to get into the place strange why open a new business and then not be there
9086715 its a mystery to me why the japanese police would target three relatively minor crewmembers
9086716 as captain all sea shepherd crewmembers act in accordance with my orders all activities opposing the illegal actions of the japanese whaling fleet are my responsibility yet no charges have been filed against me this is absurd and makes no sense at all
9086717 the arrest warrants against these three men will have absolutely no impact on the campaign
9086718 we will return to the southern ocean whale sanctuary and we will resume our campaign of intervention against the illegal activities of the japanese whaling fleet we will not be deterred we will not retreat and we will never surrender the lives of these defenseless whales to the outlaw whalers from japan
9086719 in december this ridiculous rhetoric will be set aside as we go head to head with the whale killers with new tactics new strategies and with two ships against the pirate whale killing fleet the whalers are getting desperate
9086720 the sea shepherd conservation society is not protesting whaling we are opposing illegal whaling in accordance with the principles of the united nation world charter for nature if our activities are illegal then the warrant would be addressed to me not to three non officer volunteers
9086721 we are the sea cops and our targets are criminals who illegally plunder the oceans of life in violation of international laws if the japanese police succeed in arresting any of these three men we will use the courts as a forum to focus international attention on japans continued illegal whaling activities
9086722 what we have here is a criminal operation receiving the support of the japanese government targeting conservationists attempting to oppose the unlawful slaughter of the whales all i can say to the japanese whalers is see you in december face to face in the southern ocean for a show down on the high seas once again we will be there

9086724 any extradition request received from a non treaty partner would be considered on a case by case basis
9086725 for a case to be considered the offence must be an offence in the uk
9086726 the convention for the suppression of unlawful acts of violence against the safety of maritime navigation
9086727 it clearly wants to persist with this programme and is seeking to deter other activists from disrupting its hunts
9086728 sticking interpol on the activists is unlikely to deter committed anti whaling campaigners
9086729 more than enough food is produced to feed a healthy global population distribution and access to food is a problem many are hungry while at the same time many overeat
9086730 we are providing food to take care of not only our necessary consumption but also our wasteful habits
9086731 as much as half of the water used to grow food globally may be lost or wasted
9086732 curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win win opportunities for farmers business ecosystems and the global hungry
9086733 an effective water saving strategy requires that minimizing food wastage is firmly placed on the political agenda
9086734 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion liters of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
9086735 unless we change our practices water will be a key constraint to food production in the future
9086736 people toss the food they buy and all the resources used to grow ship and produce the food along with it
9086737 improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food that is wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations
9086738 reaching the target we propose a 50 percent reduction of losses and wastage in the production and consumption chain is a necessary and achievable goal
9086739 saving water from field to fork curbing losses and wastage in the food chain
9086740 the improved understanding of trade and water management issues on local regional and global scales are of the highest relevance for the successful and sustainable use of water resources
9086741 then they dragged it to a closed tent and all the while they dragged it it was flapping its tail blowing out of its head and moving and trying to get away
9086742 it was so upsetting because euthanasia is meant to be an easy death and that whale did not have an easy death at all
9086743 that was the best way it could have been done
9086744 to an untrained person it might not look like the most fantastic thing but you cant get a better result than that
9086745 ik heb m ook nog even verteld dat hij wat deo moet gebruiken want hij stonk
9086746 you do not change things by fighting the existing reality to change things you must build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete

9086748 gee i wish there was an event coming up where i could reconnect with my fellow bulldogs and be a part of a very special cause
9086749 each edition includes 20 unique kits made up of dozens of patterns and samples
9086750 the love that is spoken of is not that which god expects
9086751 i do not want the death of the sinner but that he convert and live
9086752 god does not want sacrifice at all costs as if he took pleasure in seeing us suffer nor does he want sacrifices that are aimed at placing our rights and merits before him or that result from a misunderstanding of duty he wants rather the sacrifice that is required by his love and by the observance of the commandments sacrifice and mercy are both good things but they can become bad if misapplied they are good things if as christ did we choose sacrifice for ourselves and mercy for others they can become bad things if on the contrary we choose mercy for ourselves and sacrifice for others that is if we are indulgent with ourselves and rigorous with others ready to excuse ourselves and quick to judge others
9086753 man is in the image of god not one aspect of man we arent souls encased in a body we are people body and soul mans spiritual life is not something added to his physical life our very existence is our relationship to god
9086754 image of god so i prayed to the holy spirit for enlightenment my heart was flooded with thoughts first i remembered our blessed mother assumed
9086755 traditionally each month of the liturgical year is dedicated to some mystery of the faith or special saint
9086756 christ listen could not have died of some disease christ could not have died because of some mortal illness all illness disease the natural debilitating of the body is the result of sin let me emphasize this all our illness our disease our sickness our wasting away of our body for all of us this is our faith is the result of our sinful nature not so with christ that draining of the human body of his blood was the one way that christ sinless son of god and son of mary that he was the one way that he could die
9086757 is he saying that those that are ill or diseased are so because of some sin they committed
9086758 because an infinite being was offended by his creatures only an infinite being could provide adequate ransom to redeem
9086759 why does peter 1 peter 1 18 19 identify the blood of the lamb of god as
9086760 when priests are ordained we are told by the ordaining prelate to be what we are called to live up to what we offer to become like the one who ordains us the high priest jesus christ a priest is ordained not dear lord not for himself but for others he should spend himself
9086761 i will serve i will spend myself for others just as christ did
9086762 childhood is what you spend the rest of your life trying to overcome thats what momma always says she says that beginnings are scary endings are usually sad but its the middle that counts the most try to remember that when you find yourself at a new beginning just give hope a chance to float up and it will too
9086763 putting on the breastplate of faith and love and the helmet that is hope for salvation
9086764 it hope keeps man from discouragement it sustains him during times of abandonment it opens up his heart in expectation of eternal beatitude buoyed up by hope he is preserved from selfishness and led to the happiness that flows from charity
9086765 hope is the sure and steadfast anchor of the soul from hebrews that enters where jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf

9086776 si pu sapere cosa volete da noi veniamo forse noi da voi
9086777 e cosa centra anche se voi non venite in chiesa dio esiste sempre e vi aspetta
9086778 e una questione di secondaria importanza replic don camillo anche se voi siete stati scomunicati dio continua ad esistere e continua ad aspettarvi scuzate tanto io non sono iscritto al vostro partito non pratico la casa del popolo e sono considerato un nemico del vostro partito per questi fatti potrei forse asserire che stalin non esiste
9086779 non lo metto in dubbio e non lho mai messo in dubbio e se io ammetto che stalin esiste e mi aspetta perch tu non vuoi ammettere che dio esiste e ti aspetta non la stessa cosa
9086780 la sola differenza che mentre il vostro dio nessuno lo ha mai visto stalin lo si pu vedere e toccare e se anche io non lho visto e toccato si pu vedere e toccare quello che stalin ha creato il comunismo
9086781 e il mondo ne quale viviamo io te e stalin non forse una cosa che si vede e si tocca

9086787 i am so sick of not being able to do anything creative sick of it you hear
9086788 i always believed that no one has to teach a child to tell a lie
9086789 hald truth to simplify there schemes a lie is a lie and parents and children need to accept that fact children and adults tend to lie to cover up something to avoid something to protect someone or something and to fabricate the experiences we all remember the student in school who had the biggest tallest fastest strongest and most expensive toy or car money could by parents must teach their children that a lie is a deception and it is not acceptable we must teach them to tell the truth and live with the consequences or rewards i teach my daughters to women of integrity and honesty i also told them the worst thing they could do is lie and steal from me or anyone else as a society we must be honest with ourselves and past those values on to those around us believe that you can make the difference if everyone is lying then you be the one where truth resides be known for your positive words establish a legacy that no one can find fault with lying is wrong and we must be the change we expect others to see in our homes schools communities and government i want my daughters to see me as a man of truth honesty and integrity what they see will have a long term effect on their development and trust for men in the future learn to attack the problem not the person

9086858 theres not much of a difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage
9086859 the ideal situation is one in which there is one law and only one law for everybody
9086860 that principle is an important pillar of our social identity as a western liberal democracy
9086861 its a misunderstanding to suppose that that means people dont have other affiliations other loyalties which shape and dictate how they behave in society and the law needs to take some account of that
9086862 an approach to law which simply said there is one law for everybody and that is all there is to be said i think thats a bit of a danger

9086914 the city is on the one hand incomprehensible to its inhabitants as a whole it is inaccessible to the imagination unless it can be reduced and simplified but on the other hand any individual citizen by virtue of his particular choices of alternatives for action and experience will need a vocabulary to express what he imagines the entire city to be
9086915 clashing contradictions perhaps the central fascination of the city both real and fictional is that it embodies mans contradictory feelings pride love anxiety and hatred toward the civilization he has created and the culture to which he belongs

9086920 occasionally if he wanted to show proof of particular affection mr thundermug would sidle up to the teacher as they sat together on the sofa and stroke her hair with his long delicate fingers just as he used to groom and pick the lice out of his wifes coat this had startled miss young at first but he did it so rarely and with such wistful sincerity in his eyes that it always made her tremble with delight although she was careful to preserve the severe straight face which she had been taught to adopt at her teacher training college she was supposed to reciprocate by feeding him grapes or pieces of apple which she lowered gingerly between his open jaws or he would stretch out luxuriantly on the sofa while she stroked the warm tender skin of his chest which reminded her of chamois leather

9086989 science has no real agenda what i mean by this is that by its very nature science cannot be forced in any particular direction the necessarily open nature of science notwithstanding the secret work carried out in the cold war and in some commercial laboratories ensures that there can only ever be a democracy of intellect in this perhaps the most important of human activities what is encouraging about science is that it is not only powerful as a way of discovering things politically important things as well as intellectually stimulating things but it has now become important as metaphor to succeed to progress the world must be open endlessly modifiable unprejudiced science thus has a moral authority as well as an intellectual authority

9087132 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9087133 if youre guessing that it could be in the state of pennsylvania
9087134 im not going to tell you youre wrong but im not going to tell you anything else
9087135 i got one i got one when i got the save back in the day
9087136 it was a good one too it was extra cold it was freezing
9087137 i might just give it right back to him he deserves it more than i do
9087138 a lot of the credit goes to the guy over there
9087139 i ran over there once for the double play and i thought i had a chance to get him there
9087140 i just wanted to make sure it didnt go into the dugout
9087141 i went over there again on play and it took a nasty hop on him there right on the edge of the grass and hopped right on him and he stayed with it and made the play
9087142 it happened so fast i didnt feel him hit the bag
9087143 i just wanted to get over there and get the ball and call him out and he was out
9087144 hes a young man pitching in a pennant race against some pretty good hitters
9087145 this is a learning curve for him the more experience we can get him the better hell be as the season goes on
9087146 if coaches show confidence in you like that you have to give it back to them you have to go out there and succeed so he wants to use you again
9087147 today we battled a bit and walked a couple guys i just wanted to get in there and keep throwing strikes and make them make some plays i had a couple good ground balls and a couple close plays i thought it went well and hopefully i can go out back out there again and make it a little cleaner
9087148 theyve always got something in the pocket i have to keep my head on a swivel
9087149 the commissioners office has taken him off the field for now
9087150 i dont think so but like ive said we had an agreement and the terms were submitted in a timely manner thats the situation and our guys being brought into this and were just dealing with it
9087151 the guy youve got to feel for a little bit is the kid
9087152 hes put in the middle of something and all he really cares about in the end is playing baseball to not be able to do the thing that he wants to do is just frustrating
9087153 im not one of these fair weather fans said the history making politician during the interview days before accepting the democratic nomination thursday night
9087154 you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there
9087155 people arent watching the game its not serious white sox thats baseball southside
9087156 i just want to see him throw the ceremonial first pitch when hes the president
9087157 if that happens the chicago mayor would have a really good chance to have the summer olympics there in 2016
9087158 i guarantee you because that citys going to go crazy to the players it would be awesome to the fans but i dont know for me and cubs manager lou piniella it should be unbelievable
9087159 youre from chicago we root for you but we have spring training in phoenix so we have to be nice to john mccain too you never know i like the way obama talks i dont pay too much attention but itll be interesting
9087160 a lot of people will say if you go to vote for him all of the sudden youre a white sox fan some people out there are ignorant and say were not going to vote for him because hes a white sox fan that will happen i dont think he needs the white sox fans vote he just told the truth he likes the white sox hes always been a south sider and i guarantee you a few people here like him too like myself
9087161 giant suvs roam the streets with men in black with automatic weapons on the running boards
9087162 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9087163 we did want in september a veteran presence as a third catcher
9087164 we have two kids dusty brown and george kottaras in triple a but if youre looking for a third catcher thats probably not the ideal scenario when he became available it seemed to make sense for our organization
9087165 dramatically improved in his words thats good well see where that takes him hes got to start doing some strengthening some agility as the medical guys deem necessary but he does feel better he said its the first day he was able to get across the room without a lot of pain
9087166 i had that role when i was here so ive just got to back to my preparation for it
9087167 ive had pretty good triple a outings so ive just got to try and continue what i was doing down there and do it up here
9087168 weve spent a lot of time and energy to build him up to the capabilities of starting
9087169 the longer view of the 2008 season is that hes really made positive strides as a starter and were definitely planning to keep him on that track
9087170 twelve years ago i would have been hard pressed to understand why id want to be involved sexually with one person this long
9087171 before tea the longest my intense sexual interest would last would be maybe two years but the real rewards of a relationship come after youve been together a while thats where tea and i are lucky
9087172 theres nothing wrong with acknowledging the panoply of lifes rich experience you cant control your mind why would you want to you cant feel guilty about being alive about being a man about feeling attracted you can only control your actions
9087173 he put me on some crazy romanian horses ive done a little riding and i knew the second i got on that animal that it did not know what it was supposed to do
9087174 they horses all ran off in different directions and went berserk every time theyd clap the clapperboard to start a scene my horse ran right into a tree and threw me in a water tank
9087175 i had a catheter in my arm because i was sick from eating the food over there
9087176 i dont even know what his movies are about and why he keeps the same theme of people in the jungle and the vampires who ride in from space sic what are you doing uwe bloodrayne was an abomination its a horrifying and preposterous movie
9087177 uwe was fun if he called me tomorrow and wanted me to be in a movie i would do it

9087187 i wont try to but id like to whatever happens happens
9087188 its tough when youre used to playing every day but it was out of my hands
9087189 we want to make sure that injury is behind him
9087190 we want to get to the point where he feels good about it and we feel good about it
9087191 hopefully by the end of the month ill be playing a little more kellys doing a great job right now and he deserves to play
9087192 to the point where we want to get a look at him up here
9087193 you might see the biggest comeback in history who knows
9087194 even when im activated and they want me in a game theyre going to be careful
9087195 like white sox pitching coach don cooper and i were talking the other day in baltimore when we had a huge lead i might come in and pitch the ninth inning something like that first time out if we have that luxury
9087196 certainly the teams situation is more important than any of my work and this isnt really the place to rehab but if they see i have good enough stuff in these simulated games and get out there in a non pressure situation and able to get through it all right we can start working my way back into that role i was in i dont know if ill be in the eighth inning but at least being in a spot to contribute to a team
9087197 probably for a bullpen setting this is about the most intensity youre going to get
9087198 you have to add on the final finish when youre out there and get the game adrenaline going
9087199 thats what im curious to see and a simulated game might be more intensity just with seeing hitters there and make your pitches and make your game type situations im curious to see after that how it reacts that will be a telltale sign
9087200 we have to get him back in action first see how hes doing im not thinking about that right now maybe someone else is but im not
9087201 then everything ended up working out after the game as i had hoped
9087202 and they told me i was coming up here to new york to yankee stadium that was a pretty special moment
9087203 i tried to get a haircut this morning before i got to the ballpark
9087204 but the more we talked about it the last few days we just said you know what
9087205 he has been a kid thats pretty much mature beyond his years
9087206 so we dont think coming up here right now would phase him
9087207 but its one of those things that you can only hope and imagine and you cant get caught up worrying about it good things happen and luckily things happened the way i couldve wished for
9087208 i dont think you ever take a high school kid and think hes going to be here at 20 years old
9087209 i thought i was going to be supporting john mccain now im sure of it
9087210 with the release of the new platform the emancipation of women may once again become a legitimate political position
9087211 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
9087212 its never been as explicitly stated that the democratic party supports a womans decision to have their child and offers her practical support to have her child its an historic step forward

9087223 the future of a community a people a church and a nation depends on the children who will inherit it
9087224 if we prevent our children from being born we remove ourselves from the future its really that simple no children no future
9087225 heres the second truth killing an unborn child is never the right answer to a womans or societys problems acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that bind us all into one human family

9087244 we got a kick out of the fact that he swiped his corporate credit card to put up the five hundred
9087245 everyone talks about dawn ward but ashley does ten times more than me he really is the brains behind everything
9087246 it really is a family business and he can be sat working in the office ten hours a day
9087247 we buy land build houses and finish it right to the end so clients can literally just open the door and its ready to move straight in
9087248 but its all about individuality no two houses we do are the same the people we are selling to want quality things that are different they see a lot of nice things and go to a lot of nice places thats why we go to all the trade shows to find out whats hot in milan paris las vegas and dubai
9087249 we bought a derelict barn for ourselves over 10 years ago we got quotes to convert it into a house and it was just too expensive so we did it ourselves i was very heavily pregnant at the time but we both managed it sold the house and doubled our money we really enjoyed it and wanted to do another one i bought some sites and renovated them selling one house to kevin campbell of everton and one to david thompson from blackburn rovers they were delighted and word just spread
9087250 i just buy houses and sell them i just happen to know a lot of people in football they would only buy them from me if the design was good with wayne and coleens house for instance coleen is a very good friend of mine and while i get given all the credit she had a huge input and has fantastic taste
9087251 but we have finished my youngest daughter charlies bedroom its fantastic based on a castle theme with 9 500 swarovski crystals stuck on the ceiling by hand
9087252 im going to new york next week to look round the delis out there including the sex and the city and when harry met sally featured ones i want to bring the new york style and fairy cakes to the area
9087253 i was encouraged by friends to do cooking professionally and if youre going to do it to a high standard alderley edge is the place to be
9087254 i am going to offer fresh nutritious goods giving customers the opportunity to buy meats hams and olives for parties there will also be a small selection of italian and french wines to serve with them i come from a classical music background not pop music and there will be an ambient atmosphere with low key jazz in the shop
9087255 there are 14 premises the length of london road and obviously restaurants play music a lot later than i will 7pm
9087256 we decided to wait until we got back as we wanted to open them ourselves it was quite tense with everyone else knowing their results
9087257 the best thing is doing as well as your twin we have never been very jealous of each other but getting the same results is really good
9087258 weve always been quite close i think most twins are although we do have our own personalities so it would have been quite worrying if one did better than the other as we both worked equally hard and helped each other it really helped when revising i dont think i would have got the results i had if gavin didnt help me
9087259 were very fortunate at the high school to teach some extremely talented young people but a double success like this is unusual even by our standards its amazing for them to get 21 a between them its incredible i taught them back in year seven when they were 11 years old and it was obvious then they were going to do well
9087260 ive done work experience with george osborne and would like to study politics gavin is keen on languages and would like to work for the foreign office
9087261 it doesnt feel real yet everything went to plan but after the success of the team i felt it might be too much to ask
9087262 i couldnt expect anything more its a dream scenario i feel like part of the team because you have to have a medal these days
9087263 i feel like a completely different athlete from athens i enjoy it a lot more and am lucky to have people around me to help me improve
9087264 our centres have never been so crowded its heartbreaking to see so many animals without a permanent home for months
9087265 we have cats to suit every personality and household and hope there may be people out there willing to give these cats a second chance of happiness
9087266 i would advise anyone thinking about taking on a pet to come and visit us
9087267 the sanctuary is home to a variety of different animals as far as cats are concerned the cat barn has facilities for 29 cats on a short stay basis
9087268 these come to us as abandoned pets or are brought in by the public injured and or lost
9087269 we always try to find their owner but often their owners dont want to be traced
9087270 fortunately there is a lot of interest for pet cats from local people and we rehome them on a regular basis pet idol winner wendy millward got her cat jack from us most days someone will be at the sanctuary looking for a new pet
9087271 but in recent weeks some people have been sneaking up to the sanctuary late at night and dumping their unwanted pets at the gate
9087272 during the last few days our numbers have grown to 36 cats
9087273 the current high standards of animal welfare by which we operate cant be compromised and if we are full then were full however we cant exactly say that to a cat in a cardboard box at the gate
9087274 there are so many other animals needing help such as rabbits ferrets guinea pigs as well as horses and bigger animals and you would be making a really positive difference to their lives
9087275 i have heard the directors under the three strategic directors in the new authority will each be paid around 90 000 a year
9087276 we are starting at the top of the management structure and working our way down so we dont know at this stage exactly how many directors there will be under the strategic directors
9087277 the strategic directors will certainly want to give their input into the next tier of management as will the chief executive
9087278 once those posts are filled they will look at the next level there will be something like ten directors but we have no idea what salaries each will receive at this stage
9087279 the biggest problem has been over planning permission it has taken nearly two years to get planning macclesfield borough council has cost us a fortune
9087280 it has taken an unreasonable amount of time in reality even six months ago or a year ago the project would have been underway by now
9087281 no company can afford that sort of delay costs keep going up because of the delay it is 12m now with interest and that means at the end of the day we need to be selling the offices for more and that may not be possible in this climate
9087282 so it is fair to say that we are a bit fed up with mbc
9087283 its not going ahead in the short term its still a good development site but there are not an awful lot of occupiers out there we did not feel confident starting the development
9087284 the application was submitted in may 2007 and planning permission was granted in august 2007 that is normal procedure
9087285 it was approved in february 2008 but then needed a legal agreement because there were highways works which is standard when involving a multi million pound project
9087286 they could have started the scheme the site was sold with planning permission two years ago they decided to change it
9087287 my mum and dad took me to see the victory parade in 1999 and i was too young to understand can you tell me what has changed from 1999 to 2008
9087288 we are being punished for the minority of scottish fans that were invited into manchester to drink at their leisure on the streets
9087289 its everything we need to sharpen our game for the following weeks first league game against new brighton
9087290 pre season training has gone well and were building nicely towards our opening game against new brighton
9087291 weve had a good influx of new players with danny jones from new brighton matt langtree from stockport and ryan parkinson from manchester coming in
9087292 a few guys have also come back to us after finishing university so competition for team spots is quite fierce and that has been reflected in the intensity shown at training
9087293 were not looking to make up the numbers in this league i think weve got a very good crop of players probably the strongest and most talented bunch weve had since i joined the club so weve got to make sure we do ourselves justice and have a go at winning the league
9087294 everyone is excited about this season and we cant wait to kick it off
9087295 borough councillors have had a great deal of contact with highways over the past year to attempt to resolve the many parking problems in our prosperous town
9087296 our last major meeting was in late june when we pressed for an early exhibition date and we are very pleased to have achieved a september date
9087297 we continue to welcome contact from businesses that is best channelled via the wilmslow business group and from residents that is best channelled via noparking com
9087298 collectively we will all have the details in early september from the advance publicity campaign promised by highways we urge everybody to take advantage of this one opportunity to influence the future of on street parking provision in wilmslow by making their views known at the exhibition
9087299 they are different and very lifelike except they are in silver
9087300 but we are into quirky that is the nature of our business we have handmade lines which are fabulous and will look great on our new mannequins
9087301 it has opened up a whole new life for me
9087302 i doubt if there are many 88 year olds who can use a computer like my grandmother she is quite amazing
9087303 i wanted to raise money for them by sky diving but my doctor wouldnt hear of it
9087304 and they taught me how to use the computer properly so they are really important to me
9087305 so we went next door to number 11 and i met gordon brown instead

9087308 but in those days you can see how much effort they put into the event just by looking at the photographs
9087309 we think it would be lovely to bring this event and more back into the village
9087310 i went to visit my uncle who is 102 in pembrokeshire and they were holding a rose queen fete at the time and it was just so lovely everyone was there the whole community turned out and i just thought how nice it would be if we could do the same in alderley edge

9087313 nothing about the projects execution inspires the feeling that this was ever intended as anything more than a lark which would be fine if it were a good one as it is audience teeth grinding sets in early and never lets up

9087316 its important for him to pitch before the season ends he doesnt care what role that is he just wants to pitch as much as he can before the season ends so that hes comfortable going into spring training so we have talked about starting and relieving hes not against either one
9087317 and i dont need a hitter standing there to tell me
9087318 when it comes time well sit down and talk about it im not going to make the decision if im a starter or a reliever i dont want to be the one to make that decision its not about me

9087320 genealogy is the third most popular pursuit behind the twin vices of gambling and porn
9087321 i knew as i closed the final page that this was the film i had been looking to direct
9087322 the story spoke to me on so many levels both personal and artistic
9087323 the women in johns early life truly shaped who he became and the strengths and weaknesses of their relationships are central to this film
9087324 a lot of times umpires just cant turn around and get out there quick enough
9087325 it could become a slippery slope issue where we start out with fair or foul and before you know it were reviewing a lot of things
9087326 weighing a few calls here or there that could be critical against the backdrop of playing really long games when there seems to be a parallel effort to try to move the pace of the game along i just think this is an issue that could create other issues along the way hopefully the people who voted in favor will end up being correct
9087327 but i hope i dont have to use it tonight
9087328 our main concerns are with places like houston with the line or places where maybe you have an interference call with a fan being able to touch the ball
9087329 with the technology i kind of saw it coming for those kinds of calls
9087330 i hope it doesnt come to any more than that with the way ballparks are being built it is very tough to put yourself in the position to see something 350 feet away and with the green monster in boston youd have to be a giraffe
9087331 i think with the pressures of other sports having replay the outcry from the public you look at polls its 3 1 people think replay needs to come in
9087332 i think with all that being said the pressures of that mounted to where they needed to put replay in a process it was fought off for three or four years but now its been introduced
9087333 it used to be a lot easier to see the ball go out because you had these cookie cutter baseball stadiums
9087334 now you have all these new stadiums with all these railings and the balls can hit so many different things
9087335 it might not happen once a game and it could happen what three times this year it would only take a few minutes anyway
9087336 baseball is a game of human error umpires miss calls players make errors thats baseball i dont want instant replay for balls and strikes or anything like that but i think for home runs its important
9087337 its just a waiting game right now whatever we do in the future is gonna have to be fresh
9087338 i have to see if the band as a whole wants to go into the recording studio for a new record
9087339 that makes sense on some level for us theres gotta be an angle it cant be just playing our old songs over and over
9087340 were working on new stuff and were gonna have a couple of weeks off and then in about two weeks time were back out to italy to start writing again
9087341 weve already done a few tracks and it sounds great so were just working to the future
9087342 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
9087343 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9087344 nothings holding me back strength wise ive got one more test tomorrow and i think that hopefully will be the last one before i can get in a game
9087345 were going to see how he does tomorrow facing the hitters
9087346 the one thing that weve done is we have not rushed this and we have not tried to get ahead of ourselves we wont do that after tomorrows performance well make an evaluation to see if the next step is that he needs more time or we can activate him
9087347 we couldnt necessarily bring him back as a starter if we activated him right away just because hes not built up
9087348 i would have loved to have him back three weeks ago but thats not the case we had to deal with an injury and hes been feeling pretty good we all feel good about that well make a decision sometime this weekend
9087349 its hard not being in battle with these guys every day
9087350 you spend so much time being with them to get where you want to be its frustrating not being out there fighting and battling im trying to get better and get back with them
9087351 he will rejoin the team and we talked about maybe an instruction league and everything but its been decided that hed like to work with pitching coach chuck hernandez which were all for
9087352 theres some open mindedness as far as possibly pitching winter ball somewhere thats not anything etched in stone thats just dontrelle open minded to it but that part hasnt been solidified in any way shape or form
9087353 actually just having good workouts every day is a priority for me
9087354 if you win those battles then hopefully i can get to that point good starts are not really a concern of mine i just want to throw well every time i get on the mound and stay consistent
9087355 it was my bicep there was some cramping and stuff like that but im fine now
9087356 my knee feels great my knee feels really good other than that just the confidence to be able to do those things and the workouts i feel a lot better
9087357 people keep talking about the investment we have in him thats not the issue with the detroit tigers the issue of the detroit tigers is we think dontrelle willis is a heck of a pitcher and has struggled and has a chance to be a heck of a pitcher again
9087358 we think we got a heck of a potential pitcher on our hands this isnt a guy who hasnt done anything this guys done something were trying to get dontrelle prepared to be a successful pitcher in 2009 is that gonna happen i cant answer that question
9087359 but were not gonna do anything to force that issue were gonna make suggestions and when push comes to shove itll be dontrelles decision
9087360 thats the thing i dont have any playing time this year and i dont want to come back next year and do the same thing
9087361 i have my career and i want to move on
9087362 i dont want to be the way i am this year i want to go somewhere and play more
9087363 i wanted to get something off my chest because it bothered me a lot and i needed to say it
9087364 he didnt say it to me but thats what it looked like
9087365 my office door has been open all season long on the road and at home
9087366 ive had specific conversations with miguel and explained some things to him obviously not to his satisfaction whats out there is out there i really dont want to keep it going
9087367 i dont have any doubts in my mind that its the right decision may there be some little kinks in it early on possibly to me i think its the right decision and im actually all in favor of it it may take a little bit longer in the beginning than we want but im sure it will get ironed out eventually it will go really quickly
9087368 its not like its something theyve got to go back and forth like the nfl did he get his toes in did he have control of the ball all that stuff thats not whats happening i dont think it will be used that often and i dont think it will be that big of a distraction
9087369 i really believe that because of the replay its going to be right
9087370 there probably wouldnt be any sense in arguing it anyway i just still wish i had a red flag
9087371 there is only one of these events in the olympics and its the hardest of the three because its a very physical and mental event it carries the most prestige if it was a different event it wouldnt be quite as special you only have one chance to get this right and if you make the wrong decision its all over you can lose it on a simple tactical error however i go in as reigning world champion and i am going into a competition knowing i have beaten everybody else
9087372 he is my hero and ive dreamt about an olympic final with him and im going to do my best to try and get there and if hes in the final with me god help him in the dream i knock him out its obviously a big step up from the youth olympics but a lot of things have happened i became world junior champion european champion and those things gave me a lot of confidence
9087373 i thought your readers might want to know about this
9087374 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields
9087375 the fact that people calling themselves conservatives not only write this kind of
9087376 just this afternoon i thought that maybe i should start working on writing out the
9087377 they werent too busy today could you come to my house and empty my green wheelie bin
9087378 the binmen put a sticker on it saying that there was too much soil inside for them to take it its a garden waste bin so youre always going to get a bit of soil in it they come every two weeks to empty the green bins and because of the local government strikes it hadnt been collected the previous fortnight i just think that they wanted to finish quickly and go home perhaps they get a bonus for being faster
9087379 i went to find out my local councillors contact details and then saw all of the councillors email addresses and i thought why dont i let them all know what i think
9087380 if you were my customer and you received poor service it would be up to me to try and make it up but for them they just have a monopoly i would stop paying my council tax if i wouldnt get arrested
9087381 we responded to the email very promptly and forwarded it on to the necessary departments im not saying the council doent get things wrong but in this case it would appear that the men were following the correct procedures if everybody put lots of soil in the bins then they wouldnt be able to collect them
9087382 we had to spend a considerable amount of time on this situation
9087383 it looked like there were only two people that believed i was trying to hit a rod the umpire and the guy that worked for the commissioner i didnt try to hit anybody but they found me with that and theres nothing i can do
9087384 the way im looking at it is although we dont agree with it we dont think he was intentionally throwing at anybody we have to accept it and move on and prepare accordingly what this allows him to do now is to take some time to adequately prepare himself to make his next start which will be a week from tomorrow i think hell be a full go at that particular point in time
9087385 you can pitch with some pain and this one isnt a big thing its just a little bit of pain ive been having a problem with my back but its nothing out of control
9087386 they pay me to pitch when i dont pitch im not going to say i dont get paid but thats not why im here its something where i cant help people now ive got to deal with that
9087387 i was supposed to pitch tomorrow i talked to dave and i think the best thing is to do it now so thats why the suspension is starting today once the six games are done ill be ready to pitch
9087388 he bakes all my cakes and i add my buttercream and decoration
9087389 i went to new york ten years ago to see friends and saw the shop and thought it looked great i was offered an apprenticeship and was there for three years
9087390 nothing i have seen here has been decorated quite the way i do it a few people do party or wedding cakes but not cup cakes and for the last eight months ive been slowly establishing myself in the farm shop at horseshoe farm
9087391 the award is recognition of what we do it really does feel as if ive won an oscar
9087392 i thought i would put a cake in and hoped to get a bit of publicity so i was very pleased to have it confirmed that my cake tasted so good im very pleased with my award it was a surprise
9087393 i dont know if hes going to be ready to pitch the next couple of days or not i hope he is and i hope he can get a little work in at tacoma too
9087394 it is non profitmaking and brings the whole community together to raise money for good causes
9087395 there was a brilliant carnival spirit last year so lets hope the sun is shining and everyone turns out
9087396 were starting to receive more calls from people across the macclesfield borough who are worried about how they are going to pay their bills this winter and what expenses they are going to cut to stay in budget for some it may even be a decision whether to heat or eat
9087397 decisive action is needed as price hikes are pushing more older people to the point where they are really struggling to pay their energy bills age concern nationally is renewing our call for the prime minister to hold an urgent summit at downing street to look at long term solutions to address how the government can get its fuel poverty strategy back on track
9087398 its expensive to keep a pet what with the vets bills and the prices of cat and dog food in the supermarket have gone up we had three cats abandoned on our doorstep over the weekend and as the cost of living soars we think it will get worse theres no question the rise in the number of animals we are dealing with is down to the credit crunch the situation is in crisis
9087399 the rising cost of utilities food and fuel is definitely affecting us
9087400 we collect animals from quite a distance about a 30 mile radius in some cases and that takes a lot of petrol where possible we do ask people to help by dropping the animals in to us but thats not always possible so were now having to be mindful of these spiralling costs and where possible try and plot the shortest routes but we cant not go out in the car it is also costing much more to use the incubators heat lamps and other vital equipment to nurse the animals back to health due to the rise in energy bills even corn for the water birds which is something we used to take for granted has gone up three or four times it is all diverting precious money that should be going in to the care of the animals
9087401 he had a fairly heroic time and sustained very severe injuries
9087402 following one episode in battle where he was blown up he was injured to the extent that a priest was sent to perform the last rites he was subsequently promoted
9087403 we found a slipper at the back of the house leading out into farmland and we decided an air search was needed
9087404 he was obviously not dressed for the weather it was a bitterly cold night and he was old
9087405 we found mr garton in a ditch that was filled with water it was about four to five feet deep with more than two to three feet of water there was a scrape mark on the bank he was wearing pyjamas and had a bramble branch in one hand
9087406 i have known mike a long time about 50 years he was a genuinely nice man who was always smiling and had time for everyone
9087407 mike was a dear friend of mine he and i spent many happy hours together particularly over a pint of bitter he was a wonderful character and one of lifes true gentlemen
9087408 i have only known mike a relatively short time about six or seven years we used to go to the ship inn in styal together about once a week its going to seem strange him not coming in any more he was a very nice fellow he struck me as being trustworthy honest a very friendly and affable man and a good all round chap
9087409 mike was a great man very inspirational jovial and full of good cheer he will be missed by an awful lot of people in styal
9087410 for every shop which becomes vacant there are lots more ready to come in to wilmslow
9087411 if a shop comes up for rent it gets taken up straight away and there are lots of independent retailers doing very well thank you
9087412 i am passionate about wilmslow its a nice place to work and shop its got a great community spirit if you can be bothered to get involved with it there is certainly a great rapport between traders who all help each other and we have lots of loyal customers who like to shop here in wilmslow individual traders can offer a lot more than the multi nationals for instance here at xpose we stock a lot of quirky labels and hand made garments from small designers which cant be bought in other shopping centres and there is something new in every week unlike at the big stores where there is just one delivery a season
9087413 customers enjoy coming in to wilmslow to shop and maybe have a coffee afterwards thats why we feel that current restrictions on parking are too tight and should be extended to two hours
9087414 we at wbg are not just a networking group but continue to campaign for the development and look of wilmslow we have had several meeting with mp george osborne who is going to help us set up meetings with relevant parties to highlight the tired look of many aspects of wilmslow wilmslow can be the jewel in the crown of cheshire as it is known throughout the country and boxes far above its weight however it is easy to criticise the town without putting in the effort to change the things that need changing and i would urge any business whether multi national sole trader or organisations to join with us as we do our best to improve the overall look and and therefore the the shopping experience that customers have when they come to cheshires nearly finest wilmslow
9087415 as well as continuing to enjoy notable success from long running bestselling titles such as the kite runner we are also well positioned with strong publishing lists for the second half and beyond
9087416 we are now seeing the benefits of our focused strategy which is positioning us well for the rest of the financial year and the longer term
9087417 my coach did give me permission to go to a foo fighters concert at wembley last month they are my favourite band but i had to promise not to dance
9087418 as a teenager i just cycled to keep fit and messed about with my brother it didnt cross my mind that i might become an elite athlete but my dad who is a keen amateur cyclist and former national champion spotted my potential
9087419 i had to move house to be able to store all my sports kit im sponsored by adidas so i have more trainers than ill ever need
9087420 its amazing but we just hope people are able to understand that we cant always be good
9087421 it keeps me on course to realise my olympic ambition
9087422 i am very much looking forward to coming and serving at st chads as minister
9087423 one of the highlights of being a vicar is seeing people discover the love of god for themselves and the joy it brings them as they learn to walk with him i also love to see people discover and fall in love with gods word and see his spirit work in their lives lowlights in ministry are times when people seem to fall away from faith and stop walking with christ
9087424 idol 2008 is the music and dance competition for singers vocal groups dancers and dance groups to enter the competition is the second biggest in the country after the x factor and im really looking forward to the next stage i am a very good singer
9087425 i cant see this proposal working its a good idea in theory because it would help to deter young litter bugs and make them realise that its not right to drop litter in the streets but i just cant imagine how its going to be policed
9087426 i fear a ten year old is going to get a whack around the ear because they are costing their parents more money and they are not always that understanding in some of the families we deal with
9087427 it would be down to the parent and unfortunately we dont know what they are doing when they are out of our sight
9087428 i know it is wrong and i have known for ages
9087429 i was certainly taught that littering was the wrong thing to do before the age of ten and we need to get to all members of the community
9087430 around schools particularly at lunchtimes there are littering hotspots around shopping parades for example
9087431 we have very clean and tidy streets but they could be cleaner and tidier
9087432 my observation is that youngsters are some of the biggest perpetrators of littering
9087433 it is about discipline from ten years old they know what they are doing is wrong
9087434 what happens if they do not pay do we really want to start criminalising children and their parents because a child drops litter
9087435 many families may not be able to afford to pay
9087436 im absolutely cock a hoop for 34 years i slogged away on that bypass and got it to the top of the councils list twice it will be more than rewarding to see the first sod turned
9087437 were there and its fabulous when i was elected in 2001 the bypass was my main priority and im thrilled to bits were ready to go
9087438 they are putting in a junction that doesnt exist which will cause delays
9087439 this is fantastic news things have changed because people realised that this is a vital access road to the airport and a strategic road linking the m6 and the m60
9087440 george osborne has been pitching with ruth kelly former transport minister and parish councillor nigel schofield has put a lot of work in with the north west development agency but overall it has been a combined effort from lots of people
9087441 we are committed to investing in local transport this bypass will really improve the environment in alderley edge and nether alderley while cutting congestion reducing delays and improving access for communities and businesses
9087442 the road will also improve the reliability of local bus services as well as access to manchester airport and the alderley park regional employment site which will help facilitate expansion and job creation
9087443 i think it will give us the opportunity to get the village back to a village feel
9087444 i hope the high street returns to the old high street we used to have
9087445 this is marvellous news and means that we can begin environmental works on the route next month
9087446 we will contact residents and parish councillors to keep them informed of developments and are hopeful that main construction road works will start on site in january 2009 and will be completed approximately two years later
9087447 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
9087448 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me
9087449 samantha has not and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful
9087450 i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction
9087451 i was angry when i first read his attack on me but for me i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him
9087452 i am not standing in his way i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is
9087453 ive got other responsibilities the children a home life and an elderly dad who needs me and ive recognised that i cant have it all
9087454 after all those years of getting up at 04 00 we can understand why she wants a change
9087455 her honesty and openness have helped make gmtv the success it is
9087456 alc201 best practices for rules based alcohol consumption at the microsoft teched 2008 new zealand conference event
9087457 how has this half a pint of lukewarm lion red changed your perception of microsoft
9087458 do i think its a mans world in television that is the most ridiculous question i have been asked all week
9087459 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male if any middle class white male i come across says he wants to enter television i say give up all hope theyve no chance
9087460 he lists women because he couldnt possibly name all the men in positions of power in tv because he would be there all bloody day
9087461 do you really think nuns are all wizened funereal old ladies today its not like that any more thanks to an injection of youth and vitality brought to our country by foreign girls
9087462 nuns are women above all else and beauty is a gift from god
9087463 im getting sick and tired of telling you to shake that thing
9087464 a band from berlin that made one of the best rock albums on the legendary green brain 1 000 series
9087465 a fabulous and wholly underrated krautrock treasure lavas low down gritty and acidic musical thrust actually owes a great deal more to a dusted sounding dimension of uk psych that extends between the first hawkwind album and say sam gopal than any of what their german contemporaries were getting up to at the time the heavy wrung out vibes on this onell really creep up and bite you on the ass if you give it a chance
9087466 the last four or five records we did were just so compromised by that major label situation but thats the way it goes
9087467 some smart bleak songs in the vein of nick cave and calexico
9087468 all school buildings and the district made adequate yearly progress
9087469 all schools will be taken off the ayp academic warning list which is huge
9087470 it encompasses the district and is aligning our arrows all on one target so we are on the same page
9087471 when he was terminated his computer was seized and locked up so the information was protected
9087472 i will take his or her punishment put me in their place
9087473 in a very unconscious way brought dignity to poverty ridden life and love of nature
9087474 books have been the best companions of my entire life
9087475 acquiring knowledge by reading these and other books is crucial for our intellectual evolution
9087476 reading books brings joy and a sense of accomplishment reading books like the ones listed make us understand the issues things people planet and the universe better and propel us to the heights unknown by doing so it make this planet a better place to live get along and flourish
9087477 an essay on the principle of population or a view of its past and present effects on human happiness with an inquiry into our prospects respecting the future removal of mitigation of the evils which it occasions
9087478 charlatan americas most dangerous huckster the man who pursued him and the age of flimflam
9087479 i got the tractor and finally i got a copy of the magazine too
9087480 lets see i got four john deeres two allis chalmers a centaur thats my boys and a gibson ive also got two mead mighty mouses small crawlers that they used to make in chicago up until about the early 60s
9087481 you know its always something they need but i kind of like them
9087482 anything old i like ive got corn shellers grinders burr mills all kinds of farm related stuff
9087483 i help a fellow on a farm over at odell hes got all the new big equipment that i was never around before so im still learning
9087484 i wanted to buy one so i got on the internet and looked at a couple of tractor web sites i found a guy selling one in pennsylvania it was a young fellow selling it for his mother it had been his fathers and he had passed away he had bought it new and restored it in 1985
9087485 now when he restored it he sent a picture of it in to green magazine thats the john deere enthusiasts magazine and they put it on the cover
9087486 my wife got on the internet and tried for about six months but we never did find a copy we could buy
9087487 i was up north of seneca at a sale for a guy who had died who collected international tractors he happened to have a whole hayrack full of books and magazines and thats where i finally found that one i wanted
9087488 its just a bug that gets in you one of these old tractors is just something that makes your heart race a little bit when you can get them running
9087489 tanner always had that glow behind him it drew people to him
9087490 he had his little charms his little quirks and expressions
9087491 he had a little bit of a lisp and sometimes wed give him a hard time yet hed crack back pretty fast
9087492 he didnt have any complaints and he could make friends at the drop of a hat he was a kid everyone wanted to surround
9087493 so when he went to high school he didnt have a problem with it
9087494 the coach said when he played youd swear he was in a championship game
9087495 there were people in the stands from corner to corner and as we walked off the field everyone stood there and applauded
9087496 they played a lot of video games together and tanner and bernie would be the ones to sit for hours at a time
9087497 hes never set eyes on some of the guys coming to the visitation tonight
9087498 if youd ask tanner to get something done he usually tried to go above and beyond unfortunately he was never that organized
9087499 im just surrounding him with all his friends just to help ease the pain
9087500 id give my life to take back what hes seen
9087501 when you take a look at what took place in this process barack obama won i happen to support somebody who did not get enough delegates but in the end im supporting the candidate because we need some change in this country and thats why im going to support barack obama
9087502 this is going to be the first time that were going to have this type of convention speech since john kennedy in 1960 already weve been told that 90 000 people in denver have signed up to try to get a ticket to get into the stadium
9087503 the governors actions will put abused and neglected children at greater risk reduce access to medicaid and food stamps and further harm state parks and historic sites
9087504 he went after programs and services that truly affect peoples lives
9087505 its unfortunate to cut jobs when were understaffed in many different areas then to cut more doesnt make any sense
9087506 the governor has to make tough decisions its not easy to be governor but thats his responsibility
9087507 were in an economic downturn in illinois and the governments grown too much
9087508 we picked the parks to close based in part on attendance we also looked to see if the population area was served by another park nearby
9087509 we are dealing with the hand that is before us and we worked very hard with the governors office to minimize the impact of these cuts
9087510 our union will do everything possible to prevent layoffs protect our members and restore public services but we cant do it alone
9087511 the public needs to insist that child protection human services state parks and illinois history are too important to fall victim to the governors budget ax lawmakers should return to springfield as soon as possible to take whatever action is necessary to fix the budget and stop these cuts
9087512 i saw a guy thats coming back he definitely knows what hes doing he threw some balls 86 mph he threw some balls 88 89 he had a good curveball good split a know how guy
9087513 we have not made a final decision on that yet
9087514 were discussing some options but theres been nothing cemented along those lines we have some ideas which i dont care to share right now but that has definitely not been decided for sure
9087515 i saw some things i liked for sure but the guys pitched five innings the arm was free there was no restrictions or anything i know how the guy competes i dont worry so much about the results i liked the way he pitched
9087516 this guy last year wasnt a real hard thrower but he still was a very successful pitcher
9087517 this guy used to be a 94 95 mph thrower do i think thats ever gonna happen again thats probably questionable im not necessarily looking for that i dont think thats gonna happen but you dont have to throw 94 95 i was pleased with what i saw
9087518 his crimes were horrendous and his actions continue to haunt our family the families of the other victims and the good people of la salle county
9087519 mr weger has not worked to change himself for the better hes only tried to change his story by inventing better alibis
9087520 i dont pretend to speak for 80 some faculty members
9087521 ive noticed that the administration must have things cleared before they can take action
9087522 it seems to be in my opinion that the past president and vice presidents were given trust by this board to run the operations of this school
9087523 there are board elections in the spring and im encouraging members of the community to get more involved we have a rich tradition of success and excellence and i hate to see that diminished
9087524 we were a little nervous that first day but its going fabulous
9087525 when i found out about this program i thought it definitely met the communitys needs
9087526 scott and christie visited with the president of the imt group and explained how they are trying to answer a need that was present here in marseilles
9087527 we at the imt group are always looking to support the communities where our agents are involved and felt there was nothing any more deserving of some financial support from the company than a program such as this
9087528 all i did was line her up with the company
9087529 its a wonderful program for this community kids dont have to go home to empty houses let themselves in and take care of themselves for two or three hours waiting for their parents to come back theyre here get a snack they get education they get exercise they get their homework done thats great
9087530 we had discussion about ways people go through the grieving process there are all different ways to grieve
9087531 these are close knit groups and they have been identified to make sure they get the support they need
9087532 this kind of accident is something that makes students question their mortality
9087533 then all of a sudden he and son nick were heading out to wal mart to buy the supplies
9087534 we decided to paint different things that have to do with our family
9087535 it all just sort of fell into place after we started
9087536 we went from the flood of record to low water
9087537 i think people are fed up they are offended that so many chicago politicians seem to think they have a right to hand down a public office to their children
9087538 they dont trust us things like handing off a seat and carving voters out of the process makes it hard for them to trust us
9087539 if youre dads a fireman youre going to be interested in being a firefighter if youre dads a construction worker youre going to be interested in construction
9087540 whenever this happens it hits a nerve with the public
9087541 what tends to get peoples goats is when it appears to be very blatant when its their son or daughter
9087542 i ran on a platform of change of course thats what america was ready for
9087543 the difference between me and obama is i didnt have any money
9087544 he carried plains ga we only have 180 voters he carried my home and got all the votes in my family theres 26 of us but i think that demonstration that he has done already that the last vestiges of racial discrimination or racism are crumbling
9087545 in his inaugural address he can say when i am president of the united states we will never torture another prisoner while i am president of the united states we will never go to war against another country unless our own security is directly threatened
9087546 when i am president of the united states we will be the champion of human rights all over the earth when i am president of the united states the united states will be in the forefront of leadership of dealing with environmental questions including global warming and things of that kind
9087547 but you see in 10 minutes he could spell out for the world and for america of course the changes he could make and all of those things he could either do by executive order or he could do by just leadership
9087548 im not defending russia but we still need to be sensitive to how they feel as they are surrounded by increasingly friendly nations to the west
9087549 the purpose of nato is in effect to be an enemy of the then soviet union the more pressure we put on russia the more we are likely to see russia react in a very improper way and in a way that is what has happened so far
9087550 she outlines 12 benefits of doing the d5m with employees
9087551 its all about all the things that go with communicating and telling the truth and keeping promises
9087552 are you looking to enrich your moss portal with enhanced social computing capabilities
9087553 est s segura de que a vos no te pasa nada
9087554 from my perspective muri can be largely avoided by accepting the reality that your output each week is finite
9087555 victory means exit strategy and its important for the president to explain to us what the exit strategy is
9087556 i had doubts about the bombing campaign from the beginning i didnt think we had done enough in the diplomatic area
9087557 if we are going to commit american troops we must be certain they have a clear mission an achievable goal and an exit strategy

9087574 thats a big turning point for the chinese economy that means questions of profitability questions of unemployment questions of social stability
9087575 the chinese economy is still beset with problems including persistent prices rises uncertainties in demand abroad squeezed corporate profit margins difficulty in ensuring energy and power supplies and undue expansion of foreign exchanges reserves
9087576 for many of us its hard to raise our prices because the orders from our old clients are based on the earlier cheaper prices
9087577 some people say that the more they produce the more they lose money
9087578 were getting almost no profits from our overseas orders because of the rising cost of material labour and transportation
9087579 american clients are hesitating to send us orders because theyre afraid that they wont be able to sell the furniture and chinese exporters are reluctant to accept the orders because the profit margins are so low
9087580 but over the next several years and i dont know when its going to start the next leg is likely to be down and when the economy declines its not going to be a soft recession
9087581 this is when you discover how dysfunctional this economy was
9087582 with energy prices rising dramatically as a cost component the ability of the chinese economy to keep functioning the way it used to is in severe doubt
9087583 japan went south when non performing loans got to about 20 per cent of gdp south korea about 25 per cent
9087584 these guys chinese are conservatively at 40 per cent of gdp and then they get hit by commodity prices so for china its the perfect storm
9087585 is it going to grow at 12 per cent forever of course not
9087586 but it can grow at 6 to 10 per cent for the next five years most people would be happy with that especially as the base is getting bigger
9087587 we have to spend a lot of money on brand promotion and sales networks to develop the domestic market for our furniture

9087600 they clearly understand the security and integrity risks surrounding that application better than their typical customer does and theyre equipped to manage access controls backups and so on with great efficiency
9087601 our data is probably safer behind the providers firewall than behind our own

9087621 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9087622 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9087623 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low
9087624 its been kind of my goal the last moth or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9087625 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations
9087626 i dont really want to get into daily progress reports of how it went but it was something that we decided to do last week
9087627 were going to just keep progressing this weekend and going through next week and hopefully we can just keep feeling better
9087628 it was good to get back there doing the same things the rest of the guys were doing having to do rehab having to miss practice its not really the situation that you want to be in
9087629 so it was good to get back out there get in uniform be around the guys and hopefully that can be the sort of the norm from here on out
9087630 what is singularly important here is the fact that aqwises technology enables the facility to be built with a certain capacity now in response to existing needs and then upgraded at a later stage without having to carry out further engineering work the facility will have an initial capacity of 2 500 cubic meters of treated water a day and this will be increased to 5 000 cubic meters of treated water a day as required
9087631 this project is important not just technologically and environmentally but also politically until now the jordan river was exposed to contamination through sewage and this brought us and the jordanians to the brink of a crisis the new facility will solve this problem
9087632 we have energy companies buying to protect rigs in the gulf with the cat in the box product while coastal contracts cover the landfall of the storm and are being bought by insurers reinsurers and hedge funds

9087642 nhs trusts are not buying and selling cornflakes we are providing a public service we want nhs trade unionists to be able to speak out when they have concerns about the impact of the private and voluntary sectors taking over the provision of health services
9087643 im not seeking massive monetary benefits and i do not have grievances against the whole of the met an organisation that i dearly love and admire
9087644 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
9087645 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as the co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics
9087646 finally it is to do with the victimisation i have suffered since my grievances leaked to the media
9087647 the metropolitan police service will not at this time be commenting publicly in detail on the content of the assistant commissioners claims other than to say we do not accept the charges of discrimination against us and robustly challenge his allegations
9087648 we have only received them in the last few hours and i consider that if these proceedings have to go ahead there is a proper place for airing these matters and that is within the tribunal itself
9087649 we deeply regret that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
9087650 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
9087651 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
9087652 only last year zoom airlines made profit but that turned into a loss in the last year due to the unprecedented increase in the price of aviation fuel and the economic climate
9087653 it has become an annual excuse for the organisation behind pride to become dictators and revel in the power that they wield
9087654 little or no input is asked for or actually wanted from the very businesses that are the life blood of the whole event
9087655 small businesses sometimes rely on the big weekend itself to fund their contribution so therefore get absolutely no support no listings no encouragement and no help from pride because they havent paid up
9087656 what should be a community driven event is now a purely commercial operation established operators are shunned and overlooked for nonentity non gay organisations that just have bigger purses
9087657 many of the businesses in the village have already told us how happy they are with this years event
9087658 we consult with the village business association early in the planning process and we look forward to continuing that healthy dialogue
9087659 it was a complete success we can mention at least 20 venues who were completely happy and do not feel that phils letter comes from the majority of the village
9087660 these people have just launched into a violent attack and a man has been left with serious injuries as a result
9087661 if you recognise anyone pictured in the footage or have any information about this incident please get in touch
9087662 taking the decision to close any post office branch is always very difficult
9087663 why is the pct taking this step who made this decision and more importantly what is the cost a recent rebranding of norfolk pct to norfolk nhs cost 15 000 for signs and stationery
9087664 the pct should be putting the care of patients first instead of their public image this seems to be a trendy vanity led project that wont help the people of this borough one iota
9087665 if all 152 trusts spent the same as norfolk the total would exceed 2m we must know if it is worth it
9087666 we do not have printed letterheads our stationery is held on electronic template and items such as information booklets will only be reprinted as stocks run out
9087667 signs will be replaced when beyond economical repair and identity badges and uniforms will use the new logo only when new ones are issued
9087668 the whole process has been a sham ive now applied three times and not to have it by now is ridiculous
9087669 i filled in an application form and sent it off with a copy of my birth certificate and a bill i knew the pass would be very popular and i expected it would take a bit of time so i waited patiently
9087670 but then in march i got fed up so i called greater manchester passenger transport authority they said the information had been lost but not to worry because they were sure it had been destroyed
9087671 since then ive gone back and forth and filled in two more forms but have had nothing back
9087672 i said youve got to be joking so they said if i came into manchester they would do it there and then
9087673 but im not doing that how much would it cost me to park there im a pensioner
9087674 they reckon the personal information has been destroyed but how do they know that if it was lost
9087675 they havent a clue crooks could have my details and be filling out applications for passports and all sorts the whole thing has been an utter joke
9087676 i am sorry his attempts to apply for a travel pass have been unsuccessful
9087677 we have made arrangements to provide him with his pass as soon as possible and will look to establish why his previous attempts have been unsuccessful we have now issued more than 400 000 new smart card style national travel passes and are still receiving 2 000 applications every week
9087678 we have a dedicated team taking care of this but there is no backlog
9087679 a straightforward application should be processed in about three weeks as long as the form is filled in correctly and we have the documents we need
9087680 if people have applied for a pass more than two months ago and not yet received it and havent heard from us they should contact us as soon as possible on 0161 244 1050
9087681 the work done by pace over the last year has been the answer to a prayer
9087682 like many churches we are starved of funds so to have pace and remes efforts on our behalf highlights how lucky we are to have them in our community
9087683 regrettably we have been informed by the festival organisers that due to the withdrawal of financial backing for the event it cannot go ahead as planned
9087684 they assure us that all tickets will be fully refunded and ask people to contact directly the booking agents through whom they bought tickets
9087685 we thoroughly share the disappointment of all who planned to attend the event but fully respect the 1life organisers decision and appreciate the unfortunate circumstances that have led to the cancellation
9087686 we are looking forward to the 1life events being a success in 2009
9087687 john had always had a keen interest in music but had never felt he was good enough to play he was 13 when he asked a music teacher to teach him the piano but was told not to bother because he was not in the school choir
9087688 that destroyed him and although he maintained his love of music his desire to play only came to the fore again when he retired he didnt have a formal training in music but wanted to promote this type of education after his death
9087689 it is a substantial boost for our school of wind brass and percussion
9087690 with her passing xs final wish was ultimately granted when she did not have to see hilary clinton become president
9087691 when i get angry i want to kill the first person i see
9087692 it depends on who the first person i see is
9087693 we have two openings right now one for cashiers and one for working in the cafe they both pay a little less than you were asking for on your application
9087694 the cashiers position pays 6 75 an hour and cafe workers get 7 25 an hour do you have a preference
9087695 then ill need to think it over and get back to you
9087696 when he was diagnosed they said he might not be able to sit up because his spine might crumble
9087697 because of his bones they didnt know whether he would be able to crawl so for him to actually walk is brilliant
9087698 i follow him around but he walks on his own and its amazing we couldnt believe it
9087699 but at the back of my mind were still thinking that this could change at any minute
9087700 the other children can be really protective but he just pushes them as if to say let me get there on my own
9087701 he started trying to pull himself up on the chair and toy box because he wants to be where the other children are so his progress is kind of down to them
9087702 like katrina and rita gustav poses twin threats to the energy complex disruption of oil and gas production and damage to or interruption of refining capacity
9087703 to make a trend we need to see another string of flings in the coming weeks
9087704 but i think were certainly starting to see a foundation
9087705 of cobalt metal phosphate and an electrode placed in water
9087706 when electricity whether from a photovoltaic cell a wind turbine or any other source runs through the electrode the cobalt and phosphate form a thin film on the electrode and oxygen gas is produced
9087707 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
9087708 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains
9087709 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
9087710 its not only the weather that im not happy about here
9087711 in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar
9087712 they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
9087713 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks
9087714 can you blame him for hating manchester his team lost there last season amp when they played host to manchester they lost again
9087715 this is a very important way into wigan for thousands of people
9087716 if you are coming for the first time you could end up thinking that is what our borough is all about
9087717 i have been to america and i love the place
9087718 but i dont want to see their tastes in buildings here and in such an important location perhaps it would be appropriate in teletubby land or even in the states
9087719 but i will not support a building that appears to have been attacked by the tango man
9087720 we have consulted with neighbours and are in negotiations with the applicant about the amount of orange
9087721 wigan local authority has contacted us advising that concerns have been raised in relation to the external colour of taybarns wigan restaurant there are a number of taybarns restaurants across the country in the brand colour orange
9087722 these have been well received prior to the opening of taybarns wigan
9087723 coal fired power plants can significantly contribute to global warming and investors have the right to know all the associated risks i commend xcel energy for working with my office to establish a standard that will improve our environment and our marketplace over the long term
9087724 the new york state attorney generals office is using purported legal and regulatory claims to promote a political message by announcing an investigation of climate risk disclosure among major u s energy companies
9087725 it is unwarranted to use the legal process to advance the just say no agenda which opposes practical energy answers and has driven america to an unnecessary energy crisis
9087726 the legal system is designed to protect not harass those such as peabody which are providing clean energy solutions for america
9087727 a process intended to protect shareholders is instead being used to advance a political agenda it is already accomplishing the first objective to gain headlines for a cause that has nothing to do with investor communications
9087728 the way he has coped with it is just astonishing he is determined to beat it
9087729 he went from being so sporty and active to being completely shattered hed fall asleep during the day and lost about two stone
9087730 the tumour was 98 per cent dead so the op was a success he just has to get through a few more weeks of treatment
9087731 he was such an active lad hes sports mad and still holds the 100m record at alder he was destined to make it he cant wait to get back to school
9087732 i honestly think the damage caused by his fall could be linked to the tumour teenagers are susceptible to it
9087733 we decided to wait until we got back as we wanted to open them ourselves it was quite tense with everyone else knowing their results
9087734 weve always been quite close i think most twins are although we do have our own personalities
9087735 so it would have been quite worrying if one did better than the other as we both worked equally hard and helped each other it really helped when revising
9087736 i dont think i would have got the results i had if gavin didnt help me
9087737 the best thing is doing as well as your twin we have never been very jealous of each other but getting the same results is really good
9087738 were very fortunate at the high school to teach some extremely talented young people but a double success like this is unusual even by our standards
9087739 its amazing for them to get 21 a between them its incredible
9087740 i taught them back in year seven when they were 11 years old and it was obvious then they were going to do well
9087741 ive done work experience with george osborne and would like to study politics gavin is keen on languages and would like to work for the foreign office
9087742 government agencies have had a strong presence in this part of the city centre since the 1960s so its great news that not only have they chosen to stay here but are enhancing their presence with the relocation of the tda from london
9087743 this expansion will inevitably bring new employment opportunities for local people and help sustain manchesters economy
9087744 the tda already has close links with the north west where some of our largest high quality teacher training providers are based
9087745 thats 300 of the 30 000 jobs that are going to cause gridlock and warrant a con charge then
9087746 an out of court statement offered to prove what it says
9087747 she said shed bake a cake after church next easter sunday
9087748 while middle eastern countries could deploy pv photovoltaics to preserve valuable hydrocarbons for export
9087749 its been really crazy here all day and its so nice to finally meet someone who isnt in a big hurry
9087750 people will start to suspect that there is an ulterior motive for changing the date indeed i suspect there is an ulterior motive for wanting to change the date
9087751 you just know how many of these polling cards will sit on the mantelpiece during christmas we should have it in january when the pressure is off people
9087752 we wrote to mr nighy some time ago like we have done to a number of celebrities asking for support
9087753 he was appearing at the lowry and someone who has links to the club and ordsall also mentioned us to him
9087754 he wrote back months later apologising for the delay but he had been filming abroad
9087755 the donation from mr done went towards a 40 000 improvement to the boxing room we have also received equipment for the boxing from the army
9087756 we have raised about 375 000 now but some of the work that needs doing requires urgent attention so the cash is spent as it comes in for example revamping the kitchen and rewiring this week we will take delivery of a new boxing ring
9087757 it was not just jews at the camp there were gypsies and people who had protested against the regime people did not have enough food and were becoming ill and thin
9087758 shes a great public speaker i think people are going to like her shes a young attractive face and shes always smiling
9087759 i think theres going to be a little hot for teacher situation going on
9087760 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9087761 mccain clearly sees the power of women voters in this election but has just as clearly failed to support any of the issues that they care about his choice for vice president only reinforces that failure
9087762 for months the mccainiacs have said they will run on his judgment and experience in his first presidential decision john mccain has shown that he is willing to endanger his country potentially leaving it in the hands of someone who simply has no business being a heartbeat away from the most powerful complicated difficult job in human history
9087763 an outspoken anti abortion republican palin is an avid hunter and a lifetime member of the national rifle association
9087764 despite the apparent similarity between the gouden gids and de telefoongids directories the nma found that they do not exert significant competitive pressure on one another market evidence including surveys and past customer behaviour clearly shows that very few advertisers switch between the two directories e g in response to a price increase they rather switch to online media or even stop advertising in directories altogether without switching to an alternative therefore even if in terms of product characteristics gouden gids and de telefoongids look similar they are not each others prime competitors
9087765 whilst it finds that not all businesses currently see online platforms as an alternative to directories it notes that users are switching away from traditional directories to online search in significant numbers the nma finds that this must in time influence where businesses spend their advertising budgets and that this will constrain the merged entity post merger another implication of the two sidedness of the market
9087766 people think this must be the boom time for the debt collection industry but that is not the case
9087767 i expect well be filing more lawsuits and there are other states attorneys general who are saying the same thing
9087768 the commission receives more complaints about the debt collection industry than any other specific industry
9087769 collections companies are willing to invest more in these accounts because they will see a higher return
9087770 you might think they are targeting the people with the greatest wealth
9087771 but the data shows that almost all of the people sued by debt collectors lived in low income communities that were predominantly african american it is like profiling
9087772 some of this is 10 years old or more and beyond the statute of limitations for collection
9087773 financial institutions are recognizing that their customer base even the delinquent ones are the ones that they want to keep these consumers will come around to financial health and will be good consumers again

9087791 nothing less than a comprehensive eye and vision examination by an eye doctor was good enough for our children period
9087792 a little boy asked his grandma how old are you
9087793 there is a national movement to mandate eye and vision examinations for all school children kentucky missouri and now illinois are in the vanguard of this movement the vision first foundation an illinois 501 c 3 not for profit under the dynamic leadership of mrs janet hughes led the entire process of passing the illinois legislation vision screening is totally inadequate and must be replaced by mandated comprehensive eye and vision examinations by eye doctors you might feel i am rather braggadocios but i have been fighting for childrens rights for many years dr floyd woods
9087794 hi janet we are going the right way dont ever accept anything less than a complete functional examination by a functional optometrist your ardent admirer forever floyd the younger
9087795 we cannot and i will not let anyone ignore vision first
9087796 hi janet do not and i say again do not be discouraged the word is getting out that illinois is doing something i am encouraged and i hope you are you are accomplishing something that was unheard of in the past your ardent admirer floyd the younger
9087797 hi janet absolutely peripheral vision can be enhanced through parents can assist a child in this area through activities that demand bilateral integration awareness of the two sides of the body balancing activities would go a long way in helping a child increase awareness of peripheral vision a mini trampoline can be a very helpful tool for expanding peripheral awareness constriction of the peripheral fields both visual and auditory can create a significant problem in the learning to read process constriction of both fields occurs under the stress of learning to read we could probably write a book on this relationship try standing on one foot with eyes fixated on a target not too difficult now try standing on the other foot with eyes closed wow what a difference peripheral awareness is absolutely essential in the learning to read process janet please do not ask me these questions they get me all excited because no one is paying any attention to these most significant visual problems of our children as always your most ardent admirer floyd the younger
9087798 hi janet glad to have helped you not only do i repair patios i also do windows but dont tell dorothy keep up the great work floyd the younger
9087799 hi janet please read the section on pre school screening it is disgusting always in admiration of you floyd the younger
9087800 janet the battle is beginning to loom on the horizon we must be prepared to meet the adverse thinking with facts that are quotable and cannot be denied please do not let our detractors influence you we have the strength of the truth and our opposition must be faced with our ammunition we are in this battle for our precious children we cannot fail your ardent admirer floyd the younger
9087801 hi janet the pest is back again the evidence grows i successfully found the original article on the internet and bought it for twelve bucks i love the article because it tends to substantiate what we have been saying about hyperopia and how it correlates academic achievement with refractive error we will prevail keep up the great work as ever in your corner floyd the younger
9087802 hi janet im impressed thank you for your skills at nit picking we do not want to be redundant as a layperson in this field i think you are the best
9087803 i meant i am the layperson judging the expert your ardent admirer floyd the younger
9087804 hi janet thank you for the update i am amazed at your energy give all your wonderful kids a big hug and kiss from dorothy and me and please dont forget your very supportive and patient husband mark sr your ardent admirer floyd the younger
9087805 dear janet thank you for the great compliment i do not deserve such praise my concern is to see all children succeed at their primary job to learn i think we can help forever in your debt floyd the younger
9087806 dear janet when you get down gather your children around you give them a hug and thank god for his blessings he will give you the strength and courage to continue our journey your ardent admirer forever floyd the younger
9087807 hi janet this little vignette applies to you in every way my admiration for you increases every day floyd the younger
9087808 if i have been able to see farther than others it was because i stood on the shoulders of giants
9087809 we plan on tailgating with the best bffs in whole world
9087810 im spinnin whoa im spinnin how quick the sun can drop away
9087811 that what you fear the most could meet you half way
9087812 and sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky a human being that was given to fly
9087813 although weve got to be engaged we have to realize that ultimately we need gods direction and hand upon this country that changing a political party or changing a candidate is not going to make the ultimate difference
9087814 the ultimate difference is going to come when this nation puts in proper place its allegiance to god almighty and to jesus christ so this is a focused call upon christians to pray to fast to seek god on behalf of the nation this weekend
9087815 i need a backup in case something happens to my blackberry
9087816 pray that the storm will not just turn away from louisiana but just dissappear
9087817 secondo me te devi aiut prendendo qualcosa ke te fa st tranquilla
9087818 a friend of mine said that christians are like manure spread them out and they help everything grow better but keep them in one big pile and they stink horribly
9087819 for years i gave god leftovers and felt no shame i simply took my eyes off scripture and instead compared myself to others the bones i threw at god had more meat on them than the bones others threw so i figured i was doing fine god gets a scrap or two only because we feel guilty for giving him nothing a mumbled three minute prayer at the end of the day when we are already half asleep two crumpled up dollar bills thrown as an afterthought into the churchs fund for the poor fetch god
9087820 our greatest fear as individuals and as a church should not be failure but succeeding at things in life that dont really matter
9087821 there is often a great disparity between how we feel about faith and how we are meant to feel
9087822 the fact is i need god to help me love god
9087823 imagine going for a run while eating a box of twinkies besides being self defeating and sideache inducing it would also be near impossible you would have to stop running in order to eat the twinkies in the same way you have to stop loving and pursuing christ in order to sin when you are pursuing love running toward christ you do not have opportunity to wonder am i doing this right or did i serve enough this week when you are running toward christ you are freed up to serve love and give thanks without guilt worry or fear
9087824 hey i finally realised that 302 is the best squadron
9087825 it s a clear sign from the mccain campaign that they were going to be making a very strong bid for the women whom they see up for grabs both the traditional swing independent suburbanites and then the hillary clinton supporters who remain disillusioned

9087829 sarah palins chief qualification for being elected governor was that she was not frank murkowski
9087830 she was not elected because she was a conservative she was not elected because of her grasp of issues or because of her track record as the mayor of wasilla
9087831 i think it raises its profile i dont think it changes the steps you go through it is what it is you have to find out what happened
9087832 the pressure to come up with something is going to be intense
9087833 all of a sudden this thing has assumed much more importance than it had a week ago
9087834 im sure monegan would have come to me and said call off the dogs im feeling pressure
9087835 i am telling you honestly she really likes walt a lot but on this issue trooper wooten she feels like she doesnt know why there is absolutely no action for a year its very troubling for her and the family
9087836 if thats pressure then after years in law enforcement how do they do their job if thats perceived as pressure
9087837 the record clearly indicates a serious and concentrated pattern of unacceptable and at times illegal activity occurring over a lengthy period which establishes a course of conduct totally at odds with the ethics of our profession
9087838 this discipline is meant to be a last chance to take corrective action
9087839 you are hereby given notice that any further occurrences of these types of behaviors or incidents will not be tolerated and will result in your termination
9087840 to clarify duty hours tardiness and personal business during duty time
9087841 never put pressure on walt monegan to fire hire or fire anybody
9087842 put a leash on your sister and family or im going to bring them down
9087843 i guess i assumingly thought that he would help me sight it in and whatever you do you know to tell me show me how to do it unless he planned all along of just shooting it
9087844 once a complaint is received on a trooper more often than not it goes into what we call an administrative inquiry and thats how the discipline is handled
9087845 so we went in our living room and i had him get down on his knees so he wouldnt fall and i taped the probes to him and turned the taser on for like a second turned it off he thought that was the greatest thing in the world wanted to do it again
9087846 adrian lane said they both thought he needed to watch himself
9087847 then he whipped out his badge and said let me introduce myself im state trooper wooten
9087848 said that you guys were severely intoxicated and caused a fight in the bar and then you guys left
9087849 i was sitting there talking to him and i smelled just a faint odor of alcohol that was coming from his breath
9087850 i believe that he consumed an alcoholic beverage but i dont believe that hes intoxicated or overly intoxicated above 08
9087851 oh i can play a good sober when i need to
9087852 he would eat a fing lead bullet i will shoot him
9087853 mike in the conversation never did get to the bottom of what what the foundational issue he was dealing with he just kept screaming
9087854 clearly the folks have the ability to file complaints and the state has the obligation to investigate them and that is what was done he was disciplined appropriately so we believe in the end and you know basically end of story the only question in our mind would be has this pattern continued and has pressure been brought on anybody i mean after this whole sorry mess
9087855 this has been a tumultuous week in the department of public safety and as your governor i apologize
9087856 this is in the best interest of alaska at this point
9087857 i am an only child i am an only child and the money is all mine
9087858 the incas were people who lived a long time ago in incaland they had a highly developed civilization they would still be here today but they lacked motel facilities
9087859 some of my best term papers have been written before breakfast
9087860 the world used to admire the power of our example not the example of our power
9087861 thank you thank you very much thank you so much
9087862 saya tidak akan takut karena tidak ada yang harus dibeberkan
9087863 why am i doing this it is 11pm i dont have much battery left and i also need to go and wash me clothes but hey here goes
9087864 amend its acceptable use policy aup and establish a specific monthly data usage threshold of 250 gb month per account for all residential customers
9087865 250 gb month is an extremely large amount of data much more than a typical residential customer uses on a monthly basis
9087866 currently the median monthly data usage by our residential customers is approximately 2 3 gb
9087867 we consider whether comcast a provider of broadband internet access over cable lines may selectively target and interfere with connections of peer to peer p2p applications under the facts of this case
9087868 although comcast asserts that its conduct is necessary to ease network congestion we conclude that the companys discriminatory and arbitrary practice unduly squelches the dynamic benefits of an open and accessible internet and does not constitute reasonable network management
9087869 in which they mulled targeting the heaviest bandwidth users during periods of network traffic congestion and reduce their connection speeds for anywhere from between 10 and 20 minutes
9087870 wouldnt do it share files illegally if the charges were more reasonable
9087871 we want students to give us feedback we want people to tell us what their favorite site is so that we can continue in our evaluation
9087872 locking away vast swathes of our cultural heritage in a commercial vacuum for 45 years it was clear that they had rejected all the expert evidence in favour of voodoo economics
9087873 weve certainly lengthened the term of copyright perhaps i wont even say perhaps too long a term i think it is too long i think that was probably a big mistake but one that congress can make
9087874 if c amp d letters like this catch on canada will have to accede to the highest sic lowest common denominator of mindless copyright extensions which currently is that of mexico the latter has irrationally extended its copyright term to life 100 years talk about being nice to the usa
9087875 i do it because i like free stuff and wont get caught id do the same with anything if i knew id get away with it
9087876 there was a point to all this and it was partly to sell more i have bills to pay as well as hopefully get more people to legitimately play my games
9087877 id be very happy if some reduction of overall piracy happened too as i love pc gaming and the current situation is only helping to kill it off ive thought hard about everything people have said and i have decided to change a few things about my games
9087878 i dont think the whole exercise will have much effect on the wider industry
9087879 i wish this wasnt the case and that the devs could listen more to their potential customers and that the pirates could listen more to the devs rather than abusing them i dont think thats going to happen
9087880 but actually talking to the pirates has revealed a huge group of people who really appreciate genuinely good games some of the criticisms of my games hit home i get the impression that if i make kudos 2 not just lots better than the original but hugely overwhelmingly massively better well polished designed and balanced that a lot of would be pirates will actually buy it ive gone from being demoralized by pirates to actually inspired by them and im working harder than ever before on making my games fun and polished
9087881 ubisoft is one of the largest independent publishers and developers of video games in the world
9087882 this shows a real commitment by the authorities to stopping online copyright theft and it also highlights that forums such as these are anything but immune to the law
9087883 by the end of 2007 there were more than 1 billion pcs installed around the world and close to half had pirated unlicensed software on them
9087884 you cannot blame me although yes i am super rich but still
9087885 soulxtc i cannot wait for the day when the fbi shows up at your place and they will find you and even if you do not get thrown into the clink you will still have to pay thousands in fines fees and that lesson will change your ways and you will tell others and so on and so on i am going to show your response to some friends of mine at ubisoft i am sure they will be contacting you shortly

9087894 things have changed we feel hydrogen is a long term solution but there is no one technology that will be the silver bullet to meet transportation needs from a resource standpoint we feel a more pressing need to see how electric vehicles will affect our grid
9087895 the first solar manufacturer capable of profitably selling solar panels at as little as 99 watt
9087896 like the honda civic of 1972 the 2008 think city may be the prototype of a new automotive model
9087897 abusing the publics concern about climate change in order to promote nuclear energy
9087898 purporting it is reducing its greenhouse gas emissions while in reality its emissions are increasing
9087899 algae have great potential as a sustainable feedstock for production of diesel type fuels with a very small co2 footprint

9087901 envelope you in an atmosphere that is 15 to 20 degrees cooler than the surrounding area
9087902 internet start ups can be formed with fewer than five staffers and several hundred thousand dollars
9087903 outfits like solar and biofuels companies often require large staffs and enormous capital investments to get off the ground
9087904 that is farming at the cutting edge of technology and the fight against climate change

9087908 lenses that take on a darker tint in the sun and then fade once theyre removed from sunlight
9087909 this is a global industry and we need a global tool regional trading schemes will not work that is why 170 countries will challenge europe instead of working together to build a global trading scheme governments will be discussing legal issues
9087910 who do these airlines think they are they should pay for their emissions just as utilities and heavy industry are paying
9087911 works by moving with the waves and forcing displaced air within the buoy to drive turbine generators
9087912 1 the yields of oil from algae are orders of magnitude higher than those for traditional oilseeds and 2 algae can grow in places away from the farmlands amp forests thus minimising the damages caused to the eco and food chain systems there is a third interesting reason as well algae can be grown in sewages and next to power plant smokestacks where they digest the pollutants and give us oil
9087913 the car will float in an emergency such as a flood or tsunami and can be assembled by any two people of reasonable competence
9087914 that has significantly less impact on global warming than traditional fuel production

9088032 weve got great musicians today but they dont play any music to get those feet going out there its impossible to explain but something happens between an audience and a band a kind of electricity its one to one you and me and thats the way it goes down thats the reason the big band era happened later on it died because it got too strange and many of the groups refused to play dances it had nothing to do with rock n roll rhythm and blues punk rock or the beatles when you get up on that stand youve got to have the right tempo and the right music to tear up the world
9088033 one friday the editor got us to together and said listen lets change this from race records a lot of people were beginning to find it inappropriate come back with some ideas on tuesday there were four guys on the staff one guy said this and one guy said that and i said rhythm and blues and they said oh that sounds pretty good lets do that in the next issue that section came out as rhythm and blues instead of race

9088038 you shouldnt have to leave your hometown to find a world class job
9088039 this is all about the future the race for the future will be won when all partisanship gives way to new ideas when we put solutions over stalemate and when hope replaces fear
9088040 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
9088041 i was brought up well i live well even now
9088042 i think i kind of like it here there are some challenges but maybe it is just like where you come from there are the same challenges

9088045 i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life
9088046 i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation

9088052 but he still doesnt get it on what to do
9088053 john mccain an honorable man but is he the right republican for the future

9088057 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
9088058 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
9088059 a noun a verb and 9 11 line destroyed rudy giuliani in the primaries turning rudys overuse of september 11th into a running joke
9088060 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
9088061 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
9088062 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
9088063 my favorite things is a nice variation on the tyner coltrane classic

9088138 we had foreseen this incident but our cries fell on the deaf ears of the kuala lumpur city hall dbkl
9088139 the family affected by the incident is traumatised and had to leave the home because it was no longer safe
9088140 a fire department official told them that it was going to get worse and it did when the soil erosion happened
9088141 the officer had also asked the next door neighbour to move out
9088142 the project is neither residential nor environment friendly the dbkl however seems to be developer friendly
9088143 the developer assured us that nothing would happen but it did they said that it was safe but it is not
9088144 i think another downpour will cause the whole hill to collapse
9088145 the developer was not given the approval to start development its workers were only clearing the place but even that proved dangerous
9088146 however if the developers failed to provide the necessary documents we will issue the stop work order
9088147 the ministry and the dbkl do not have any vested interest in the development project but if the residents have proof of corruption then they should definitely lodge a report
9088148 when one part of the body suffers all of it suffers
9088149 we repeatedly told them that it was not safe to build houses on the hill but they ignored us
9088150 city hall said there was nothing to worry and they assured us our safety but what are they going to say now
9088151 they were right at 4am yesterday we received a call from a neighbour that there was another landslip thank god we werent home
9088152 they gave us reports from experts that it was safe for them to conduct work but i believe they didnt give us a complete report so this is their fault
9088153 i have to confess though that my attention was caught by a couple of points in this story
9088154 these tournaments are a lot of fun and a great opportunity for me to discuss strategy life on the poker circuit and generally catch up on whats happening in the world of devilfishpoker com
9088155 everyone now has a chance to say they knocked out the devilfish but i can guarantee you i wont make it easy for them i hate losing
9088156 wpt phil ivey decides to play without looking his cards
9088157 poker can be so cruel but please dont make any excuses

9088159 its like the monkeys in the lab and the banana
9088160 with a banana at the top of a tree eventually one will start climbing to get it
9088161 now if you start to spray the ones at ground level with water each time one climbs up for a banana they will club together to stop him because they dont want to get wet
9088162 after a while they all stop trying to get the banana and when you introduce a new monkey even though you stopped spraying water a long time ago theyll just stop him from getting the banana like they always have done before
9088163 thats not quite the story i had in mind but it amounts to the same thing
9088164 were all monkeys in trees it just depends on where you look it doesnt matter how far up the tree you go if you look down you see a sea of smiling faces if you look up its just arseholes

9088181 i used to think that life was hills and valleys you go through a dark time then you go to the mountaintop back and forth i dont believe that anymore
9088182 rather than life being hills and valleys i believe that its kind of like two rails on a railroad track and at times you have something good and something bad in your life no matter how good things are in your life there is always something bad that needs to be worked on and no matter how bad things are in your life there is always something good you can thank god for you have to learn to deal with both the good and the bad of life actually sometimes learning to deal with the good is harder

9088238 the assumption real or perceived is that if a home is on the market longer the seller may be more eager to sell and willing to negotiate more the problem

9088246 i am not teaching you techniques i am teaching you guts
9088247 your mother and brothers are out here wanting to speak with you
9088248 look closely these are my mother and brothers obedience is thicker than blood the person who obeys my heavenly fathers will is my brother and sister and mother
9088249 i want you to view what you learn with the eyes of a scholar the eyes of a humanitarian this warrior way is part of history
9088250 watch your distance youll notice when you practice you tend to move in the same fashion and with the same distance this is a bad habit that must be resolved
9088251 our misplaced trust that the newly emerging web technology would somehow deliver something that is essentially a people process because collaboration and knowledge management is about people not technology the other failure is in our management practices and a missunderstanding about how people work that information is somehow a product a word document for example that like an engine in a car factory is produced by the end of a hard days work theres no return on investment to be had in this paradigm
9088252 it reflects a very tayloristic view of the world where efficiency is to be had by motivating workers to behave in more efficient ways rather than to think smarter certainly you can offer better tools like large intranet repositories with a wealth of information inside but the synthesis of information into knowledge is a difficult task when the person who created a piece of information or a similarly empowered individual is not there to help you know where to look understand what you find and then assimilate it
9088253 the truth of most modern work is that we analyse data and information and reach out to our networks in order to gain access to knowledge we collaborate on ideas and then have a burst of work that reflects the sharing of ideas and of course once we have produced something we then tend to socialise it again within our networks in order to refine the ideas weve produced this is knowledge work in action and people are at the centre of it
9088254 the challenge is that we have been trained and conditioned by the industrial economy to strive for uniformity and to see uniqueness as undesirable variation instead of the essential quality it has become
9088255 how do we create the same thing all over again
9088256 one unintended consequence has been to make the execution of knowledge work essentially invisible making it harder to manage and improve such work attacking that invisibility opens an important path to making knowledge work manageable and improvable

9088267 at 9 30pm on the night 5 august 2007 we were assaulted by the paramilitary police while walking through the historical center of oaxaca
9088268 they loaded us into a vehicle and bent us over in stress position covering our heads for 15 minutes then imprisoned us and locked us up for one hour in a darkroom where we were subjected to insults blows threats and sexual aggression
9088269 they made us kneel with our hands on ours heads while they robbed our property money passports and immigration cards

9088273 the result is that whether or not the human rights of mexicans are protected depend on which state they live in

9088279 the act is being objected to because of the number of criminal law sanctions against live music
9088280 makes no distinction between a piano player and an orchestra or a sound system
9088281 i would have had to satisfy nine different regulatory bodies just to host an informal gig it wasnt worth it
9088282 the actual experience of licensees going through the new process was often far from the streamlined simplified efficient and less costly process that the act led them to expect
9088283 hugely damaging to musicians offering anything that isnt commercially viable
9088284 we never claimed that the licensing act would change things overnight
9088285 however it has brought many benefits such as more venues being able to put on more than two musicians
9088286 venues where people are prepared to pay a substantial sum for tickets are thriving but small scale music shouldnt be a criminal offence
9088287 local people having a sing song with a guitar is hardly the same as an organised event the law should be more flexible
9088288 the evidence so far does not suggest a widespread negative impact on live music
9088289 if this is based on their recent research neither is a reliable measure of the impact of the act on live gigs in small venues
9088290 we lobbied long and hard and then we made a conscious decision that weve got to cooperate with the dcms so we took a place on the live music forum where we can actually measure whats going on
9088291 there have been winners and losers overall the acts effect on live music has been neutral
9088292 no person shall publish or reproduce in brunei or elsewhere any part of proceedings that may have the effect of lowering or adversely affecting directly or indirectly the position dignity standing honour eminence or sovereignty of his majesty the sultan
9088293 warring rebel groups in the democratic republic of congo are stealing and selling livestock to finance a conflict sparked by spillover from the 1994 rwandan genocide in which 800 000 were killed
9088294 local authorities have certain targets monitored by the audit commission but beyond that they are accountable to the ballot box
9088295 you cant have a law if theres nobody to enforce it but we expect the ban will be largely self enforcing
9088296 these are measures designed just to get more money out of people through fines for relatively small scale things
9088297 once the ban is introduced it will result in the short term falling off sales and a reduction of revenues
9088298 these bans are largely self policing and people will respect the law
9088299 it used to be that landlords could decide who comes into their bars and who doesnt and now suddenly that space has been nationalised with new criminal offences for doing things in a place that was formerly private
9088300 were adding criminal offences at a fantastic rate in this country this is creeping towards a surveillance society and police state
9088301 part of the existing powers of environmental health officers is to gather evidence in scotland and have the similar powers people were very happy with the way the laws were being enforced
9088302 ultimately where compliance by consent is not obtained it will be the responsibility of the ehps to
9088303 were not proactively seeking out premises to break the ban mainly because we feel there will be widespread compliance in any case
9088304 we know other councils are going down a different route but we have a good relationship with our licensees and see no reason for these tactics
9088305 local authorities have opened these positions for two years but were worried they will become a permanent fixture using surveillance equipment to monitor other behaviour
9088306 councils now have an enormous amount of power and in the last year or so theyve been focusing on undercover operations
9088307 i got a letter from hackney council accusing me of not displaying my license correctly and for staying open longer than my license permits which is serious accusation
9088308 if you havent breached your license you can ignore this letter

9088379 its your fault i was asking you nicely and you just had to go mr sarcasm on me
9088380 well i just want to know if you believe in doppelgangers
9088381 thats it ch what has gotten into you and youre asking me such stupid and random questions
9088382 call it whatever you want chibisuke i dont care just answer the question its not that hard
9088383 i dont believe in doppelgangers they are not real there satisfied
9088384 i respect your choice not to believe in them chibisuke but i think youre wrong in saying they are not real
9088385 after all i did see one earlier while i was in shibuya
9088386 and you would not believe who that doppelganger chose to imitate
9088387 and get this you or should i say your doppelganger actually had a date
9088388 wait a minute you saw a doppelganger in shibuya who looks like me and that doppelganger actually had a date
9088389 i know what i saw and i wasnt hallucinating your doppelganger had a date and you wont believe me if i told you who it was
9088390 well i saw your coachs granddaughter you know the short cute one with the extra long pigtails
9088391 what was her name again ah ryuuzaki sakuno wasnt it
9088392 anyway she was your doppelgangers date and she was pretty a good choice too
9088393 yup your doppelganger has a very good taste in girls
9088394 you you really believe in this whole doppelganger stuff do you
9088395 i mean its more plausible than the idea that it was you yourself who was out on a date with the old hags granddaughter

9088413 sin as a transgression of gods law produces in man a twofold need freedom from the guilt of sin and cleansing from its defilement the first need has been met through the death of christ by which we are justified rom 5 1 8 1 2 while the second need is satisfied by the work of sanctification

9088432 but the many impressive speeches spectacular entertainment and eye pooping display of fireworks were all overshadowed by the speech ive heard many of barack obamas speeches from his keynote at the 2004 democratic convention to his address on religion and public life at our call to renewal now sojourners conference in 2006 to many of his primary orations but as was almost universally recognized by the media commentators this speech took barack obamas message and campaign to another level
9088433 the sincere applause from the huge democratic audience to barack obamas genuine recognition of mccains patriotism was a highpoint of the night i am hoping now to see that kind of applause to the recognition of barack obamas remarkable american story and patriotism at the republican convention next week in st paul
9088434 he says what does this mean am i going to have to crawl in a hole and i said no because he had no idea he doesnt even know where we are
9088435 mccain has reached for the stars and grabbed one on a recent cruise to alaska i had the pleasure of spending an afternoon with sarah palin she is brilliant and articulate and in alaska politics is a breath of fresh air as an alternative to their corruption epitomized by alaska republican senator ted stevens now obama who has spent two years preventing a woman from being president will spend two months preventing one from becoming vice president and hopes to do so with women votes the entire premise of the democratic convention was the fungibility of bush and mccain now mccain has vividly demonstrated the difference sarah palin is no dick cheney
9088436 oh those nasty catholics arent christians they molest little boys
9088437 from the east we need every man to lend a hand with the levees or the water will take most of the town

9088443 no ive seen enough i better get back to the church mother doesnt know i left
9088444 who knows how long itll take before the water finally runs off
9088445 if it gets much higher were going to get soaked
9088446 mothers going to have a conniption fit what was i thinking
9088447 were cutting through the embankment just north of the tower
9088448 its the only way we can keep the town from washing away
9088449 your mas a mite worried andi she wants to get back to the ranch afore things get worse she sent me to look for you climb aboard and ill row you to dry land

9088460 the whole first floor is covered in a foot deep layer of mud
9088461 everything in miss halls classroom is a loss your classroom upstairs escaped damage but its going to take weeks to put everything back in order
9088462 we called a hasty board meeting and decided to close school for the rest of the term
9088463 hopefully we can get the building cleaned up in time to open for the spring session
9088464 youre the best brother in the whole world to close school like this
9088465 the way those two are tearing through the house neither one will win when luisa gets finished with them ill wager they end up using the horse trough to cool their heels
9088466 i believe that will give me all the time i need for a good long soak in the tub
9088467 i thought the scolding and chores mother gave you would last longer than a few days
9088468 hush i want to hear what the boys are saying
9088469 im afraid so but dont worry chinatown turned out in full force to save their quarter they built a levee and most of their property was spared which is more than i can say for the business section of fresno
9088470 theyre still not secure the banks are soft and seeping considerable water if folks let their guard down the levees will break and well have another nice mess on our hands

9088593 wow thats impressive mr kong how did you manage to patent those words they have been around a lot longer than you or i id suggest you go and start suing every medical researcher in the world america would be a good place to start as anyone who has ever written those two words needs to pay you royalties youll probably make more money than getting some twat to prattle on about rhinocertrol on the radio furthermore to suggest our company is anything like yours is an insult i have a retail store 2 websites over 50 products including 12 manufactured under our own label is quite different to your company which has no retail presence and one product were about as similar as peter garrett and oprah let me know how you go with your lawsuits because if youre successful im going after coca cola they have been marketing their main product as the real thing for years now

9088771 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away also there was no more sea
9088772 but i saw no temple in it for the lord god almighty and the lamb are its temple and the city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god illuminated it and the lamb its light and the nations of those who are saved shall walk in its light and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it its gates shall not be shut at all by day there shall be no night there and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it but there shall by no means enter it anything that defiles or causes an abomination or a lie but only those who are written in the lambs book of life
9088773 and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him they shall see his face and his name shall be on their foreheads and there shall be no night there they need no lamp nor light of the sun for the lord god gives them light and they shall reign forever and ever
9088774 then i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god prepared as a bride adorned for her husband
9088775 and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me the great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and her light was like a most precious stone like a jasper stone clear as crystal and she had a great and high wall with twelve gates and twelve angels at the gates and names written on them which are the names of the twelve tribes of israel three gates on the east three gates on the north three gates on the south and three gates on the west now the wall of the city had twelve foundations and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb and he who talked with me had a gold reed to measure the city its gates and its wall and the city is laid out as a square and its length is as great as its breadth and the construction of its wall was of jasper and the city was pure gold like clear glass and the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kinds of precious stones the first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third chalcedony the fourth emerald the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolite the eighth beryl the ninth topaz the tenth chrysoprase the eleventh jacinth and the twelfth amethyst and the twelve gates were twelve pearls each individual gate was of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold like transparent glass
9088776 then i heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels
9088777 then the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea and it became blood as of a dead man and every living creature in the sea died
9088778 then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water and they became blood
9088779 you are righteous o lord the one who is and who was and who is to be because you have judged these things for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and you have given them blood to drink for it is their just due
9088780 even so lord god almighty true and righteous are your judgments
9088781 then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun and power was given to him to scorch men with fire and men were scorched with great heat and they blasphemed the name of god who has the power over these plagues and they did not repent and give him glory
9088782 then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast and his kingdom became full of darkness and they gnawed their tongues because of the pain and they blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pain and their sores and did not repent of their deeds
9088783 then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river euphrates and its water was dried up so that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet
9088784 behold i am coming as a thief blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame
9088785 then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air and a loud voice came out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying
9088786 the first angel sounded and hail and fire followed mingled with blood and they were thrown to the earth and a third of the trees were burned up and all green grass was burned up
9088787 then the second angel sounded and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea and a third of the sea became blood and a third of the living creatures in the sea died and a third of the ships were destroyed
9088788 then the third angel sounded and a great star fell from heaven burning like a torch and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of the water and the name of the star is wormwood and a third of the waters became wormwood and many men died from the water because it was made bitter
9088789 then the fourth angel sounded and a third of the sun was struck and a third of the moon and a third of the stars so that a third of them was darkened and a third of the day did not shine and likewise the night
9088790 woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the earth because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound
9088791 then the fifth angel sounded and i saw a star fallen from heaven to the earth and to him was given the key to the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit then out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth and to them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power they were commanded not to harm the grass of the earth or any green thing or any tree but only those men who did not have the seal of god on their foreheads and they were not given authority to kill them but to torment them for 5 months and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man in those days men will seek death and will not find it they will desire to die and death will flee from them and the shape of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle and on their heads were crowns like gold and their faces were like faces of men they had hair like womens hair and their teeth were like lions teeth and they had breastplates like breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots with many horses running into battle they had tails like scorpions and there were stings in their tails and their power was to hurt men for 5 months and they had a king over them the angel of the bottomless pit whose name is abaddon but in greek he has the name apollyon one woe is past behold still two more woes are coming after these things
9088792 then the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet
9088793 then the seventh angel sounded and there were loud voices in heaven saying
9088794 we give you thanks o lord god almighty the one who is and who was and who is to come because you have taken your great power and reigned the nations were angry and your wrath has come and the time of the dead that they should be judged and that you shall reward your servants the prophets and the saints and those who fear your name small and great and should destroy those who destroy the earth then the temple of god was opened in heaven and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple and there were lightnings noises thunderings an earthquake and great hail
9088795 then i saw an angel coming down from heaven having the key the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand he laid hold of the dragon that serpent of old who is the devil and satan and bound him for a thousand years and he cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal on him so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished but after these things he must be released for a little while
9088796 now when the thousand years has expired satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth gog and magog to gather them together to battle whose number is as the sand of the sea they went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city and fire came down from god out of heaven and devoured them and the devil who deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever
9088797 then i saw a great white throne and him who sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great standing before god and books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged according to their works by the things which were written in the books the sea gave up the dead who were in it and death and hades delivered up the dead who were in them and they were judged each one according to his works then death and hades were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and anyone not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire
9088798 i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both you and your descendants may live that you may love the lord your god that you may obey his voice and that you may cling to him for he is your life and the length of your days
9088799 it is doubtless not profitable for me to boast i will come to visions and revelations of the lord i know a man in christ who fourteen years ago whether in the body i do not know or whether out of the body i do not know god knows such a one was caught up to the third heaven and i know such a man whether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knows how he was caught up into paradise and heard inexpressible words which is not lawful for a man to utter
9088800 and you he made alive who were dead in trespasses and sins in which you once walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience
9088801 and war broke out in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon and his angels fought but they did not prevail nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer
9088802 now salvation and strength and the kingdom of god and the power of his christ have come for the accuser of our brethren who accused them before our god day and night has been cast down therefore rejoice o heavens and you who dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea for the devil has come down to you having great wrath because he knows that he has a short time now when the dragon saw that he had been cast to the earth he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child but the woman was given two wings of a great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness to her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the presence of the serpent so the serpent spewed water out of his mouth like a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood but the earth helped the woman and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon had spewed out of his mouth and the dragon was enraged with the woman and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring who keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ
9088803 gods 4 avenues to reach the lost during the tribulation
9088804 i will turn you around put hooks into your jaws and lead you out
9088805 now the word of the lord came to me saying
9088806 behold i am against you o gog the prince of rosh meschech and tubal i will turn you around put hooks into your jaws and lead you out with all your army horses and horsemen all splendidly clothed a great company with bucklers and shields all of them handling swords persia ethiopia and libya are with them with shield and helmet after many days you will be visited in the latter years you will come back into the land of those brought back from sword and gathered from many people on the mountains of israel which had long been desolate they were brought out of the nations and now all of them dwell safely you will ascend coming like a storm covering the land like a cloud you and all your troops and many peoples with you
9088807 on that day it shall come to pass that thoughts will arise in your mind and you will make an evil plan you will say i will go against a land of unwalled villages i will go to a peaceful people who dwell safely all of them dwelling without walls and having neither bars nor gates to take plunder and to take booty to stretch out your hand against the waste places that are again inhabited and against a people gathered from the nations who have acquired livestock and goods who dwell in the midst of the land
9088808 on that day when my people israel dwell safely will you not know it
9088809 i will call for a sword against gog throughout all my mountain
9088810 every mans sword will be against his brother and i will bring him to judgment with pestilence and bloodshed i will rain down on him on his troops and on the many peoples who are with him flooding rain great hailstones fire and brimstone thus i will magnify myself and sanctify myself and i will be known in the eyes of many nations then they shall know that i am the lord
9088811 then those who dwell in the cities of israel will go out and set on fire and burn the weapons both the shields and bucklers the bows and arrows the javelin and spears and they will make fires with them for seven years it will come to pass in that day that i will give gog a burial place there in israel for seven months the house of israel will be burying them in order to cleanse the land indeed all the people of the land will be burying them and they will gain renown for it on the day that i am glorified
9088812 and i will give power to my two witnesses and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days 1260 clothed in sackcloth
9088813 after these things i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth on the sea or on any tree
9088814 do not harm the earth the sea or the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god on their foreheads and i heard the number of those who were sealed one hundred and forty four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel were sealed
9088815 then i looked and behold a lamb standing on mount zion and with him one hundred and forty four thousand having his fathers name written on their foreheads these are the ones who were not defiled with women for they are virgins these are the ones who follow the lamb wherever he goes these were redeemed from among men being first fruits to god and to the lamb and in their mouth was found no guile for they are without fault before the throne of god
9088816 then i saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth to every nation tribe tongue and people saying with a loud voice
9088817 and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit on all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also on my menservants and on my maidservants i will pour out my spirit in those days and i will show wonders in the heavens and the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness the moon into blood before the coming of the great and terrible day of the lord and it shall come to pass that whoever calls on the name of the lord shall be saved for in mount zion and in jerusalem there shall be deliverance as the lord has said among the remnant whom the lord calls
9088818 after these things i looked and behold a great multitude which no one could number of all nations tribes peoples and tongues standing before the lamb clothed with white robes with palm branches in their hands and crying out with a loud voice saying
9088819 who are these arrayed in white robes and where did they come from
9088820 these are the ones who come out of the great tribulation and washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb
9088821 precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints
9088822 he who sits in the heavens shall laugh the lord shall hold them in derision
9088823 yet i have set my king on my holy hill of zion i will declare the decree the lord has said to me you are my son today i have begotten you the nations for your inheritance and the ends of the earth for your possession you shall break them with a rod of iron you shall dash them in pieces like a potters vessel
9088824 he will be great and will be called the son of the highest and the lord god will give him the throne of david and he will reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end
9088825 and in the days of these things the god of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever
9088826 i was watching in the night visions and behold one like the son of man coming with the clouds of heaven he came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him then to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom that all peoples nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom the one which shall not be destroyed
9088827 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government will be upon his shoulder and his name will be called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end upon the throne of david and over his kingdom to order it and establish it with judgment and justice from that time forward ever forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this
9088828 sing and rejoice o daughter of zion for behold i am coming and i will dwell in your midst
9088829 many nations shall be joined to the lord in that day and they shall become my people and i will dwell in your midst then you will know that the lord of hosts has sent me to you and the lord will take possession of judah as his inheritance in the holy land and will again choose jerusalem
9088830 and i will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore my tabernacle also shall be with them indeed i will be their god and they shall be my people the nations also will know that i the lord sanctify israel where my sanctuary is in their midst forevermore
9088831 the spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court and behold the glory of the lord filled the temple then i heard him speaking to me from the temple while a man stood beside me and he said to me son of man this is the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet where i will dwell in the midst of the children of israel forever no more shall the house of israel defile my holy name they nor their kings by their harlotry or with the carcasses of their kings on their high places
9088832 the inhabitants of one city shall go to another saying
9088833 let us go with you for we have heard that god is with you
9088834 but the saints of the most high shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever even forever and ever
9088835 and he who overcomes and keeps my works until the end to him i will give power over the nations
9088836 to him who overcomes i will grant to sit with me on my throne as i also overcame and sat down with my father on his throne
9088837 and i saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to jesus and for the word of god who had not worshipped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands and they lived and reigned with christ for a thousand years but the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection over such the second death has no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years
9088838 and a judgment was made in favor of the saints of the most high and the time came for the saints to possess the kingdom then the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people the saints of the most high his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and all dominions shall serve and obey him
9088839 do you not know that the saints will judge the world and if the world will be judged by you
9088840 swords will be beat into plowshares and our spears into pruning hooks
9088841 now it shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the lords house shall be established at the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and peoples shall flow to it
9088842 come and let us go to the mountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob he will teach us his ways and we shall walk in his paths
9088843 the lord will be awesome to them for he will reduce to nothing all the gods of this earth people shall worship him each from his own place indeed all the shores of the nations
9088844 and it shall come to pass that everyone who is left of all the nations which came against jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the king the lord of hosts and to keep the feast of tabernacles and it shall be that whichever of the families of the earth do not come to jerusalem to worship the king the lord of hosts on them there will be no rain if the family of egypt will not come up and enter in they shall have no rain they shall receive the plague with which the lord strikes the nations who do not come up to keep the feast of tabernacles
9088845 the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb the leopard shall lie down with the young goat the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox the nursing child shall play by the cobras hole and the weaned child shall put his hand in the vipers den they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea
9088846 the voice of the weeping shall no longer be heard in her nor the voice of crying no more shall an infant from there live but a few days nor an old man who has not fulfilled his days for the child shall die one hundred years old but the sinner being one hundred years old shall be accursed for as the days of a tree so shall be the days of my people and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth children for trouble
9088847 now i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard one of the four living creatures saying with a voice like thunder
9088848 when he opened the second seal i heard the second living creature saying
9088849 when he opened the third seal i heard the third living creature say
9088850 a quart of wheat for a denarius and 3 quarts of barley for a denarius and do not harm the oil and the wine
9088851 when he opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth living creature
9088852 when he opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held
9088853 how long o lord holy and true until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth
9088854 i looked when he opened the sixth seal and behold there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became like blood
9088855 fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who is able to stand
9088856 when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour and i saw seven angels who stand before god and to them were given seven trumpets then another angel having a golden censer came and stood at the altar and he was given much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints ascended before god from the angels hand then the angel took the censer filled it with fire from the altar and threw it to the earth and there were noises thunderings lightnings and an earthquake so the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound

9088894 so here they are in 96 98 degree weather and all these kids with no air
9088895 i can understand children needing to have some consequences if theyre not doing what theyre supposed to do but you dont turn the air conditioning off especially in houston with the weather the way it is
9088896 then what happened was that she went ahead and said that she would turn off the air conditioner you know trying to get them to be quiet
9088897 im still mad about it but at least they have done something
9088898 youre going to see a lot of people who are extremely skeptical it would seem that you would need a little more time

9088979 he can run head the ball and score goals and he hasnt cost us any money if i can get him out there 20 times a season that would give us a chance of winning 20 games he picked up a calf strain in training at united but it isnt far away from being ok now
9088980 if it was me and i was in the same situation i would be working for the club as hard as i could until told otherwise
9088981 if i didnt want to be somewhere id still give my all every training session every game some players will work in these situations and others wont its a dream for him to play for them the only thing is the way you go about doing the transfer
9088982 it doesnt give out a great message and hasnt exactly boosted the reputation of professional footballers in this country from the supporters point of view
9088983 the board have said that the deal is closed they tottenham had seven weeks to buy him but the truth is that they have never bid the 22m that we wanted they offered only 16m a player of arshavins quality is worth more than that
9088984 post offices are a vital part of our villages and communities for many people they are a lifeline and we must do all we can to protect them
9088985 i have learned that individual sub postmasters will not take these plans lying down i and my lib dem colleagues will do all we can to work with them and local residents to protect these vital services
9088986 my fear that viable businesses are being closed allowing others to go to the wall without compensation over the next two years has been confirmed
9088987 we serve a big community with many elderly and disabled customers
9088988 i think it is really important to maintain and improve this school at the heart of the brook farm estate
9088989 the last thing parents teachers and local families want is for the school grounds to be sold off for development leaving a gaping hole in the community
9088990 volunteer drivers across the county need the support of all local politicians for this campaign
9088991 i had no hesitation in signing a petition set up by my parliamentary opponent to help sustain the vital services provided by our volunteer drivers
9088992 we have an enormous opportunity to create real energy independence for the uk freeing ourselves from the shackles of foreign oil coal and gas this will require the kind of ambition and political will that succeeded in putting man on the moon
9088993 i am delighted that nick clegg is calling for a green revolution in the way we produce power
9088994 the recent russian invasion of georgia and the ongoing troubles in iraq and iran show just how dangerously reliant britain is on energy from unstable parts of the world
9088995 we have to build up our own energy supplies and as an island nation we have an abundance of natural and clean energy sources that both labour and conservative governments have failed to develop
9088996 whilst labour and the conservatives joined together earlier this year to agree britain should have a new generation of nuclear power stations liberal democrats believe this will leave a legacy of radioactive waste for future generations
9088997 the two most recent reports on the equitable life scandal by the parliamentary ombudsman and by the european parliament make very disturbing reading
9088998 its crystal clear that many equitable life policy holders lost money as a direct consequence of government regulators failing to keep close enough scrutiny of the company and act on the risks and problems that they had or should have identified
9088999 theres been a complete and repeated failure of regulation spanning more than a decade the outrage expressed by policyholders over this serial regulatory failure is entirely justified the maladministration has been appalling and they fully deserve fair compensation the government needs to accept the ombudsmans recommendation that wrongs should be remedied and act on it

9089006 every time someone has to leave for an appt or is out of the office it gets tossed in an email one of the goals is to shift this over to updates on some platform or other get it out of the in box make it available to people who are interested

9089030 theres hype about how good i am but no one has seen me play
9089031 i beat him a couple times but he got me
9089032 every week hed simulate the best defensive lineman and every week we thought he was better than the guy we faced
9089033 he can power you and hes athletic hes got a little wiggle with a defensive lineman you get them either fast or powerful what separates great defensive linemen is a guy who can do both
9089034 god gave me an obstacle to go through and i failed
9089035 then he gave me a second chance to go to servite to prove myself as a football player and student i was on the wrong track it was my fault ive changed a lot it was sort of a wake up call for me
9089036 he knows when to have fun and when to work hes got this big smile
9089037 then nobody likes me the way i play i never talk i always have my game face on
9089038 the coach kept talking to me well buy you a house if you go to my school
9089039 he was the most perfect looking guy we saw coming out of high school in plainfield n j

9089042 weve got to go back and get him a few more reps
9089043 weve been calling it the new middle school for the last two years
9089044 he considered conserving the land as the best thing to do for the environment
9089045 if we name the building after steve irwin it would be a good move on the schools part the school would get publicity and that would make more kids want to come to this school
9089046 it helps the students identify with the building and if for no other reason it helps in public relations work

9089052 i do now have to tell alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although i have only now become aware of it

9089062 i fought in the nam im a leader suck my dick because im a true patriot
9089063 i just thought i would share with you an interesting use of the litany that i saw at a wedding mass i attended while i was a seminarian the litany was used as the gathering song during the entrance i found it to be an interesting way to include the litany of the saints in the wedding mass i should add that the procession was an actual procession and not just a fancy entrance of the bride
9089064 after discussing wedding ideas with my significant other i have realized that we together know about four priests what is the appropriate role in the wedding service for extra priests are they merely guests do they concelebrate an inaccurate term but a better one eludes me the marriage
9089065 at our parish sometimes two readers share the same reading in the mass especially in the wedding mass where the bride and the bridegroom read the first reading each takes over a half i wonder if this practice is allowed
9089066 in july a wedding is scheduled to take place in our parish at our usual 6 p m mass some few parishioners are upset about this and claim that weddings must be done at a separate mass would you please explain if this is permissible i should tell you that we are in a semi rural community and our pastor as with so many priests must take care of two parishes

9089105 hmh if people are stupid that means you are stupid
9089106 some of the time sweetie everybodys stupid some of the time
9089107 i would say his physical presence and confidence and definitely his technical ability in making great saves you know making saves that other goalkeepers might not make he can pluck them out of the air
9089108 whether its the top corner or down below hes got a fantastic stretch on him
9089109 one of the big things about celtic or rangers goalkeepers for that matter is that you have got to put up with periods of time that you dont have a lot to do so that composure and that focus to the job in hand is something that you have to keep working at
9089110 hes done it quite well but there is times when he maybe just loses that a little bit and that is something that as he matures and gets more experienced he will definitely definitely get better
9089111 he makes right good saves he can be the difference at times and you can count the mistakes in one hand over the course of the season
9089112 he is quick around the area which you need to be and hes brave
9089113 you have got to have broad shoulders because if you do make a mistake you have to got to carry on and dont let the people get at you
9089114 you need to read situations very well and i think allan has got that ingredient hes sharp has good agility and commands the area more each time he plays and that comes with confidence and feeling at home in that position
9089115 its all about consistency really the more consistent you can be with pulling a match winning save i think thats what puts you at the top of the pile
9089116 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9089117 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil
9089118 it was good to be back in the side and to have got my goal but im actually disappointed that i didnt score more
9089119 to be honest i should have had a hat trick
9089120 i hit the post with a header and thought id scored again late on only for it to be ruled out for offside but thats the way it goes sometimes
9089121 the manager has plenty of options big billy showed he can be dangerous with his hat trick against dumbarton while jim hamilton has scored goals throughout his career
9089122 then theres myself dennis wyness and tom brighton who can all play through the middle as well
9089123 there are goals in this side and if we can keep playing as well as we have been then we will come good
9089124 for the first time ever ive signed someone i havent seen play
9089125 but i have spoken to a lot of people i trust in england to find out about the player and they have all been very positive
9089126 the loan moves were a massive success last season josh and sone were a breath of fresh air about the place the move was good for both of them and good for the club and hopefully it can be good for jared too
9089127 jared is a tenacious right back who is good on the ball he has played 25 to 30 games for the first team and he was dying to come here he has turned down a few offers in england to come here and that speaks volumes
9089128 three days ago i had interest from another club but i heard aberdeen were interested and my heart started pounding
9089129 my heart has been set on coming here and ive hardly slept the past three days
9089130 i watched sone aluko and josh walker playing for the club on television and they gave me the inspiration to come here
9089131 the manager gave them a chance here last season and hopefully i can get the same chance to impress
9089132 imegenes que chavez no quiere que vean fuera de vzla
9089133 we will have to have a look at them mcdonald and vennegoor of hesselink
9089134 scott has the least chance of playing jan has a better chance but we need to look at his mobility
9089135 they are both big hearted and both will want to play but i might have to stop them
9089136 there is a line drawn under it now so lets move on
9089137 were just looking for a weekend where all we talk about are fantastic games
9089138 maybe people are looking for the slightest little things with referees lets get away from that and back to talking about football
9089139 i dont think he was talking about leaving the country
9089140 he never wastes a ball and it would not be surprise to me to see him being named scotlands player of the year at the end of the season in my opinion he is that good
9089141 pedro will be marvellous for rangers and you could not meet a nicer lad i didnt want to lose him to be honest
9089142 the situation simply is that i had to sell someone to try and raise money for other things there were other players who didnt want to go and really i couldnt sell anyone other than pedro
9089143 he would have been in my team at chelsea for the first game of the season if i hadnt had to sell him two days before he wasnt surplus to requirements it was just purely down to finances and the situation
9089144 pedro is a great guy and wonderful player there is something good about his attitude you couldnt meet a nicer lad
9089145 he has been in goal for the last two matches and has not had a bad game he has not made a mistake
9089146 he did a good job on wednesday and there is big competition for our goalkeeping position now
9089147 we have three good goalkeepers and the competition is high but especially between balogh and kello it will be a very good fight
9089148 we will see what happens we have training and then i must look at our goalkeepers and make a decision
9089149 this is not easy but the players understand the situation
9089150 i dont have any positive news about this guy at the moment
9089151 it was positive that he was slowly starting with running again but he had pains and the doctors must decide what we do in the future
9089152 playing in an old firm game is very special especially the two within ten days at parkhead were very good for us
9089153 and when jan scored the last minute winner to make it 2 1 it gave us a bit of momentum and that managed to carry us through to winning the league
9089154 and if you manage to win the first old firm game of the season it sometimes gives you a bit of an edge
9089155 every game is important obviously old firm games have that extra edge to them and obviously results between the two teams throughout the season can have a bearing on the league title
9089156 i think now we have a strong squad probably stronger than last year at the minute so hopefully we can do the business and obviously surprise celtic
9089157 i think we are pretty much the same and rangers have made a lot of new signings and weve brought a few in so we know it will be a very difficult season again

9089164 absoluut alleen dringt het niet meteen door en denkt iedereen dat het wel spontaan zal herstellen door de geluidsoverlast op festivals sneuvelen vooral de haarcellen die staan in voor de hoge frequenties bij bezoekers van graspop metal meeting bijvoorbeeld waar de muziek extreem hard stond stelden we bij een kwart van de onderzoeksgroep vast dat meer dan de helft van de haarcellen die instaan voor het onderscheiden van medeklinkers eraan waren die mensen hebben het voor hun verdere leven moeilijk om een gesprek te kunnen volgen als er achtergrondgeruis is in een restaurant of in het caf bijvoorbeeld
9089165 ook handig zijn de zogenaamde musician ear plugs op maat gemaakte gehoordoppen die een leven lang meegaan je betaalt 100 150 euro voor een setje dat is nog altijd beter dan een gehoorapparaat van pakweg 2500 euro op latere leeftijd bovendien brengt een gehoorapparaat je gehoor niet terug het versterkt alleen de capaciteit van de haarcellen die overblijven
9089166 men wil een onderzoek starten naar de impact van lawaai op de gezondheid en op basis daarvan criteria opstellen voor geluidsoverlast men wil iets doen aan het lawaai
9089167 je kunt mensen niet dwingen om overal en altijd oorbeschermers te dragen dat is totaal absurd we moeten grenzen stellen aan de productie van geluid theoretisch kan dat door geluidsbegrenzers te installeren wanneer een dj of festivalorganisator zijn boekje te buiten gaat zou het geluid moeten wegvallen punt maar zolang we niet over de noodzakelijke wetgeving beschikken komt het erop aan jezelf te beschermen
9089168 gun je oren op tijd rust hou het bijvoorbeeld wat stiller tijdens de eerste 24 uur na een festival laat je mp3 speler een dagje uit op die manier krijgen de platgeslagen haarcellen de kans om weer in hun normale plooi te vallen want hoe langer je aan harde muziek wordt blootgesteld hoe groter de kans op permanente gehoorschade drie dagen rock werchter bijvoorbeeld is zeer schadelijk voor de oren wie dat doorleeft zonder oorbeschermers komt er gegarandeerd met gehavende oren uit
9089169 maar dat vluchten is dansen geworden en de resonanties in ons lichaam geven een subjectief goed gevoel
9089170 subjectief want objectief zou het meetrillen van het hart en de bloedvaten op lage frequenties juist het risico op lichamelijke klachten vergroten in de vakliteratuur verschijnen de eerste studies over de impact van geluid op hart en vaatziekten vermoeidheidsklachten enzovoort
9089171 we hebben alle orkestleden van de vlaamse opera onderzocht en zien dat ook bij hen de gehoorschade aanzienlijk is beroepsmuzikanten zijn wettelijk verplicht om oorbeschermers te dragen maar of ze dat ook doen is zeer de vraag ook voor de bezoekers klinken operas vandaag veel harder dan enkele decennia geleden de bezetting van de symfonische orkesten wordt steeds groter

9089196 we need to approach the problems of the middle east comprehensively
9089197 its interesting to see how we can find common ground in the three abrahamic faiths
9089198 typically a 50 or 60 amp electrical service was all that older houses needed and todays standards call for a minimum of 100 amps and depending on the size of the home or the amount of electrical appliances installed a 200 amp would be advisable
9089199 a 100 amp service can only support up to two large electrical appliances such as electrical water heaters whole house air conditioners electric stoves electric cook tops and ovens electric dryers and portable electric spas
9089200 as you open the circuit breaker panel where the electrical meter is located there will be a number of black switches inside known as circuit breakers and one of those will be larger than the others and its known as a main disconnect that main disconnect will have numbers on the side of it or on the face of it displaying the rating of that electrical service
9089201 many homes built before the sixties feature a two wire system an ungrounded wiring system with two prong outlets that is still acceptable by the code today as many of our devices that we plug in have a two prong cord anyway things like table lamps floor lamps clock radios television sets and those sorts of things however many new devices like computers or large kitchen appliances and laundry appliances require a grounded plug or a three prong plug and that would then require a third wire in the electrical system
9089202 that in fact creates an even bigger problem because then you have a false sense of security with a three prong outlet in the wall that really in truth is not grounded
9089203 it cost about 3 50 at your hardware store you can plug it into an outlet and it will tell you by a series of illuminated lamps on the front whether or not the outlet is properly grounded or if it has what we call a reverse polarity where the wires are actually switched backwards
9089204 under the eaves of a new home or a home thats on the market or in the garage area you can see a lot of weekend warrior type wiring if its exposed then it hasnt been installed properly and its subject to damage that way
9089205 gfi outlets can be installed very quickly by a licensed electrician in bathrooms kitchens garages and the homes exterior
9089206 this outlet senses a shock hazard say for instance you go to pick up your hairdryer and your hands are wet or slightly damp this device senses that shock potential and shuts the outlet off before the circuit breaker could trip
9089207 at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments

9089265 whoever recited the last two verses of suratul baqarah at night they will be sufficient for him

9089267 when allahs messenger saw was taken on a nocturnal journey to the seven heavens he arrived at sidrat al muntaha a tree in the seventh heaven and it is at the entrance to the seventh

9089273 i do not consider it fitting for anyone who has understood islam to sleep at night until he has recited ayatal kursi and the ending of surat al baqarah for they are a gift to your prophet saw from the treasure which lies beneath the throne
9089274 verily allah swt wrote something two thousand years before he created the heavens and the earth then he swt sent down from it two verses with which he swt sealed ended surat al baqarah the cow and if they are not recited in any house for three nights satan approaches it
9089275 verily they are both from the treasure of allah swt which lies beneath the throne
9089276 i was given fatihat al kitab and the closing verses of surat al baqarah from beneath the throne
9089277 this is a door which has opened in the heavens which has never been opened before

9089279 the messenger of allah believes in what has been revealed to him from his rabb allah swt informs us that the prophet saw has believed in the revelation given to him from his rabb
9089280 when this verse was revealed to the prophet saw he said
9089281 we hear your words 0 our rabb and we have understood them and we have acted upon them
9089282 verily allah swt has heaped praise upon you o muhammad and upon your ummah so ask and it shall be given so he asked that onthe hour the day of judgement no soul does allah place a burden greater than it can bear to the end of the verse
9089283 and whether you disclose what is in your own selves or conceal it allah will call you to account for it
9089284 our rabb condemn us not if we forget or fall into error
9089285 verily allah swt has forgiven my ummah for their unintentional mistakes and their forgetfulness and that which they do under duress
9089286 our rabb lay not on us a burden like that which you laid on those before us
9089287 our rabb lay not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear

9089352 mccain is yknow another bush in the sense were getting another very detached anti intellectual president theres a big vacuum when you have a president like that i think when you get mccain you get the worst of ronald reagan and george w bush old forgetful doddering anti intellectual
9089353 its hard to imagine a president being worse than bush but i could see mccain pulling it off

9089435 mccain represents a cold war style of nationalism that doesnt get the shift from geopolitics to geoeconomics the centrality of soft power in a multipolar world or the transformative nature of digital technology at this hinge moment in human history mccains approach to our gravest problems is hawkish denial he wants to deal with the global energy crisis by drilling and our debt crisis by cutting taxes and he responds to security challenges from georgia to iran with bush like belligerence and pique

9089502 multiplicar los talleres clandestinos y el trabajo esclavo adem s dejar completamente impunes a las marcas que se benefician de ello por ello anunciamos que en breve lanzaremos un plan de movilizaciones y esclarecimiento ante la opini n p blica a efectos de impedir la profundizaci n del trabajo esclavo que vendr a de la mano de la nueva ley
9089503 el anuncio es excelente y al fin se va a erradicar una ley que es de 1941 la nueva ley dice que una obrera a domicilio depende de la empresa que da trabajo
9089504 lo que antes eran talleres ahora ser n tomados como pymes haciendo menos engorroso el papeleo para registrarse
9089505 en aquella oportunidad la doctora rial nos pidi inmediatamente observaciones al mismo el 10 de marzo le entregamos formalmente el documento que por vez primera tendr hoy la prensa en el cual cuestionamos duramente al proyecto y sugerimos que se refuerce el poder de polic a para hacer cumplir la legislaci n vigente en lugar de cambiarla de acuerdo al paladar de los esclavistas vanamente esperamos cinco meses una respuesta y un debate al respecto mientras tanto los mismos empresarios cuestionados de usar trabajo esclavo y los sindicatos que nada hicieron para defender a los miles de costureros encerrados en talleres clandestinos aplauden rabiosamente la iniciativa
9089506 el proyecto del gobierno desregula la relaci n entre talleristas y fabricantes al convertir a los talleristas en pymes independientes de las marcas esto dejar a impune a las marcas por los lugares que escoge para su producci n y a la vez desprotegiendo a los trabajadores que deber n litigar en los fueros laborales con talleristas en su mayor parte insolventes
9089507 por cada 100 pesos que sale una prenda el tallerista recibe 3 25 y el costurero 1 89 quedando el grueso de la ganancia para los fabricantes tal estructura de costos es la madre del trabajo esclavo es a trav s de la fijaci n unilateral de los precios por parte de los fabricantes donde empieza la cadena de la explotaci n de esta manera el fabricante explota al tallerista pero peor que eso convierte adem s en el mismo acto al tallerista en explotador de los costureros esa necesidad de permanecer en el mercado es la que deriva en la superexplotaci n en condiciones indignas de los trabajadores y en los casos extremos en la esclavitud lisa y llana

9089589 its clear that joe biden will be the democrats dick cheney
9089590 joe biden is handmaiden to the special interests in washington d c that rely on war death untold carnage and the insecurity of average ordinary american citizens to have their way it is clear that a vote for the democratic party is a vote for more war
9089591 it is time to derail the war machine or we will become victims of it just as our children are victimized by the police state and the prison industrial complex
9089592 it is critical for the hip hop generation and young people among whom only one in fourteen vote or participate in elections and who see the two party system as antiquated and unable to address their issues to be able to hear other alternatives at all political debates so they can have informed voter choice and become engaged in real democracy the green party ticket represents something my generation can vote for not just an alternative but an imperative this push to have third party and independent voices in national and local debates helps all of us to make democracy work

9089599 cynthia mckinney deserves a place in the new orleans debate any presidential candidate who has qualified for enough ballot lines to achieve the necessary electoral votes to win to be elected regardless of poll numbers has earned a place in the debates the 15 threshold is being used to exclude all candidates outside of the corporate party nominees john mccain and barack obama
9089600 ms mckinney is more than just the candidate of a viable and growing party she has played a special role in the movement to help survivors of the 2005 hurricane disaster in new orleans and the gulf coast region no other presidential candidate can talk about the needs of those whove been displaced or otherwise affected by katrina the way ms mckinney can their concerns will be missing from the debate if cynthia mckinney isnt invited

9089844 the situation at our channel is about to blow up
9089845 kurtz a conservative writer recently wrote an article for the national review that looked at obamas ties to ayers a former 1960s radical who later emerged as a school reform advocate in chicago the magazine had been blocked in its initial attempts to obtain records from the university of illinois at chicago regarding a school reform initiative called the chicago annenberg challenge which obama chaired and ayers co founded
9089846 the emergence of a racial tinge to the democratic party nomination fight was all but inevitable given both hillary clintons and barack obamas training as disciples of saul alinsky hardball tactics right out of rules for radicals provide perspective for understanding the unfolding battle
9089847 shuster handled himself very well when blowhard joe was putting on his best standing drunk routine the other morning

9089929 a presidential candidates first major executive decision is selecting a running mate and john mccains unexpected choice of sarah palin inspires real confidence that a mccain administration will be a strong ally in the pro life and pro family cause
9089930 governor palin is the most pro life vice presidential candidate ever to run we are thrilled with this choice
9089931 john mccain and sarah palin have matched their public defense of life with their own personal commitment to life
9089932 im looking at him right now and i see perfection yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9089933 in both cases we see true pro family leaders they stand up strong for life in the halls of power but also live the message of life in their families
9089934 the inspired choice of sarah palin highlights the radical views of obama biden on life and marriage
9089935 catholics like most americans are cautiously optimistic that the troop surge has calmed iraq catholics will naturally turn their attention to which candidate will stand strong on behalf of families
9089936 barack obama is not that candidate barack obama wants to repeal the defense of marriage act his first act as president has nothing to do with energy or iraq he wants to enshrine the right to abortion in federal law by signing the freedom of choice act
9089937 barack obama is so extreme on abortion that he thinks that babies who survive an abortion and are miraculously born alive should be refused food and water and be left to die
9089938 john mccain together with sarah palin is a natural choice for catholics mccain has a strong pro life record and he has made a commitment to selecting judges who will respect the constitution mccain has even bucked his own party on immigration and torture we think these positions align john mccain closer to catholic teaching and we are proud to stand with him as he prepares for a very difficult election ahead
9089939 the stakes of this election are too large to ignore
9089940 jesus mary and joseph i place my soul in your hands
9089941 god forbid lord no such thing shall ever happen to you
9089942 get behind me satan you are an obstacle to me you are thinking not as god does but as human beings do
9089943 whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whoever wishes to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it what profit would there be for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life or what can one give in exchange for his life for the son of man will come with his angels in his fathers glory and then he will repay all according to his conduct

9089950 sono giorni che ti guardo da lontano lascia che ti dica il mio nome lasciami conoscerti
9089951 ammiro questa tua forza e volont di scrivere e leggere a questora ammiro tante cose di te
9089952 scrivere una necessit per me lo faccio spesso e non so se definirlo una malattia o una cura
9089953 i didnt have much choice thankfully ive never tired of it
9089954 i wanted to be able to see everyone to talk to them from here
9089955 in the interview you could tell that the writer was trying to get me to focus on the gender and appearance issues but i kept talking about energy and national security and not relying on foreign sources of energy
9089956 finally she stopped me and said i know thats what you want to talk about but this is a womens fashion magazine i dont know about fashion its bunny boots and fleece and the north face so i tried to talk about that but its just not the way im wired
9089957 one says my governor is hotter than your governor and the other one says alaska the coldest state with the hottest governor
9089958 i think those actions that i took in the past established that i would be an alaskan first before my chosen party the republican party
9089959 the hindrance some would say is that because i have done things like calling for ben stevens to step down as our national republican committeeman i dont have those communications with the partys hierarchy
9089960 i dont think of it that way though i consider it a freeing and independent position im in to do what i believe is the right thing for alaska theyre not telling me who to appoint or how to make a decision
9089961 if they can make these tax claims wed be on the hook for 52 percent of their costs its ridiculous
9089962 anybody that comes to juneau and says im not going to do my partys bidding deserves credit we had some very dark years under frank murkowski and it has been nice to see something different
9089963 shes got this even keel to her and its pretty amazing
9089964 while i like her i dont think we have the same vision about how to uplift those born without privilege
9089965 alaska is still one of only 10 states that doesnt have universal pre kindergarten education all the studies show it works and we should be educating those kids better thats been a frustration for me we just have different visions in that sense this is still a very republican state
9089966 constitutionally we are mandated to provide public education and traditionally we are talking k 12
9089967 it was always a very nonsensical budget process but with forward funding it will no longer be about fiscal funding
9089968 we have to shift that debate from how much are we going to fund to what innovative ways will lead to a better education system
9089969 her schedule dictates my schedule but with her being mayor for so many years we were already used to it
9089970 the kids are very adaptable there are thousands of alaska families that adapt whether youre a contract guy whos gone for the summer season a sloper or in the military we have a lot of families who dont have the 9 to 5 schedule
9089971 im a product of on the job training that was offered to me in 1989
9089972 i think i have the first working spouse working outside the home with a normal job
9089973 that in its first year has taken getting used to for people
9089974 when an opportunity is given to an individual it is what that person does with it that matters as i travel the state thats a big concern getting kids motivated i am meeting kids that cant read a tape measure or just dont want to work so its the same message wherever we go step out once you step out and are given an opportunity you can change a life
9089975 there are a lot of political practices in juneau that would turn your stomach and its something i still fight
9089976 a lot of practices caught her by surprise the fact that one committee chair could hold sway over so many legislators it was interesting to see someone come in and see it for themselves
9089977 as a member of the public i already was observing the obsessive partisanship that was getting in the way of doing what is right for alaska such as a republicans refusal to listen to a democrats proposal just because they were a democrat and vice versa that sort of behavior was something that i knew we had to make a commitment to change and think it has pleasantly befuddled lawmakers and some dont know how to take it
9089978 i think it was an unconventional thing to see the governor just come down and chat about an issue
9089979 for me it wasnt devastating or surprising that he didnt come out to talk to me im just sarah palin walking down the hall from the third floor to ask a question but it is a new ballgame for these legislators who were used to doing things a certain way i dont begrudge them in their hesitancy it will just take some time
9089980 the importance of having a grasp of facts figures and policies continues to be the same as when palin was on the campaign trail no it doesnt really matter just smile and talk about trust and transparency
9089981 the fact is both the operating and the capital budgets came in at a combined 350 million higher than what she promised
9089982 criticism when youre in elected office of course its expected
9089983 i will take the criticism that is constructive that is helpful if it needs to be listened to i dont mind
9089984 the irony with andrew is i am the same person with the same positions i had when he so wanted to work with me in the administration
9089985 but i hope for his sake that he can find something to be happy about
9089986 they had to go do these things because they had to go with me
9089987 enjoying the outdoors and making the most of it is what you do in alaska alaska is a participant type sport place not a spectator type place
9089988 we were up on the denali highway for her first one and she shot one up out of cantwell with todd dont pin me down on how many shes shot but theres been a few
9089989 it disappeared and we never found it again i wonder what happened to it
9089990 she can be on the phone with dick cheney and have republican senate president lyda green right outside her door and her kids call and she goes oops hold on
9089991 her kids trump everyone and i think thats pretty neat
9089992 i know i dont need a chauffeur thats for sure
9089993 besides the home life with the kids and offices in juneau and anchorage are so the only time that im alone
9089994 she told me i get home from the capital at 9 10 oclock
9089995 the lady was a good cook but the kids would rather have a hot dog than a gourmet crab cake
9089996 so they went to the senior center there in palmer and got two old people as witnesses
9089997 mccain finds vp in alaskacnn mccain chooses palin as vice presidential candidate
9089998 these individuals were not paid informants and no payments were made to them to work for the united states the co operation provided by them was not contingent upon receiving payment from the united states
