2620000 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2620001 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2620002 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2620003 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2620004 its not a tip sheet its a review of the referees performance which every coach every week gets
2620005 its a review to say yeah this referee got this decision right that referee got that decision wrong
2620006 its more or less a check for them coaches as well to fix up areas in their game that we believe in the debrief came up
2620007 so to call it a tip sheet when it suits you is probably a little bit disappointing
2620008 you can call it what you like but thats not what it is
2620009 the bottom line of it all is the referee on occasion does have issues but so does the discipline of football teams in general
2620010 itd cost me a lot of money if we had have got beaten because i wouldve unloaded
2620011 it refereeing is a tough job but theyre making it tougher for themselves by having these stupid tip sheets
2620012 they pick a couple of little things in the game previously which they so call review and they knit pick their way through a game

2620031 russia has launched a full scale military operation on air land and sea we have entered a totally new realm politically legally and diplomatically
2620032 there is almost no way we can imagine a return to the status quo

2620076 it has nothing to do with piracy concerns it has to do with different business terms expectations in that sector and more importantly generally prevailing pricing of pc digital games versus their console counterparts the typical downloadable price for digital only games on pc is actually 19 99
2620077 another consideration is that our distribution costs as a percentage are on average slightly higher on pc than console
2620078 in several cases we have another party beyond just the distribution portals taking an extra bite driving down our share of the revenue for example affiliate sites of our portal partners take a well earned slice of revenue for every sale then the portal gets its cut then we get ours three mouths to feed

2620095 nearly as i can tell they have two options they can either cut services or charge more

2620176 we alll live in the belief that we know what love is but we will always lack the
2620177 there are no accurate statistics about the number of prisoners who are tortured or have died while in prison because people dont complain
2620178 they think if your opponent is the judge whom do you bring suit against
2620179 the police refused to jail him because he had committed no crime so his older brother accused him of stealing
2620180 according to an eyewitness he experienced numerous types of torture in prison
2620181 in his last days my son told me that he would be killed showing me a stab wound on his neck and a bruise on his shoulder
2620182 the medical examiner first told me that my son had died from torture but after a few days he changed and said he had committed suicide by hanging himself
2620183 jamils mother complained to the public prosecution which subsequently ordered the prison facility not to bury dehbashs body until they had investigated his cause of death
2620184 if an individual dies in prison we immediately take him or her to the hospital if theres a complaint against the prison a medical examiner is brought in to examine the cause of death with the permission of the public prosecution
2620185 what makes this complicated is that until the whole package is done its not done
2620186 yes we have things on the table that weve agreed to
2620187 they are obviously going to be extremely attentive not just to the substance but also to the presentation
2620188 have granted us exclusive jurisdiction for u s troops and dod defense department employees the iraqis can bring forward any concerns on any cases and we may decide to let them handle it
2620189 we gave them notice to leave but they refused their makeshift homes would have developed into a neighborhood which is against the citys plan
2620190 we admit the land doesnt belong to us but we have found a suitable place to live we could not pay the monthly rents in sanaa
2620191 with al mashaqir yemeni women become so attractive even with wrinkles that cover their faces
2620192 a brief mention may be made of the generation of other animals so far as the subject admits of brevity in this manner our argument will best attain a due proportion on the subject of animals then the following remarks may be offered of the men who came into the world those who were cowards or led unrighteous lives may with reason be supposed to have changed into the nature of women in the second generation
2620193 that part of the human race which is by nature prone to secrecy and stealth on account of their weakness i mean the female sex has been left without regulation by the legislator which is a great mistake
2620194 in comparison with mans bodily condition the bodily condition of woman is one of weakness and this comparative weakness points toward a retiring domestic role within the home
2620195 the womans decisions and actions are too often guided by pleasures and pains so that she is unfit for leadership and very much in need of temperance
2620196 she waits waits waits and finally gives a birth to a girl
2620197 how then can a woman teach her children both boy and girl virtues if she has only these two qualities how can a muslim community uphold these thoughts while we have verses in quran contrary to this
2620198 when we told the hospitals criminal investigations office that there was a patient near its fence they replied this patient has hiv but had no companion or even an identification card so we ejected him
2620199 while its true that there was no one to look after him no one from the hospital threw him out we never do that he somehow got out by himself
2620200 they refuse to send someone to look after those ethiopian hiv patients without companions whereas the somali embassy does do this
2620201 however we have 14 hiv positive refugees with identification cards issued by the united nations high commissioner for refugees all of whom have documents to receive treatment at the hospital
2620202 no one from al jumhury hospital called us regarding that patient and in fact the last time i was there i looked after two female ethiopian patients whom we sent back to ethiopia
2620203 in order to determine whether a patient is ethiopian i ask for their identification cards i then speak to him or her in amharic to determine the exact area from which he or she comes
2620204 the ethiopians here in yemen are from different tribes each with its own committee to help those in need the ethiopian community gives ethiopian patients medicine money or a companion to help them if the patient needs to stay in the hospital
2620205 our hospital isnt responsible for those on the streets only if the patient is inside the hospital are we responsible
2620206 while i have paid hospital staff to wash this african refugees body the one who was on the street for three days i want to remind the public that al jumhury hospital isnt a refuge for aids patients its a treatment center
2620207 a patient can come to us to receive medicine or a consultation and then return home
2620208 we are arranging to meet with unhcr to discuss the problem of hiv positive refugees entering yemen without id cards
2620209 most unidentified aids patients arrive during the latter stages of the disease which means they require much more care and medicine
2620210 hiv positive patients families should bring them to the hospital to receive medication not dump them alone in front of the hospital
2620211 its not only refugees who face discrimination regarding hiv as yemenis also are subjected to it everywhere they go
2620212 when i took my then pregnant wife who also is hiv positive to deliver our baby in sanaa three large hospitals refused to take her after i informed them that she was hiv positive
2620213 i finally was forced to hide the fact that shes hiv positive as i had been advised by the national aids control program
2620214 she was left for two days on the floor of the hospital corridor with no food or water when i asked for food for her a health worker put some food inside a plastic bag and threw it at her i called the national aids control program manager and he came and asked for another person living with hiv to look after her
2620215 we are concerned about the community but they dont care about us
2620216 when i told my dentist that im hiv positive he accused me of adultery and asked me to leave
2620217 we need specially trained doctors to take care of aids patients while those who already have such training should pay more attention to aids patients
2620218 there are hiv positive people who have been forced out of mosques and their neighborhoods however i dont blame ordinary citizens
2620219 people can have their own guns in their homes for self defense
2620220 however they have to register their guns so that in the case of a crime or an incident of self defense the guns used can be easily identified
2620221 i dont want to see guns in the streets i really encourage the government to chase those carrying arms
2620222 i always come to the library to see what our predecessors handed down to us i am very proud to find a library like this in my country
2620223 i am very pleased to see the good condition of the al ahqaf manuscript library these days and to see that catalogues and access are available to researchers and scholars
2620224 this is a rich heritage so we hope that future generations protect it for those who will follow us
2620225 the library still does not draw sufficient interest or support from the government or have sufficient financial supplies even though it is a one of the most unique intellectual establishments in yemen
2620226 the opportunity to acquire these manuscripts passes us by and we do not know where they end up
2620227 first of all records really never left they just got pushed to the side because of all the hype on cds
2620228 we then find out that cds arent all they were hyped up to be and the price really never came down like they claimed plus they are digital binary sound
2620229 the record industry did keep pressing records during this time except it was on a much smaller scale people who still owned turntables from the middle price range to high end always knew that a clean record lp was superior to the cd in sound if the record was an analog pressing in which almost all are
2620230 weve had a retail store for over ten years from 1988 2000 and went to the world wide web and decided after seven years to reopen the retail store im glad we did because i have previous customers from the past come in and i ask them what they have done for the past seven years and almost all say they still been spinning their vinyl and are glad we are back open thats a dedicated customer also weve made many new friends world wide who love the sound of records over cds countries in the u k germany sweden holland spain japan australia etc are all pressing and selling vinyl
2620231 im so amazed that almost all of my customers know that vinyl records are analog and cds are digital plus they know the difference that analog is a continuous sound wave and cds are sampled and chopped up in bits this can get a lot deeper but i dont want to get into that but you can just google in analog vs digital and it will give you the true scoop
2620232 finally i can say that most of the major record labels are up and pressing again not everything is getting pressing but lots of great artists
2620233 vinyl lps analog sound is primarily the reason lps sound better than cds it all comes down to a true continuous sound wave length vs digital sound bits with a gap between each sampled bit the system you play your records on is very important and there are quite a few variables that play a role in the sound you hear power source turntable speakers and more all come into play it can pretty deep and expensive if you want to go for the high end equipment
2620234 from what i understand is that if we took an analog pressing and tried to convert it from its source to a computer it first must go through a process converting it to binary numbers so the computer can read it so i would say yes your correct in saying that digital sound is a binary sound into bits
2620235 actually when i first open my store in 1988 i promised myself and the store that the store came first it paid my rent and let me buy more inventory to make a better store so really i personally dont have huge collection for myself i do have my favorite bands such as the rolling stones the doors beatles and pink floyd you get the idea classic rock
2620236 i have a bachelors degree in teacher college and couldnt find a teaching job in the area back in the 1970s 80s so i decided to open a retail record store
2620237 thrill and adrenaline rush that i get while crate digging what are your thoughts about record collecting
2620238 its like an easter egg hunt for me im always thumbing through record stores while on vacation looking for that rare find
2620239 i seem to always see something from the 60s or 70s i havent seen in the past
2620240 the internet is the tough place to grade records because in the retail store i leave the record open for the buyer to inspect i try to be tough on grading because i hate to have returns on the internet we grade record amp cover as a m extremely clean looks amp sounds like a new record vg possible small wear but looks and plays close to new vg minor scuffs possible small noise but no skips and plays ok vg usually end up in my 1 00 section or the goodwill
2620241 i would say that classic rock is really the best right now from college kids to the baby boomers they all seem to be playing this genre jazz and blues hold their own but i have to stick with the classic rock
2620242 our online inventory is about 6 000 records we have added a few more but since we opened the retail store ive kind of got a little behind on the data basing of our inventory we have a little over 15 000 items in the store
2620243 ebay is fine for what they do but i really dont sell much there ive had a few of the high dollars items and moved them on ebay but i really dont sell any of the 8 00 to 15 00 records there i would rather sell them on our site at www backtrackrecords com or www musicstack com or www gemm com
2620244 one of the best finds was an original 1958 buddy holly
2620245 five years from now i see vinyl records still holding their own in the market
2620246 high end tube equipment seems to coming into the scene more and more
2620247 an audiophile record is mastered at better equipped mastering plants such as mobile fidelity classic records speakers corne and the like
2620248 regular records sound good on a middle range turntable high end turntables and equipment need high end quality records you are wasting your hard earned cash if you play a high end record on a low end turntable

2620297 my boy that was incredible fantastic i didnt think it could be done well i must keep my end of the bargain do you want my daughter or the one million dollars
2620298 listen i dont want your money nor do i want your daughter i want the person who pushed me in that water
2620299 we depend heavily on the proceeds from our annual hot nights cool blues event that would have been in its fourth consecutive year at sweetwater
2620300 the 45 50 ticket prices came with a lot of great food music and prizes but the best part was that sweetwater owners are animal lovers and allowed us to raise almost 5 000 every year for programs and services that are already in the works and waiting for payment we really count on getting this money in and now were just hoping local pet owners and animal lovers will be generous and send a check directly to us at njafa
2620301 i signed up more than 25 animals to be spayed and neutered and we have already purchased flea prevention medication and gave it to camden residents whose dogs are suffering terribly from the heat i also found two 10 day old kittens on the street out there and have been bottle feeding them
2620302 two winters ago i raised enough money to have 40 wooden dog houses built with flaps and straw and delivered to dogs living outside in lower socio economic areas
2620303 unlike other events that may have been scheduled there that now will be cancelled njafa cannot survive without this event and will not be able to continue our services and will have to stop all services we appeal to the generosity of the community

2620310 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2620311 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2620312 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency

2620321 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2620322 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2620323 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2620324 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2620325 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2620326 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2620327 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

2620329 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
2620330 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
2620331 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2620332 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2620333 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2620334 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2620335 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2620336 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2620337 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2620338 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2620339 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2620340 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2620341 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2620342 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2620343 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2620344 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2620345 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2620346 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2620347 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2620348 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2620349 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2620350 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2620351 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2620352 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2620353 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2620354 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2620355 one of the issues around looking at the impact of seizures is that were not quite sure what impact they have because the issue of stockpiling
2620356 we know with a range of other substances like heroin and amphetamines that theres a high level of stockpiling that goes on so when there is a seizure it doesnt necessarily translate to reduced access to the drug on the street
2620357 our sense is that yes this is a big seizure we need to watch it very carefully in terms of the impact but our past history would tell us that the impact at the street level will be minimal if anything
2620358 people would not be sending this quantity of product to australia without a realistic expectation that they stand to be able to move all of this product
2620359 so what youre looking at is a truly phenomenal demand in australia for these sorts of drugs in the modern era
2620360 disrespect you huh let me show you what disrespect is buddy
2620361 the statements from the whole group result in a total lack of coherence from which we easily conclude that theyre all lying
2620362 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible to include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents lack of communication is torture
2620363 there is a sense of anger frustration and great sadness theyve waited for this evidence of sightings for a long time its work they could have started 15 months ago but this is the time for them to keep focus and consider everything carefully before deciding what course of action to take then they will have their day they will make their views clear
2620364 i believe he can recommend charges or action be taken against the police as a whole as well as individual officers
2620365 the early stages of the investigation led by detectives in portimao really were very poor
2620366 a number of people had touched the window and entered madeleines and the twins room prior to the arrival of the gnr local police
2620367 her eyes met mine as i walked past and thats when i saw the little blemish in her right eye it was like a little fleck
2620368 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
2620369 one must suppose that the child madeleine mccann could have died inside the apartment
2620370 the whole attitude throughout was one of we think theyre involved there are some vague indications lets throw caution to the wind and see if we can get a conviction
2620371 the documents are a field of potential leads and any one of them could unlock the case they will never give up the search for madeleine
2620372 a network with all kinds of criminal activities really does exist but the authorities dont want to look into it
2620373 in general paedophiles ask for a particular type of abuse rather than a particular child
2620374 the majority of sexual abuse occurs in the home or by people the child knows
2620375 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2620376 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2620377 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2620378 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2620379 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2620380 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2620381 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2620382 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2620383 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2620384 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2620385 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2620386 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2620387 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2620388 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2620389 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2620390 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2620391 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2620392 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2620393 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2620394 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2620395 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2620396 we have already changed ip for the website that makes it work for half the isps again and we want you all to inform your italian friends to switch their dns to opendns so they can bypass their isps filters this will also let them bypass the other filters installed by the italian government as a bonus and for the meanwhile http labaia org works la baia means the bay in italian
2620397 over five million animals are euthanized each year in america i plan to be part of the solution to lower this number and i look forward to all of you to be part of the solution as well building bigger shelters is not the answer spaying and neutering is
2620398 your work serves as a shining example of the mission and values of st francis
2620399 we are dedicated to helping animals in all counties of new jersey but focus our dedication and compassion for camden city new jerseys animals
2620400 because we are headquartered in camden county a camden county animal receives a major portion of our funding for spaying and neutering and when we have the funds for needed medical procedures
2620401 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2620402 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2620403 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2620404 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2620405 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2620406 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2620407 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2620408 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2620409 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2620410 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2620411 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2620412 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2620413 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2620414 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2620415 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2620416 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2620417 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2620418 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2620419 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2620420 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2620421 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
2620422 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2620423 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
2620424 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2620425 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2620426 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2620427 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2620428 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2620429 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2620430 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2620431 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2620432 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2620433 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2620434 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2620435 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2620436 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2620437 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2620438 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2620439 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2620440 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2620441 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2620442 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2620443 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2620444 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2620445 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2620446 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2620447 lebih banyak kita hanya mengahabiskan waktu untuk hal hal yang tidak perlu
2620448 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
2620449 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
2620450 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
2620451 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2620452 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2620453 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2620454 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2620455 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2620456 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
2620457 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
2620458 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
2620459 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
2620460 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
2620461 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
2620462 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
2620463 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
2620464 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
2620465 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
2620466 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
2620467 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
2620468 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
2620469 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
2620470 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
2620471 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
2620472 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
2620473 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
2620474 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
2620475 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2620476 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
2620477 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2620478 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up
2620479 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2620480 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2620481 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2620482 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2620483 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2620484 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2620485 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2620486 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2620487 just so you all know we did set a record
2620488 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2620489 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2620490 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2620491 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2620492 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2620493 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2620494 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2620495 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2620496 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2620497 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2620498 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2620499 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2620500 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2620501 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2620502 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2620503 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2620504 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2620505 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2620506 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2620507 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2620508 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2620509 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2620510 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2620511 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2620512 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2620513 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2620514 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2620515 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2620516 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2620517 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2620518 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2620519 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2620520 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2620521 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2620522 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2620523 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2620524 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2620525 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2620526 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2620527 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2620528 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2620529 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2620530 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2620531 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2620532 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2620533 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2620534 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2620535 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2620536 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2620537 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2620538 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2620539 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2620540 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2620541 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2620542 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2620543 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2620544 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2620545 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2620546 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2620547 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2620548 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2620549 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2620550 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2620551 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2620552 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2620553 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2620554 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2620555 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2620556 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2620557 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2620558 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2620559 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2620560 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2620561 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2620562 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2620563 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2620564 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2620565 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2620566 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2620567 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2620568 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2620569 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2620570 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2620571 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2620572 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2620573 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2620574 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2620575 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2620576 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2620577 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2620578 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2620579 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2620580 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2620581 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2620582 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2620583 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2620584 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2620585 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2620586 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2620587 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2620588 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2620589 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2620590 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2620591 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2620592 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2620593 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2620594 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2620595 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2620596 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2620597 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2620598 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2620599 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2620600 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2620601 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2620602 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2620603 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2620604 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2620605 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2620606 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2620607 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2620608 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2620609 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2620610 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2620611 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2620612 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2620613 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2620614 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2620615 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2620616 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2620617 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2620618 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2620619 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2620620 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2620621 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2620622 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2620623 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2620624 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2620625 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2620626 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
2620627 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2620628 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2620629 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2620630 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2620631 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2620632 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2620633 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2620634 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2620635 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2620636 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2620637 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2620638 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2620639 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2620640 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2620641 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2620642 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2620643 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2620644 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2620645 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2620646 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2620647 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2620648 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2620649 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2620650 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2620651 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2620652 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2620653 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
2620654 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
2620655 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
2620656 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2620657 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
2620658 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
2620659 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
2620660 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
2620661 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
2620662 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
2620663 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
2620664 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2620665 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
2620666 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
2620667 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left
2620668 the police of the world as well as judge jury and executioner
2620669 i think a two by four will work just fine i just need to apply it a little less sparingly
2620670 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
2620671 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying
2620672 an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party
2620673 how about compensation for jews kicked out all over the world
2620674 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2620675 for mainstream american blacks the vast majority of churches have hebrew names
2620676 infered black muslim bho fit with this jew hatred or kinda love maybe here
2620677 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
2620678 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2620679 considering the circumstances the best thing the palestinians could do is accept their fate and negotiate an agreement leading to the creation of a sovereign nation encompassing th gaza strip and west bank
2620680 why should any citizens be carrying guns and why one group but not the other are the arabs more of a threat to the jews than the jews are to the arabs
2620681 the real point as noticed here by one of americas most prominent one man bloggers is that the brits are actually leading the way in pointing out to the world that american faults are generally over reported and american strengths under reported
2620682 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the
2620683 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to

2620687 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
2620688 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2620689 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2620690 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2620691 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday

2620694 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2620695 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2620696 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2620697 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2620698 come to me all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light

2620722 its a shame you dont act yourself jared i really miss the real you just be you and stop acting sometime atleast around me okay
2620723 there is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation there is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize there is a failure here that topples all our success

2620739 although the name jared creates the urge to be reliable and responsible we emphasize that it causes procrastination lack of confidence and the inability to realize your goals and ambitions this name when combined with the last name can frustrate happiness contentment and success as well as cause health weaknesses and worry or mental tension the name of jared has made you serious minded responsible and stable you love the security of a home and family you are fond of children and as a parent you would be fair and understanding although you have good business judgment you are not aggressive in your dealings because you do not like to create issues you would be successful in any position dealing with the public as you have a diplomatic and tactful manner and possess a charming easy going nature which puts people at ease people are drawn to you because they feel that you are patient kind understanding and responsive
2620740 perfect guy hmm he has to be funny smart but not too smart you cant be too much smarter than me and you have to be taller than me

2620754 high police visibility due to past incidence of bomb attacks and unsolved vigilante style killings
2620755 what is so appalling is the seeming boldness and brazen manner the attack was staged showing no fear or not even a bit of respect for the authorities

2620802 i was walking and glanced down and it caught my eye because it was in the concrete it must have been done when it was wet
2620803 the council removed it quickly at least thats a positive but i was surprised to be asked a question like that to be honest this is something i fear is constant throughout the uk and not specific to camden council if people are not educated as to what a swastika is how can they be expected to know if it is offensive
2620804 if someone finds the graffiti offensive well remove it in 24 hours if its not offensive and is of a more general nature itll take longer
2620805 it shows a profound failure by ms matthews to understand the horror of hitlers nazi machine
2620806 early this morning the seattle police department received notification that one of our officers was involved in an off duty shooting in sturgis south dakota
2620807 we believe that four other off duty seattle police officers were present when the shooting occurred
2620808 the seattle police department considers this a matter of utmost seriousness
2620809 all five officers will be placed on administrative reassignment relieved of duty pending further investigation by the south dakota authorities
2620810 when i started working at irwindale speedway it was because of my own interest
2620811 i volunteered to work for free at the dodge weekly racing series it was something that i wanted to do i was a l a girl and there was a short track close by 30 miles from l a it had nothing to do with me wanting to help nascar diversify its sport
2620812 once i was working at irwindale and i got real great reviews from my bosses magic johnson heard about me because shav glick wrote a story about me that appeared in the l a times magic read it and invited me to speak on behalf of nascar at an event to celebrate john mack the former president of the l a urban league
2620813 mauricia is a great asset to our officiating crew and to the track in general
2620814 her enthusiasm seems perfectly matched by her ability to learn weve asked the people at the automotive training center to please send us more like her
2620815 shes not only one of the hardest working track officials shes the most friendly
2620816 if any of those claims turn out to be accurate and have substance we would have liked to have known about that two years ago so that we could react and have done something about it because its inconsistent with anything from a policy standpoint about how a work environment for our officials should be
2620817 she chose to make this about money and about a lawsuit
2620818 from officials to fans i do get looks i find myself keeping my hands in my pockets i love the sport but there are a lot of places i wouldnt go im sorry but its just a fact
2620819 no matter what age you are or what interests you have there is a social networking site out there for you
2620820 i just signed up today and am already hearing back from my team leader after i asked for help sfi really does use the team philosophy
2620821 im new to sfi and i have already received my first commission check i was amazed at the amount you can receive if you work hard ive seen a lot of quick rich schemes out there sfi is in a class by itself ill be with them for years to come
2620822 sfi offers the perfect opportunity for a disabled veteran like myself to add to my monthly income i think that this is the best system that i have found to produce an income that will be both growing steadily i am looking forward to building my network and building residual income with sfi
2620823 first of all records really never left they just got pushed to the side because of all the hype on cds
2620824 we then find out that cds arent all they were hyped up to be and the price really never came down like they claimed plus they are digital binary sound
2620825 the record industry did keep pressing records during this time except it was on a much smaller scale people who still owned turntables from the middle price range to high end always knew that a clean record lp was superior to the cd in sound if the record was an analog pressing in which almost all are
2620826 weve had a retail store for over ten years from 1988 2000 and went to the world wide web and decided after seven years to reopen the retail store im glad we did because i have previous customers from the past come in and i ask them what they have done for the past seven years and almost all say they still been spinning their vinyl and are glad we are back open thats a dedicated customer also weve made many new friends world wide who love the sound of records over cds countries in the u k germany sweden holland spain japan australia etc are all pressing and selling vinyl
2620827 im so amazed that almost all of my customers know that vinyl records are analog and cds are digital plus they know the difference that analog is a continuous sound wave and cds are sampled and chopped up in bits this can get a lot deeper but i dont want to get into that but you can just google in analog vs digital and it will give you the true scoop
2620828 finally i can say that most of the major record labels are up and pressing again not everything is getting pressing but lots of great artists
2620829 vinyl lps analog sound is primarily the reason lps sound better than cds it all comes down to a true continuous sound wave length vs digital sound bits with a gap between each sampled bit the system you play your records on is very important and there are quite a few variables that play a role in the sound you hear power source turntable speakers and more all come into play it can pretty deep and expensive if you want to go for the high end equipment
2620830 from what i understand is that if we took an analog pressing and tried to convert it from its source to a computer it first must go through a process converting it to binary numbers so the computer can read it so i would say yes your correct in saying that digital sound is a binary sound into bits
2620831 actually when i first open my store in 1988 i promised myself and the store that the store came first it paid my rent and let me buy more inventory to make a better store so really i personally dont have huge collection for myself i do have my favorite bands such as the rolling stones the doors beatles and pink floyd you get the idea classic rock
2620832 i have a bachelors degree in teacher college and couldnt find a teaching job in the area back in the 1970s 80s so i decided to open a retail record store
2620833 thrill and adrenaline rush that i get while crate digging what are your thoughts about record collecting
2620834 its like an easter egg hunt for me im always thumbing through record stores while on vacation looking for that rare find
2620835 i seem to always see something from the 60s or 70s i havent seen in the past
2620836 the internet is the tough place to grade records because in the retail store i leave the record open for the buyer to inspect i try to be tough on grading because i hate to have returns on the internet we grade record amp cover as a m extremely clean looks amp sounds like a new record vg possible small wear but looks and plays close to new vg minor scuffs possible small noise but no skips and plays ok vg usually end up in my 1 00 section or the goodwill
2620837 i would say that classic rock is really the best right now from college kids to the baby boomers they all seem to be playing this genre jazz and blues hold their own but i have to stick with the classic rock
2620838 our online inventory is about 6 000 records we have added a few more but since we opened the retail store ive kind of got a little behind on the data basing of our inventory we have a little over 15 000 items in the store
2620839 ebay is fine for what they do but i really dont sell much there ive had a few of the high dollars items and moved them on ebay but i really dont sell any of the 8 00 to 15 00 records there i would rather sell them on our site at www gemm com
2620840 one of the best finds was an original 1958 buddy holly
2620841 five years from now i see vinyl records still holding their own in the market
2620842 high end tube equipment seems to coming into the scene more and more
2620843 an audiophile record is mastered at better equipped mastering plants such as mobile fidelity classic records speakers corne and the like
2620844 regular records sound good on a middle range turntable high end turntables and equipment need high end quality records you are wasting your hard earned cash if you play a high end record on a low end turntable
2620845 i do thank you martha but i dont think a little cough is enough to warrant a doctor
2620846 you men are all so stubborn my daddys just like you
2620847 martha hes making up rules to excuse his poor playing
2620848 you two are acting like children its hard to believe you are in your twenties
2620849 remind me why making everyone around us utterly jealous is fun
2620850 theres so much doom and gloom out there but weve just finished the best july ever
2620851 guests are staying longer and are making more visits folks are still spending money but theyre spending it locally here on our property using the spa beach and dining
2620852 were the only one with a private beach and were a lot busier than last year
2620853 i like it because the beaches are clean here and it feels like youre far away from home
2620854 we were going to go to napa but the drive here is much more manageable
2620855 we fly so much its so much easier to get tin the car and drive we havent left the hotel weve walked on the beach eaten at the restaurants and hung out at the pool
2620856 its not the hippy surf town i remember my grandparents who lived in riverside bought this old surf shack on the 1950s and now weve renovated it we come back every year its like our legacy to our grandparents
2620857 its very eclectic here and all the locals know each other
2620858 i was eating at caf vienna and a lady came and said arent you jacksons mom i felt just like a local
2620859 everyone seems like theyre on holiday nice cars cruising around and everyone wears clothes like theyre on vacation
2620860 i dont know anywhere else you can go into a an art gallery in sandy flip flops
2620861 the suspect julian reeve wanted for the murder of melanie light kidnapped nine year old devon turner blonde curls blue eyes 65 pounds could be under the alias of devon light he is said to be armed and dangerous

2620863 i could tell she was a little fearful but wasnt about to abandon her egg case
2620864 tim why did you waste your time debunking something so obviously stupid
2620865 a new word needs to be coined to describe what the investors business daily editorial staff did with rasool and schneider
2620866 we expect ice age if aerosols increase by a factor of four above current 1971 levels and then stay there
2620867 if co2 exceeds 450 ppm disintegration of the ice sheets
2620868 if co2 exceeds 450 ppm and if models have it right disintegration of the summer sea ice in the arctic
2620869 do you have any source link or quote that makes rasool schneider an
2620870 uncertainty exists about the time for ice sheets to respond to climate change ipcc 2001 hansen 2005a but analyses in this paper and comparison with atmospheric composition in prior warm periods hansen et al 2007b suggest that a co2 level exceeding 450 ppm is almost surely dangerous and the ceiling may be even lower reduction of non co2 forcings provides some flexibility in the co2 ceiling
2620871 i dont think hansen and his 46 co authors are right because i dont like hansen
2620872 it should be pointed out that the major weakness of our model lies not so much in the adopted values for various parameters but rather in the fact that it is a static model of a dynamic atmosphere the answers to these questions can only be obtained by coupling the radiative effect of aerosols or co2 to a realistic global dynamic model of the atmosphere which should also include any effects of aerosol particles on the microphysics of clouds 4 only then will we be able to predict the ultimate effects of changes in aerosol and co2 concentrations on the global climate meanwhile we still believe that multiple scattering computations even on a global average basis are instructive and a necessary first step in the modeling of this problem
2620873 science is a conspiracy using peer review and secretive structures to silence brave honest whistle blowers
2620874 can you prove that this wont disrupt the carbon cycle
2620875 what did he know and when did he know it
2620876 im just a lowly graduate student at a world renown institution sir i have no real opinions of my own
2620877 james hansens code was used as a black box 36 years ago in a paper that estimated climate forcing sensitivities therefore hes an alarmist and part of some evil green conspiracy
2620878 long term historical data says solar fluctuations almost certainly overwhelm co2 effects as cause hansen and agw acolytes say based on speculative models that they dont like that data where i come from they call that politics
2620879 thinker faker spinner spy corporate pr and the assault on democracy
2620880 that the big ice ball hypothesis was more likely than not
2620881 at this point in the history of society and its knowledge we cannot say how the climate will vary in the future but we can say with certainty that it will vary
2620882 there is no danger of an ice age coming next year or next decade but minor and major climatic anomalies have occurred and most certainly will occur again
2620883 the potential effects of co2 production on climate therefore merit closer attention
2620884 my own feeling is that climatic theory is still too primitive to prove with much certainty whether the relatively small increases in co2 and aerosols up to 1976 have been responsible for the observed climatic changes we have recently documented

2620894 i must write in public because the judge pz has decided that is part of my sentence for graduating from this particular form of torture that i or my parents if i am really lucky have paid for and yet those jerks are still going after me for nothing other than the joy of being jerks

2620912 the strike authorization vote demonstrates members solid support for their bargaining team and their strong determination to achieve a fair settlement with qwest
2620913 the truth is our leaders want a contract not to call a strike
2620914 the fact they did authorize one doesnt make it any more likely
2620915 were hopeful we will reach an agreement in a timely manner

2620925 weve known in the medical community that that dispatch center has been seriously under performing for 10 years
2620926 the moment an alpharetta 911 dispatcher logs in an emergency call the rural metro ambulance staff immediately receives the information
2620927 there was a huge lapse of time from fulton county to us
2620928 saves us a good three or four minutes in most cases
2620929 and three or four minutes can be the difference between life and death in some situations
2620930 the less the call is handled the less the response time and the less the margin of error
2620931 it doesnt leave me with a whole lot of confidence in the 911 system
2620932 public opinion deserves to be respected as well as august 10 2008 the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics successfully expressed chinas arrival of the global stage as a global power the new china made its presence felt with grandeur that is the olympic movements parodic symbol of excess the excess signified that china has successfully modernized from being a backward power a century ago but the rules of the game of global power are set by the west and they have been changed in the last couple of decades modernization is no longer enough
2620933 this government prepares world class athletes so dont blame us for bread shortages but look instead at the incompetence of your local officials
2620934 it helps the championship its another win it ties the record for most wins in a season so its a fantastic day for us
2620935 to catch him castroneves on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2620936 the process i was put through is a warning to journalists who would defy radical islam
2620937 that was an unbelievable tournament and after that brazil game everyone was talking about a football revolution about how new zealand football had finally woken up for the first time since 82 the world cup finals but we didnt kick on
2620938 if we can just hold on for that first 20 25 minutes and weather the storm then find our legs brazil like china will get three or four really good chances and it just depends if they take one of them
2620939 the attack into afghanistan in 1979 its like czechoslovakia when soviet and russian tanks moved in if they get away with this in georgia the world will be in trouble
2620940 what aspect of brit culture and history will you present jousting knights the queen prince charles talking to plants burning and beheading of catholic and protestant heretics fox hunt this galls the animal rightists more than the burning of heretics
2620941 they want to know that their money is really getting to the kids
2620942 even though you might have only fifty dollars to give
2620943 were going to treat our donors the way the ford foundation treats someone who has 1 million to give
2620944 the smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion but allow very lively debate within that spectrum even encourage the more critical and dissident views that gives people the sense that theres free thinking going on while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate
2620945 if the kids werent being graded theyd never do it
2620946 both parents and students must be willing to embrace the work component of homework to recognize the quiet satisfaction that comes from practice and drill
2620947 yes homework is sometimes dull or too easy or too difficult that doesnt mean that it shouldnt be taken seriously
2620948 need to take on the sometimes adversarial and perverse authoritarian role of taskmaster
2620949 teachers at this school give me useful suggestions about how to help my child with schoolwork
2620950 homework assignments allow me to see what my student is being taught and how he she is learning
2620951 the amount of homework my child receives is choose one too much just right too little
2620952 this is a historical moment which fulfill our dream for 100 years

2620982 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2620983 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2620984 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2620985 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2620986 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private

2620990 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2620991 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2620992 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2620993 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2620994 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2620995 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2620996 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2620997 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2620998 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2620999 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2621000 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2621001 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2621002 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2621024 the rm10 hourly allowance for on call doctors is grossly unfair
2621025 on the other hand our counterparts at the health clinics are being paid rm80 hourly for treating patients with coughs and flu
2621026 we dont have to work long hours and the workload is also not that heavy at health clinics
2621027 being on call is something that all government doctors have to do while working overtime is voluntary you cannot compare working overtime with being on call

2621041 dr bass feels terrible about the passing of these individuals
2621042 they were his patients and he treated them but he was not responsible legally or otherwise for their unfortunate deaths
2621043 he has a complete and utter disdain for human life the laws the regulations
2621044 fans had heard he was going to watch former doctor who star catherine so they turned up in force complete with props
2621045 he was very charming and friendly with them during the interval but he was rightly disgusted when they disrupted her performance by singing the shows music and waving their sonic screwdrivers
2621046 catherine is a pro so she ignored them but david knew the only way to stop them was by getting up and leaving

2621051 so every time im working on it im really really happy
2621052 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2621053 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important

2621057 i love every morning getting up to go to work because that little boy inside of me jumps with excitement every time i know im going to fight an alien or shoot a rocket gun or be on a spaceship or be with the doctor or get onto the tardis

2621060 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
2621061 being a mother has taught me more about the grace of god and my own shortcomings than any other experience in my life i see gods grace every morning as they wake up healthy and strong as they laugh and giggle as they run and play as their minds develop right before my eyes my biggest lesson learned is to cherish every moment with your children they grow too fast god never gives you more than you can handle and i am going to do all that i can for my little ones especially when they face challenges
2621062 true some of the lessons theyve taught me were not very fun as they were happening but the good moments mix up with the not so good moments in a wonderful curriculum ordained for me by god himself
2621063 i honestly can say that being a mother is the most powerful and important feeling in the world
2621064 god gave me strength when i couldnt go on life when my body was trying to shut down encouragement to my broken heart meals when the refrigerator was empty a place to live when ends did not meet peace in the midst of turmoil and a contentment that went beyond my circumstances sure life gets hard now and then my heart may still become anxious and my mind may begin to assume the worse but today i know that contentment comes from within i have learned to be content regardless of my circumstances because god is faithful to me i am so very blessed
2621065 this is the place i come to share my stories thoughts prayers battles struggles and victories as a christian mom
2621066 thanks to the help and prayers of everyone inside and outside the hospital and all over the world we once again have triumphed over this trial

2621086 our grant will be used for the nomad plus project this project aims to empower young people most of which find themselves living rough on the streets or in temporary accommodation because of difficulties at home this grant will help to pay for bus fares in order that clients are able to attend the nomad plus group work sessions
2621087 the give as you rent scheme has benefited the young women s housing project for a number of years the latest grant was used to help set up and run our project parent group this is an opportunity for young isolated mum s to get together and support each other this has been a forum for discussing parenting issues and sharing experiences as well as promoting positive parenting
2621088 i am very proud of the students for raising this much money to help sheffield s homeless the initiative supports groups working with the homeless and isolated of sheffield and gives students the opportunity to play a vital role in this local issue
2621089 i want to say a big thank you to all the students who have supported the scheme this academic year the money raised will help to improve the quality of life for those individuals who are suffering from poverty and homelessness and hopefully allow them to get back on their feet
2621090 we started the fundraising for the china earthquake appeal to reflect the strong feelings of all the chinese students and scholars in sheffield we want to take this opportunity to thank our volunteers for their dedication and to all the staff and students at the university who supported us with donations
2621091 thank you to all the university of sheffield staff and students connected with this fantastic fundraising effort for the red cross china earthquake appeal to mobilise such a strong team of enthusiastic volunteers in such a short space of time was a brilliant achievement but to raise so much money was outstanding
2621092 we are thrilled that the information commons architectural team has been recognised for creating such an iconic building for the university
2621093 the information commons grew out of a shared vision for the future of it enabled student learning space and we re delighted that the riba has recognised the amount of innovative thinking that went into it
2621094 we are delighted to win a riba award for the information commons building our unique and innovative design reflects the university of sheffields bold vision and celebrates real team collaboration
2621095 i don t think it was the common people getting buried at stonehenge it was clearly a special place at that time one has to assume anyone buried there had some good credentials
2621096 the people buried here must have been drawn from a very small and select living population archaeologists have long speculated about whether stonehenge was put up by prehistoric chiefs perhaps even ancient royalty and the new results suggest that not only is this likely to have been the case but it also was the resting place of their mortal remains
2621097 this project has pushed the boundaries of what is achievable to provide remarkable results
2621098 the exhibition is all about stimulating the public conscience in visual and dramatic ways and empowering people to dream about alternative ways of consuming
2621099 we are living in extraordinary and urgent times no one person has the solutions to some of mankind s greatest challenges now is the time to bring science art and business together and through beautiful audacity rigor and awe help to change our environment for the better
2621100 when the carvings were made the car was still a luxury public transport was limited except in the city and local journeys were still commonly made by foot
2621101 considering how traffic speeds through this landscape today and the fact that inscriptions have not been fashioned here for more than half a century what s most peculiar about this place is its former pace of life
2621102 the act of tree carving is not at all like the hurried penmanship of a writer or the airbrush strokes of the urban graffiti tagger it requires a good knife a bit of elbow grease and time to spare the carvings speak of less hurried engagements of quarrymen or agricultural labourers on their walk to work of soldiers marking their presence on their way to war or local people punctuating their journey to or from the grenoside pubs they speak of lingering presences
2621103 depending on the materials used and heating system selected it is perfectly realistic to dramatically reduce the amount of energy needed to heat homes and offices i would go as far as saying that it will be possible to heat a family home for even less than 100 per year perhaps as low as 50 in the very best circumstances
2621104 ian is a leading figure at the cutting edge of energy efficient building and his expertise will add enormously to our specialist team s capability in designing homes and buildings
2621105 winning this award is a fantastic achievement this award is particularly satisfying as it reflects the national student movement acknowledging us to be the best union it also demonstrates the rewards that can be gained through excellent collaboration between student leadership and staff support
2621106 this is a fantastic opportunity to hear from a man who worked so closely with tony blair and to gain an insight into his role at number 10 it is also a great chance to support the broomhill festival which is raising crucial funds for key charities
2621107 as a department we are delighted to be hosting the opening concert of the broomhill festival the festival is in aid of very good causes and it is wonderful to be able to showcase the skills of our students and staff to the local community as we prepare to relocate to our new home on the main university campus this is a time to celebrate our time in broomhill and thank the community for all their support
2621108 children and robots are a good mix children love robots of every kind they like to drive them around by remote control and they like to play games with them robots therefore are a great teaching aid to inspire our next generation of engineers and scientists and recent studies show that they may be a useful therapeutic aid for those with autism
2621109 however i have my concerns about their use in childcare these robots may be great for monitoring children as adults can log into the robot from the internet or from their mobile phones they can also direct the robot and see through its cameras and even speak to the children through the robots voice
2621110 but my concern is that they may prove to be too useful with more and more people working from home on their computers it would be all too easy to leave the kids with a robot and watch what is going on in the corner of your computer screen eventually childcare professionals may use these robots this may be quite safe and entertaining but what kind of role model is a robot could this lead to a generation of social misfits what does this say about the value placed on children in society
2621111 currently it would not be legal to use these robots to mind children in a nursery without adults being present but it would be perfectly legal to use them in the home
2621112 it is a great honour to be recognised in this way by my peers and by the iadr the credit for this award should be shared with the many colleagues and research students who have worked with me over many years
2621113 the aim of this activity day is to give the teenagers an exciting insight into the legal profession and give them the opportunity to debate current affairs topics in new ways listen to other points of view and see how law relates to their everyday lives
2621114 by offering an interesting and diverse programme and introducing them to role models we hope to inspire the teenagers and encourage them to think about their dreams and how they can achieve them
2621115 as one of the top law schools in the country we are in an excellent position to offer our expertise and experience to the region s teenagers
2621116 we hope to give young people a better understanding of the legal profession what it takes to study law and how to stand out when applying for a course which is highly competitive
2621117 the aim of professor fluffy s medical adventure is to introduce the idea of higher education and what it is all about at an earlier age
2621118 we ran this event for the first time last year and it was a real success the children were so enthusiastic and many left the event telling me how they really wanted to work hard so they could become a doctor
2621119 this is a unique opportunity for pupils from local primary schools to work with staff and students from the university of sheffield and alongside the world renowned scientist professor sir harold kroto
2621120 we are extremely grateful to sheffield united and tony currie for their support with this event and hope the experience will ignite the youngsters interest in science and inspire them to raise their own aspirations to achieve at the highest level in their future studies
2621121 i am delighted to be running my workshop for schoolchildren in sheffield the city where i really advanced my passion for science
2621122 we need as many young people as possible to learn to appreciate both the excitement of discovery and the crucial importance of science and technology for the future of society science helps us understand the many big problems that out planet now faces and is our major hope for finding solutions that we need to sustain our present way of life
2621123 i m really looking forward to working with the kids and discovering a whole new world with such a distinguished scientist i never thought a football would be something used to help communicate science it sounds fascinating
2621124 i am absolutely delighted to become the third hea national teaching fellow here in sheffield it is a great honour for me personally and it is wonderful that our efforts to provide the very best educational experience to our students have been recognised once more i am especially grateful to all my colleagues in the department the university and the white rose centre for excellence in the teaching and learning of enterprise without whose support over many years none of this would have been possible
2621125 i am delighted that the hea has recognised john for the way he has led significant developments in teaching practices both within his own department and more widely across the university
2621126 john is an asset to the university his colleagues and the students he teaches we are extremely proud to have him on our staff
2621127 the presentations the young people gave were all of an extremely high standard and the ideas they had were fantastic they had obviously put a lot of hard work and effort into the campaigns
2621128 this was an absolutely fantastic event i am extremely impressed with how the teams developed their ideas into very strong and well thought campaigns they have learned so much not only about their projects but also in terms of personal skills
2621129 coasteering is an extremely difficult and dangerous sport and you need a lot of training and support to carry out such a challenge
2621130 breaking the current world record would be amazing but what really matters to us is raising as much money as possible for the sheffield children s hospital charity having spent time working at the hospital as a medical student i know just what a difference fundraising can make
2621131 terence and adam are incredibly brave to take on such a daring charity challenge and we are delighted they have chosen to support our research appeal coasteering is a very exciting but extreme sport and we wish them lots of luck for the world record attempt
2621132 i took up the visiting professorship because i was very flattered to be asked and because i wanted to show todays students that anyone can succeed eventually it took me a bit of time to get where i am today but once i had found my niche something i am passionate about everything else just seemed to fall into place
2621133 i m really looking forward to visiting the university in november it will be an opportunity to engage with staff students and members of the local community as well a chance to visit some of my old haunts from my university days i feel like i never really left sheffield though i have relatives in the city and whenever i visit i always feel at home
2621134 the appointment of lee as a visiting professor not only recognises his extraordinary literary talent but also celebrates his excellence and distinctiveness as a sheffield graduate
2621135 we are delighted that lee is so fond of both the university and the city and that he is so enthusiastic about sharing his skills and knowledge with our students staff and members of the local community he is a modest charming and inspirational character who we are proud to welcome back to sheffield
2621136 we are very pleased to welcome nick clegg to the university and to be able to show him some of the innovative assistive technology being developed politicians and governments around the world are taking a keen interest in better ways of delivering better care and more support to vulnerable older people and i believe that new technologies will play a major part in this
2621137 i m delighted to have the opportunity to visit the advanced care technologies programme i am interested to see for myself some of the innovative products which are being developed by the project in the care and support of frail older and vulnerable people these are of course vital for supporting the growing needs of our ageing population
2621138 this is a wonderful opportunity to see some of the treasures from our amazing collection of posters and ephemera with over seventy large scale framed posters 100 smaller handbills on display and over 100 posters from leisure parcs archive the exhibition covers the full spectrum of popular entertainment including variety artists such as betty driver george formby strange entertainments optical and magic early cinema and circus these are the gems of the national fairground archive collection
2621139 bringing the treasures from the nfa with the amazing heritage of blackpool s entertainment history from the leisure parcs archive and displaying them in blackpool the home of entertainment is what truly makes these exhibitions special
2621140 the summer school has been running for many years and every year it gets bigger and better with more departments and employees getting involved
2621141 the students had a great time this year and it was lovely to see so many friendships formed and young people who didn t want to leave because they enjoyed it so much
2621142 the summer school is a great opportunity for teenagers to find out more about the university what the city has to offer and to make new friends i came to the summer school in 2003 and was so impressed with it that i decided i wanted to study here i was so pleased when i got in and was delighted when i found out a friend i met on the summer school had got in too it was the best decision i ever made coming to sheffield which is why i was so enthusiastic about helping out with the summer school this year
2621143 i really enjoyed the summer school especially the visit to thompsons solicitors i learnt really interesting facts about the firm and the different jobs within it i also learnt a lot about what you can do after a law degree
2621144 we are pleased to announce the expanded 10 year agreement with the university of sheffield and the associated fundraising
2621145 biofusion is a leading university ip commercialisation business and today s news endorses our current business model and reflects positively on the relationship that we have already built with the university
2621146 biofusion has a portfolio of companies with potentially disruptive ip in some exciting new markets such as knee imaging wind turbine motors lensless microscopy and renewable energy the expanded ip pipeline increases the potential for the development of new blockbuster companies in these growing markets we look forward to working with our partners and creating value for investors
2621147 we welcome this new agreement with biofusion biofusion has grown out of the university into a muti million pound group which we are extremely proud to be associated with the commercialisation of all non life science research generated intellectual property is a positive step that will allow more of our academics to turn their world class research into successful enterprises
2621148 i am delighted to have won this award and to have had the opportunity to meet such an acclaimed actress like judi dench
2621149 i wouldn t be where i am today though without the help and support i received from the staff at the university of sheffield s drama studio and my fellow students from sutco sutco allowed me to develop my passion for stage and theatre and gave me an expansive portfolio that eventually helped me get my place at rada i think something many students forget when choosing a university is that the extra curricular activities offered are also extremely important and in my case helped me get where i am today
2621150 during the time claire spent working at the drama studio as a member of sutco both my colleague reuben and i recognised she had a lot of potential and would make a great theatre professional
2621151 we are delighted that her talent has been recognised with a lilian baylis award and we wish her all the best in her future career
2621152 the university is delighted to have been given the opportunity to support mcs projects science and technology challenge day through innovative team challenges the participants are exposed to many different aspects of science technology and engineering and stimulated to see careers in these fields as an exciting prospect
2621153 our science and technology challenge days encourage children to enjoy solving practical science and technology related problems they also help to dispel myths and perceived barriers to higher education by giving young people the chance to experience university life first hand and by working and learning from current university students
2621154 summer volidays is all about getting people who have never volunteered before involved in activities and showing them how fun and rewarding it can be for students it is also a great opportunity to give something back to the community before they leave for their summer break
2621155 i am extremely grateful to all the staff and student volunteers who have decided to get involved and who are making a positive contribution to the city in which they work and study
2621156 we are delighted that the university of sheffield is supporting our attempts to ensure that everything is in place for the hospice opening in september at the moment the proposed garden is a strip of baron land rather reminiscent of a former building site and our resources are all being stretched to the limit to provide essential medical equipment and furniture for the opening we are really pleased that sheffieldvolunteering has once again come to the rescue
2621157 bioscience researchers in the uk have not only pursued excellent world class research but they have also been active in ensuring that we all benefit from their efforts
2621158 in order to remain globally competitive and meet the future challenges of living within our environmental and population limits it is vital that bioscience researchers continue to maximise the positive economic and social impacts of their research and activities
2621159 we hope that this research will provide the opportunity to develop suitable compounds to overcome the resistance of some weeds to conventional herbicides used today in addition to strengthening industrial and academic partnerships
2621160 it has been very exciting to work in partnership with the scientists at syngenta in a project with such potential to actually make a difference to agricultural practices worldwide to the benefit of the uk both socially and economically we feel this recognition serves to highlight the importance of collaborative research and keep the uk at the forefront of global bioscience
2621161 our systematic review which looked at the findings of hundreds of existing research studies has found very consistent evidence on the effect of alcohol pricing on alcohol consumption and related harm the evidence shows that if prices increase consumption decreases this is worrying given that alcohol has become increasingly affordable in the past decade especially in supermarkets and off licenses to give an idea of scale the evidence shows that a 10 price increase is associated with a 4 to 8 reduction in consumption
2621162 we know that certain glycol ethers can affect male fertility and the use of these has reduced over the past two decades however our results suggest that they are still a workplace hazard and that further work is needed to reduce such exposure
2621163 infertile men are often concerned about whether chemicals they are exposed to in the workplace are harming their fertility therefore it is reassuring to know that on the whole the risk seems to be quite low
2621164 the network of researchers will contribute to new technologies derived from breakthroughs in the field from areas as diverse as developing cheap anti malarial drugs for 3rd world countries to non greenhouse producing biofuels such as hydrogen
2621165 synthetic biology is an exciting new currently evolving field at the interface of bioscience and engineering
2621166 by developing this emerging science the uk will continue to keep its leading edge and increase its international competitiveness for the future this initiative is aimed at raising uk profile and capability in this area to put the country at the forefront of the field
2621167 soams presented me with many opportunities which allowed me to acquire and develop various new skills which would benefit me not only whilst applying to study medicine but also beyond this stage of my career i am sincerely grateful to all the staff who worked on soams and who gave me invaluable support and guidance and enabled me to achieve my dream of becoming a doctor
2621168 we are immensely proud of all the soams participants who have graduated from sheffield s school of medicine and biomedical sciences this year
2621169 on behalf of the soams team and the outreach amp access section i would like to convey my congratulations to all those who have graduated and wish them every success as they embark upon their career as doctors
2621170 while the experiments did not show that offenders receiving restorative justice were more likely to stop offending completely we found that offenders committed less crime overall because they slowed down their rate of offending and reduced the overall cost of the crimes they committed
2621171 these results leave little doubt that restorative justice is both effective and cost effective at preventing crime since 75 of all convictions in england and wales are reconvictions of repeat offenders in principle we could see restorative justice reduce crime substantially across the country
2621172 these results now mean that 10 out of 12 tests of restorative justice have reduced the frequency of repeat offending in the uk us and australia
2621173 as the results from the thames valley probation experiment show restorative justice may be especially useful for violent offenders coming out of prison if they are willing to meet their victims and work out an accommodation our own evidence shows that restorative justice reduced victim desire for revenge in eight out of eight tests in australia and the uk and the sheffield report shows 33 less repeat offending among offenders coming out of prison after restorative justice than without it
2621174 this module has given the students a valuable learning experience allowing them to access academic knowledge and professional skills and then apply both in the context of a real life engagement between university and community classroom and pier end
2621175 i am delighted that as part of admission all classes that we can incorporate the skills and talent of our students to help bring to life blackpool s entertainment heritage i have worked with the students on numerous occasions in the run up to the show and i am confident that the students will put on a show that will keep blackpool visitors of all ages entertained
2621176 we are all really excited about performing in blackpool we have learnt so much over the past few weeks about the history of popular entertainment and it has been fascinating we now hope we can translate what we have learnt into a captivating show that makes a walk on the north pier like a step back in history but with a modern twist
2621177 i regretted not having the opportunity to wear my academic robes and pick up my degree certificate in person now thanks to my daughter and the university i have been able to experience my graduation day i would like to thank my family and the university for this remarkable gesture
2621178 it has been a fantastic day and i am so pleased that i have had the opportunity to graduate
2621179 we felt that it was the right time to engage in the debate on issues surrounding the purpose of university and how it should be funded our panel of key decision makers and figureheads from around the sector provided a lively debate and gave students the opportunity to ask the questions that really mattered to them
2621180 this event was a great opportunity to talk openly about key issues in higher education and to hear from students about their concerns and needs it was a valuable experience for me and it demonstrated one of the reasons why universities are so important as they provide a forum for debate and an arena to challenge ideas
2621181 this was a valuable opportunity to debate with students the important issue of university funding as we approach the variable fees review in 2009 its crucial that the higher education sector as a whole has an informed debate on this subject
2621182 students are central to universities existence so this was a welcome opportunity to hear their views and those of an impressive panel of speakers
2621183 its really exciting to receive something like this especially when you re not expecting it i really enjoy my scientific work in the school of medicine and biomedical sciences at sheffield and i am looking forward to sharing our results with colleagues at the conference
2621184 munitta is a bright hard working young scientist with an excellent career ahead of her in translational cancer research i m delighted to hear that her innovative approach to her work has been recognised by this award she certainly deserves it
2621185 mapping the zebra finch genome is tremendously exciting for several reasons first it provides far greater understanding into how bird genomes have evolved over the last 100 million years for example we now know that bird genomes are not as evolutionarily conserved as was once thought
2621186 second the map will be a great resource to researchers all over the world the zebra finch is a model organism in several biological disciplines and the map provides the resource to find the genes responsible for variation in bird characteristics it is very likely that genes discovered in this species will have similar effects in humans as well
2621187 this award is clearly a great honour to be awarded a medal simply for having done the things that i enjoy doing is extremely fortunate i have had the privilege to work and compete with some very intelligent talented and devoted people during my two years at sheffield and i feel i owe a lot to them for their support in helping me achieve this accolade
2621188 it was such a lovely surprise when i received the letter from the university about the award i really enjoyed my time at the university and the support i received from my tutors and head of department was brilliant it was difficult studying training and competing all at the same time but i was determined to get a degree i really appreciate being recognised in this way and i hope it shows other young people that if you have that drive and enthusiasm to succeed you can achieve anything you want
2621189 paul and jessica are two outstanding graduates who i feel extremely proud to list as our alumni they have both shown tremendous commitment to their chosen fields and have been ambassadors for both the university and the city of sheffield
2621190 i wish them both well in their chosen careers and want to thank them for the excellent contribution they have made whilst at sheffield i also wish jessica a speedy recovery and hope to see her competing on the international circuit again soon
2621191 we knew that interest in the old bailey site would be high and we planned for this however we were overwhelmed by just how strong the demand from all over the world turned out to be luckily our technology was not overwhelmed and the website was actually only down for a very short time the outstanding staff who run the hris digital operations working closely with sheffields excellent corporate information and computing services were able to ensure that our users patience was quickly rewarded with a rapidly improved service
2621192 more dedicated research into mnd is clearly needed and the proposed institute in sheffield which is being strongly supported by the university of sheffield and the city is a major building block to finding a cure
2621193 i am very pleased to do what i can to help and i was delighted to accept the invitation to be honorary patron of the foundation i am looking forward to visiting the university and learning more about the proposed institute and its research team
2621194 i am delighted and deeply honoured that the duke is lending his support as honorary patron to the development of the sheffield institute of translational neuroscience
2621195 i believe that the creation of the institute will enable us to assemble the manpower and funding needed to generate much more effective therapies for patients with mnd it will be a world leading institute and a real beacon of international excellence for the city and the university of sheffield
2621196 this project is the first of its kind it europe and will have the potential to offer real hope to all sufferers of mnd
2621197 we are delighted that so many students have successfully completed the award and that so many teachers and parents could be at the ceremony to celebrate their success the awards promote excellence in achievement and attainment and all the students their families and teachers who attended the ceremony must be congratulated on their success in working together to achieve this outcome
2621198 we were delighted to win the relay championships particularly as the club has never won the trophy before for me it topped off a fantastic weekend winning two gold medals is brilliant these races were a real confidence boost for the european championships which are also being held on sand dune terrain im really looking forward to it
2621199 we are aiming to develop solutions to address existing and future problems in radioactive waste management as well as training the next generation of engineers to put these solutions into practice sheffield has a key role to play in this national effort
2621200 this is an exciting collaboration at sheffield between two strong groups that bridge fundamental molecular science and practical engineering solutions to real problems
2621201 the sheffield legal fair is a great chance for the best firms in the legal business to meet up with some of the brightest up and coming legal brains in the region if you re interested in a career in the legal sector then this is an event you cannot afford to miss
2621202 for anyone interested in variety or for those who are curious as to what it is all about this is a perfect opportunity to see a string of exciting and fascinating acts in a spectacular show admission all classes is all about revitalising and celebrating blackpool s rich entertainment heritage and we hope members of the public will join us in this celebration and come and appreciate what blackpool has to offer
2621203 this is not the sort of variety show you would see today although it does have elements of that linked with many acts which celebrate the titillating and sometimes racy past of this distinct theatrical form
2621204 it s spice without the sleaze as a veritable feast of performances including unique and rare acts of class and character will please and astonish
2621205 the media hub demonstrates what can be achieved thanks to the generosity of our alumni since 2003 the alumni foundation has awarded over 100 000 in grants to over 80 projects at the university we are extremely grateful for all the donations to this fund and feel a great sense of pride that our former students see the university of sheffield as an institution they wish to support well after their student days
2621206 the media hub is an excellent resource as it identifies convergence as an important part of modern day journalism it has enabled us to keep up with the technological advances being made in the newspaper industry including having an online version of the sheffield steel press and the emergence of steel tv we are extremely grateful to the university alumni whose generous donations made this all possible
2621207 the images produced are providing clinicians with functional information of the lungs that has previously been unattainable the high sensitivity of the technology means that it offers real hope for detecting lung damage early
2621208 being able to detect lung conditions and disease at an early stage could radically affect the lifespan and quality of life of patients for children with cystic fibrosis it means that with the right treatment they could live longer patients who have successfully stopped smoking can also see how they can halt or slow down the damage being done to their lungs
2621209 campaign s research team of the year award now in its sixth year is given to the team whose work has made valuable advances in breast cancer research during the past year the breadth and range of exceptional breast cancer research supported by the charity makes it more difficult to choose a winner each year
2621210 this study will pave the way for further collaborations so that more of these variants can be identified leading to a much clearer picture of the genetic pathways involved in breast cancer
2621211 we are delighted to have won the breast cancer campaign research team of the year award which is a result of a large international collaboration by the breast cancer association consortium the research conducted at sheffield is helping improve our understanding of the genetics of breast cancer which may lead us towards better treatments in the future
2621212 our findings show that carrying toddlers would have been energetically costly for our early ancestors unless they were able to devise slings or other carrying devices to make load carrying more comfortable and efficient
2621213 spring into jobs is an opportunity for students and recent graduates to ask questions in an informal environment allowing them to find out information relevant to their individual needs over 60 recruiting employers are attending the fair they are here to help identify the best candidates for their companies but also to provide information to help people determine what positions they might want to apply for
2621214 research at the dental school has increased significantly over the last five years with over 20 new members of staff the new facilities will allow us to keep the school at the forefront of international research excellence and develop further our research themes of oral disease oral biomaterials oral neuroscience and dental public health
2621215 the new wing is also designed to help us accommodate an increased number of undergraduate dental students as part of an effort to overcome the national shortage of dentists
2621216 the new wing is important in the development of the charles clifford hospital as a world class dental hospital providing specialist care to patients and clinical placements for dentists in training the research facilities will underpin our clinical activities giving patients access to the most up to date care movement of offices and management from the charles clifford to the new wing enables us to redesign and improve facilities for patients and clinical teaching in the hospital which is being refurbished at a cost of 7million with completion in 2009
2621217 our study is important because emerging infectious diseases are increasing in number cause high mortality and frequently originate from animals
2621218 our research also suggests that we are likely to see an increase in outbreaks of novel viral diseases as humans invade previously isolated habitats and these may be as likely to jump from a rat or a bat as an ape
2621219 infectious diseases crossing species barriers pose a huge and increasing threat to human health and the conservation of wild species our study helps us to understand where and how diseases jump between species and provides a critical first step in predicting future outbreaks
2621220 although i have been interviewed on radio many times i have not worked on the programme making side before this is a great opportunity to engage local communities with science engineering and technology it is all very exciting for me and a great opportunity to learn something new
2621221 we hope to show people that science is both fun and worthwhile we ll talk about anything scientific or technological from global warming to the latest science fiction movies
2621222 we are delighted to welcome professor sharkey and dr drayton to the sheffield live team and look forward to working with them on this fantastic new programme the sounds of science is an excellent addition to the ground breaking programming made by local people that we support at sheffield live
2621223 the use of nanoparticles to enhance the uptake of therapeutically armed cells by tumours could herald a new era in gene therapy one in which delivery of the gene therapy to the diseased site is much more effective this new technique could also be used to help deliver therapeutic genes in other diseases like arthritic joints or ischemic heart tissue
2621224 this exciting work could have huge implications in healthcare fundamental bioscience research may sometimes seem to have little relevance to everyday life but understanding the basic workings of the human body and harnessing nanoscale technology has resulted in a process of great potential in tumour therapy
2621225 i am delighted to have been awarded this grant and to be playing such an active part in the fight against terrorism and other illegal activity this project is an excellent example of how particle physics and astrophysics are generating techniques and expertise that can benefit the country and society and potentially save lives
2621226 i am delighted to confer this special honour on datuk zamani mohamad noor in recognition of the enormous contribution he has made to education and scholarship in malaysia
2621227 the university of sheffield is proud of its many links with malaysia in teaching and research and of its long standing partnership with mara in education and training mara sponsored students contribute greatly to the university s status as a world class institution and to the richness and diversity of life on the sheffield campus
2621228 i am delighted to be supporting this campaign which demonstrates an effective partnership between the two universities and their unions south yorkshire police and sheffield safer communities the campaign seeks to encourage students to take much greater care of their possessions to stop the rise in crime the steps we can take to counteract these incidents can be so simple yet so effective at all times we need students of sheffield to recognise that if we like it we need to lock it to keep it
2621229 sheffield benefits from a strong partnership which is dedicated to keeping sheffield s students safe whether living in halls the student village or in a residential area we need students to be vigilant with keeping their valuables and properties secure
2621230 the majority of offenders sneak into properties through insecure doors and windows and take valuables with laptops being one of the main targets for burglars we urge all students to be more safety conscious and make sure that all windows and doors are locked especially when leaving their properties
2621231 young people are three times more likely to be victims of burglary so it is especially important that our students follow the campaigns simple advice to protect their homes by taking a few straight forward precautions students can save themselves a lot of expense and heartache
2621232 the executive mba complements the university s already strong links with local organisations the management school s proven track record for teaching and learning coupled with the chance to gain two prestigious qualifications means this course is sure to provide many managers with the skills needed to develop their careers
2621233 the course was of great benefit to me and my organisation it gave me the opportunity to mix with a range of private sector people from different backgrounds the flexible structure meant that i didn t have to spend too much time away from the office and i used my dissertation as a major research project for work
2621234 this new expansion means it is now possible to search records of 197 745 individual trials running to 110 000 pages of text and some 120 million words
2621235 up until now this treasure trove of social legal and family history has only been available to a few dedicated historians who were prepared to spend months peering at microfilms
2621236 the site s use is widespread with people as far away as australia using it to trace their ancestry or find out a little more about british history without this invaluable resource these people wouldn t have access to the innumerable fascinating snapshots of individual lives contained in these trial accounts
2621237 if you want to know how to order a plate of oysters in an east end pub or what not to wear to church in islington the information is here besides the desperate drama of crimes punished the proceedings give us a new and remarkable access to the everyday
2621238 crime is something that fascinates everyone and what the old bailey proceedings does is provide people with the opportunity to see what crime was really like in the past they can make comparisons and see close parallels to what s happening today for example we think of terrorism as being new but within the old bailey proceedings people will see terrorists who are attempting to do the same things 100 years ago
2621239 outstanding effort and contribution towards the accessibility and usability of online information via their design
2621240 we are delighted to have been successful in our application for this funding this is a great boost to the trust and the university
2621241 having these two biomedical research units based in sheffield is a major coup for the city and will firmly place us at the forefront of research
2621242 so many people will benefit from these units as they will enable us to be even stronger in these areas this announcement is just the beginning this is a wonderful opportunity for the city to shine
2621243 i am delighted with the investment in cardiovascular research in sheffield this will allow us the opportunity to launch new programmes of work designed at bringing our basic research to our patients with coronary artery disease
2621244 this is welcome news which allows the university s school of medicine and biomedical sciences and the trust to build on our successful partnership in translating research into medical practice for the benefit of patients
2621245 our success in bidding for these prestigious nihr biomedical research units has been underpinned by our joint clinical research facilities and i look forward to even closer working with the trust as we develop the profile of academic medicine in sheffield
2621246 this is a fantastic coup for sheffield teaching hospitals and the university of sheffield which will put the city firmly on the research map we have an excellent ongoing relationship with the university and this is a further opportunity to extend that work for the benefit of patients in sheffield and beyond
2621247 recent research has suggested value in considering external and internal sources of workplace violence simultaneously based on these initial findings this will be the first time a single study has considered both the intra and extra organisational forms of violence and bullying
2621248 we look forward to working with a number of organisations to deliver our findings to iosh without their support we would not be able to gather the evidence that is needed to give the correct advice to those who have to deal with these difficult issues
2621249 it was my first attempt at doing a challenge so i didnt know what to expect
2621250 after covering the numerous court appearances since sharpe was first charged five months ago i feel a real sense of achievement finally being able to write up the full story of what happened to mrs pagett naming sharp was a real bonus
2621251 many companies are keen to become more environmentally friendly and save money on energy bills but are not always aware of how they can do this effectively our expertise and research in this area means that we are able to provide real solutions that are of benefit to both the company and the environment
2621252 the university s work has kick started us into thinking about our energy usage and the impact this has working with the researchers has made a big difference to the company not only to our energy bills but also to our attitudes on sustainability
2621253 the reports produced by the university were easy to understand and gave achievable recommendations before joining the university s managing directors club i had no idea that we had access to a wide range of people and services right on our doorstep all businesses in the local community should be aware of the wealth of expertise the university has to offer
2621254 i am both proud and happy to have been able to fund the dainton scholarships in memory of fred
2621255 i am delighted by the support and interest that lady dainton and her family have demonstrated by this generous donation their 100 000 endowment will ensure that we continue to award six annual dainton scholarships each of which supports a student during their undergraduate degree this is a tremendous boost to our scholarship programme
2621256 the donations are not only a great financial help but the warm wishes that come with the scholarship make me feel part of a community i am really thankful for the support and i hope that one day i can do the same for someone else
2621257 since secondary school i have wanted to teach physics i was inspired by my physics teachers and i want to be able to inspire others myself in the future i intend to pass on the opportunities i have been given in the form of both inspiration and donations back to the university so that someone else may receive the extra help i have received
2621258 these type of robots are helping mankind to take away the tedious jobs at home also the recent developments in robot surgery are hugely beneficial for all of us the da vinci robot for example can perform operations on prostate cancer patients with less scarring and damage faster than a surgeon and therefore get patients out of hospital sooner
2621259 much of this work is very useful in keeping old people out of care homes and hospitals for longer but my worry is that economic consideration could see us all spending our last year socially excluded in the company of dumb machines
2621260 this competition is a wonderful opportunity for young people to get involved in science and engineering and to learn about its principles but to have fun at the same time it is thrilling to see how enthusiastic children from both the uk and overseas are about this competition and it will encourage them to think seriously about scientific or engineering careers
2621261 architecture is a subject which affects all of us as most of our time is spent in designed spaces within an urban context
2621262 the children s enthusiasm ideas and outcomes have been astounding the exhibition designed by the children and young people involved celebrates their achievements and opens our eyes to what architecture for young people could and should be
2621263 pupils at hinde house primary engaged in an imaginative mysterious and magical approach to building design when they embarked upon their
2621264 our project was based around developing places and spaces linked to the re development of parsons cross park the project took students out of the class room and helped them develop exiting and creative ideas which generated a huge amount of interest across the school
2621265 it is an incredible honour to be asked to be part of such a tremendous association i am delighted to be among the first three non usa nurses to become part of the academy and look forward to continue working with my fellow nurse leaders from around the world in the years to come
2621266 being the first uk nurse leader to be inducted into the american academy of nursing is a fantastic achievement and one of which professor watson should be very proud this is worthwhile recognition of his hard work and determination and we are delighted that he is part of the sheffield team
2621267 this was a great initiative to be involved in as we were not only helping raise money for such a worthwhile charity but we also had lots of fun along the way
2621268 we couldn t have done it without the support of staff and students at the university who were great at organising their own charity events from raffles to sponsored walks to cake mornings
2621269 the university originally agreed to help raise 10 000 for the charity but we have far exceeded this and i would like to extend my thanks to all those staff and students who took part and helped organise activities throughout the year
2621270 the university has a responsibility to our local community and this is just one example of how staff and students have been able to give something back to the region where they live and work i am extremely proud of all those involved in making this charity appeal a huge success
2621271 understanding how to control the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into particular cell types like the beta cells that make insulin is crucial for the eventual development of treatments for diseases like diabetes these results provide an important clue as to how this may be achieved
2621272 we are delighted to be celebrating our second award in the last two months and to be getting recognition for one of our newest programmes there are more than 100 student societies at the university all with different skills and interests and we pleased to be utilising this pool of talent to help even more community groups in the region
2621273 i play the saxophone and i also do a bit of conducting the societies volunteering programme has given me a great opportunity to perform my music to a wider audience which is appreciative and receptive to my work i would definitely encourage other societies to get involved in the programme because not only is it personally rewarding but you are giving something back to the community at the same time
2621274 students from sheffield s chinese students and scholars association cssa visited our tuesday social club recently and gave a demonstration of their traditional dancing and dressed in traditional clothes they also gave some background information of the social history of their own region this was a wonderful way to generate awareness of and empathy with other cultures the event was thoroughly enjoyed by all and we would welcome and value visits from other student society groups in the future
2621275 teddy bear hospital aims to help children understand what it is like to see the doctor which allows them to combat fears and find that it s not too scary
2621276 last year sheffield teddy bear hospital had an amazing turn out it was so nice to see so many smiles on people s faces the children and teddy doctors were enjoying it equally and everyone had a great day we hope this years event is going to be bigger and better than last year with more children and their teddies enjoying the experience
2621277 tests on the toys all widely available demonstrated that most fell outside the guidelines and may certainly constitute a risk to children if the magnets become detached from the toys the most worrying finding from an injuries point of view was a jewellery set for young girls where earrings would be held in place on the ear with a pair of these magnets necrosis of the ear lobe has been reported from such use leaving permanent disfigurement and the magnets themselves are loose and very easily swallowed it is clear from our work that the current safety guidelines may not be adequate and certainly children could be at significant risk from some of these toys
2621278 the magnets used in the toys have been developed to achieve smaller lighter and more powerful motors the magnets have contributed very significantly to the green economy and are behind the development of greater energy efficiency in consumer white goods the electric motor technology in the hybrid car and such products as hand held power tools they were never designed for use in toys
2621279 back in 2000 we dealt with a flux of cases of youngsters having used tiny industrial type magnets as an alternative to body piercing around the tongue cheeks and nose
2621280 in a number of cases the children swallowed the magnets and in one case the surgical staff in the hospital dealt with a child who had suffered a perforated gut following the cases our papers on the issue were read across the world and highlighted the issue
2621281 we were pleased to be able to work with the documentary team to further raise awareness of the dangers of some toys
2621282 childwatch international recognises childhoods today as an excellent model to promote the development of young scholars and commits itself to encouraging submissions from its international network of child research institutions
2621283 through dialogue with world leading experts childhoods today brings an international dimension and fresh cultural perspectives on the work of the students it also provides more scope for interdisciplinary perspectives and aids international benchmarking of graduate training
2621284 for postgraduate students to be able test their work against peers across international boundaries is a major benefit and part of an enhanced research environment
2621285 since the award of a centre development grant by the mrc in 2004 we have already taken significant steps towards understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying a number of human disease processes the granting of mrc centre status marks an important new milestone and reinforces the university of sheffield s position as an internationally recognised centre of excellence in biomedical research
2621286 the research carried out in the centre has major implications for understanding the root causes of a range of human disorders such as parkinson s disease asthma and cardiovascular disease there is a pressing need for new therapies for these conditions and by bringing world class scientists and clinicians together under the same roof the centre aims to develop novel routes to the development of such therapies
2621287 we are always pleased to be recognised for our achievements however this latest recognition has even deeper emphasis as it is our own students who have voted in the survey
2621288 our award winning union is the focal point of the university and sits within a great city which has got a real village like atmosphere i am extremely proud to be part of such a community here at sheffield
2621289 we are all aware that sheffield has the best students union in the country but it is great to have it recognised in not one but two external rankings
2621290 the social activities for students at sheffield both at the university and within the city are second to none making it one of the best places in the uk to have a great student experience
2621291 modern metals processing is highly competitive on the international stage
2621292 we see the role of immpetus as providing a major input to uk manufacturers to ensure they remain competitive on the international stage the epsrc award is great news for both the university but also for uk metals manufacturing particularly firms in the south yorkshire region
2621293 my own firm of siemens vai is just one of several who have been with immpetus from the beginning ten years ago and the continuation is great news for us all it will keep sheffield and the uk at the top of the metals technology sector where we need to be and it proves once again that we have the whole expert spectrum here from academic to commercial all working as one team
2621294 in the manufacturing industries such as ours a partnership with institutions such as the university of sheffield where a high level of research is conducted is critical
2621295 the studies undertaken have enabled the manufacture of new spray formed products to be trialled in rolling mills and by greater understanding of roll wear microstructure and spalling existing products are working better for longer in traditional markets it is with pleasure that i praise the immpetus group in securing funding for the third successive period
2621296 this research demonstrates much of the good work that has been done by the gla as it has established itself but it also addresses the major challenges it faces as it deals with problems of worker exploitation and business fraud
2621297 the recommendations from this report provide the gla with a good starting point in order to address some of these issues and hopefully they can continue to operate successfully in what is often a difficult highly dynamic and challenging environment
2621298 we know exploitation still exists in these very competitive industries and it is our aim to stop this our thanks go to the researchers for their rigorous examination of what is one of the most important challenges facing britain today and it is a challenge that needs an industry wide effort and not simply a gla endeavour
2621299 we re absolutely thrilled that this initiative proved such a success with our students it s important to us that we offer students a variety of activities to get involved with during their stay in university accommodation and brewteam 07 has proven to be both extremely enjoyable for those involved and at the same time very educational
2621300 it s been great to work in partnership with the university of sheffield and this unique initiative has proved to be immensely popular with both the staff and students involved it s been really useful to get feedback from the student market about these two beers and about beers in general we re also really pleased that the initiative received recognition by winning a brewing business award from the society of independent brewers siba
2621301 i am delighted to be part of the marvellous team responsible for mounting this beautiful exhibition
2621302 whilst steel was clashing on steel on the battlefields of northern france copyists and painters in the french capital were quietly producing miracles of the bookmakers art it is our hope that their extraordinary work will find new admirers and fresh appreciation through this exhibition
2621303 irwin mitchell s support for pro uno will bring huge benefits for both the students they are working with and the extra local charities the scheme can now help we are extremely grateful for their support and interest in the project and look forward to expanding pro uno and building a long and successful partnership with them
2621304 we are really pleased to be working with irwin mitchell the law firm has been kind enough to offer us a full support package that will enable us to improve the quality of our research the relevance of our research and the professional standards we strive to reach in our reports
2621305 we are delighted to be working on such a worthwhile project that will benefit not only local charities and the community but will also provide local law students with the opportunity to gain some invaluable experience
2621306 this programme is just one example of our commitment to the local community and also to pro bono initiatives and we are looking forward to providing ambitious students with an insight into how a law firm operates
2621307 the partnership between irwin mitchell the university of sheffield and sheffieldvolunteering means increased benefits for all in particular the clients and the wider community benefit from the impact that can be made by the projects supporters working together
2621308 while aids has resulted in a tremendous loss of life in many parts of the world it has not led to a loss of hope rather it has prompted a diversity of creative approaches targeted at addressing this disease nowhere can this creativity be felt more strongly than in the arts the connection between arts and aids will be explored and vividly displayed through this event i hope sheffield residents come and join us
2621309 the centre is delighted to be working with the university of sheffield to celebrate and raise awareness of world aids day people are still acquiring the hiv virus unnecessarily and stigma is preventing people from accessing hiv testing and treatment the arts are an invaluable tool for raising important issues related to hiv and aids and we would encourage everyone to come along to the octagon and show their support in raising awareness for world aids day 2007
2621310 the exhibition will show off the highlights from our amazing collection of posters and ephemera with over 50 large scale framed posters and up to 300 smaller handbills on display covering music hall fairs international acts from barnum to buffalo bill strange entertainments optical and magic early cinema and circus these are the gems of the collection never before exhibited with material that hasnt been seen for over 100 years
2621311 we thought an exhibition would be the perfect way to launch our new space and give people a taster of the unique and diverse materials we have to offer our new location will make it much easier for staff students and members of the public to gain access to the archive and allow even more people to benefit from our fantastic collections
2621312 it is well recognised that transferring knowledge quickly from the research base to industry is vital to the competitiveness of uk manufacturing
2621313 the epsrc funded mantra project will enable knowledge developed within the amrc to reach many more companies
2621314 a competitive uk aerospace supply chain is crucial to the success of boeing the amrc is without doubt the most successful university based knowledge transfer organisation to have been established in recent years the degree of co operation between the industrial partners is without precedent and mantra will extend the benefits to even more uk companies
2621315 we are fortunate indeed to have an rda that backed manufacturing during some of its darkest days that foresight is now bearing fruit and manufacturing in yorkshire and the humber is looking forward to a far brighter future
2621316 our target our passion is to enthuse young people to help make good the uk deficit caused by a lost generation of engineers
2621317 we are delighted that the shared planet conference is being held in sheffield because it will be addressing the big issues that the world faces it is also fantastic that the organisers people amp planet are a student led group the conference provides an excellent opportunity for sheffield students and members of the public to become more informed on issues like global poverty and climate change and think about solutions to the world s problems
2621318 shared planet is the launch pad for student activism on these issues every year sheffield was ideal for the conference because of the ease with which the hundreds of participants from across the country can access the city and because in recent years sheffield has made significant steps in raising awareness of environmental issues
2621319 these results are important in developing plants with improved photoprotective mechanisms to enable them to better cope with climate change this may be hugely significant in our fight against global warming it is a fantastic example of what can be achieved in science when the skills of biologists and physicists are brought together
2621320 as we seek to develop new solar energy technology it will be important to not only understand but to mimic the way biology has learnt to optimise light collection in the face of the continually changing intensity of sunlight
2621321 we are really pleased to have won this award again this year the award has developed now to recognise the wide range of services and activities the union is involved in and it is always pleasing to receive some external recognition for our achievements
2621322 we ran this project for the first time at the beginning of the year and we were delighted with how many local residents and students decided to take part and the friendships that were formed during the project
2621323 this term s expanded project was yet again a great success with over70 students and local residents taking part the beauty of this project is that a lot of worthwhile jobs get done but at the same time students and local residents get to know each other and have fun
2621324 the project is a fantastic idea and it was great to see so many students turn out on the day i really enjoyed chatting to the students and i was very impressed when the university s estates team turned up with hedge trimmers and helped us neaten up the area the area looks so much tidier and attractive now
2621325 i am extremely proud to be leading an institution where staff and students actively contribute to the vibrancy and community life of the city sheffieldvolunteering is an excellent organisation and thoroughly deserves this recognition i commend all the staff and students who have given up their spare time to help out in the community they are an asset to sheffield and the university
2621326 we are thrilled to have won this award this national recognition is a wonderful achievement and we are delighted that our volunteers enthusiasm commitment and energy has been acknowledged our staff and student volunteers play a vital role in the local community and without them many community initiatives in the city wouldn t be possible
2621327 national chemistry week offers a chance for the general public and school children in particular to learn something about the excitement and diversity of chemistry and new developments that will have a major impact on everyones future the university of sheffield hosts world leading research in many areas of chemistry and is pleased once again to participate in bringing this to the public through a week long programme of activities
2621328 it is also fitting that the department of chemistry is launching its new school laboratory this week which demonstrates our dedication to getting school children enthused and interested in practical chemistry and our commitment to outreach activities
2621329 for his contribution to the venus mission simon has been given the status of full co investigator for the magnetometer instrument he is the only uk student who has this status in venus express during my involvement with numerous space missions starting with vega i have never known a student to be given this status it s a real tribute
2621330 venus has been probed many times in the early phases of planetary exploration however focus has shifted to other planets in recent years significant advances in instrumentation now allow the venusian environment to be investigated in greater detail than has been previously possible
2621331 for a phd student to be involved with such a unique problem is a fantastic opportunity the systems based approach i have learnt at the department of automatic systems and control engineering have been crucial to my success the results obtained from venus express show that venus has many interesting and exciting phenomena that have still to be studied
2621332 the construction industry is one of the uk s most wasteful by taking an unconventional approach to the design process we were forced to rethink the way in which materials can be used architects and designers have the potential to divert a lot of waste from landfill and create building and objects that are both beautiful and original
2621333 this project clearly demonstrates that something beautiful can be made from what most of us perceive as rubbish we hope that this will make other people aware that materials otherwise destined for landfill can be used to construct buildings which are low in cost and environmental impact and high in aesthetic appeal
2621334 this research provides a fresh opportunity for the british legal system as it has the potential to reduce the number of miscarriages of justice however it is important to note that at the moment this research doesn t prove that this woman is innocent instead what it clearly demonstrates is that her brain responds as if she were innocent
2621335 if proved to be accurate and these findings replicated this technology could be used alongside other factors to address questions of guilt versus innocence
2621336 the sshh campaign is an extremely positive initiative which is run by students and fully supported by the university in its third year now it recognises our students dedication to strengthening community relations and their determination to understand and respect the needs of the local community i am very proud of their efforts and look forward to supporting them in other community projects
2621337 i have worked on the sshh campaign since it was launched in 2005 and i am keen to see it grow and develop
2621338 the sshh campaign is just one of many initiatives we are planning to bring students and members of the local community closer together and we very much want to be seen as a community focused union
2621339 the sheffield safer communities partnership continues to support the sshh campaign the campaign demonstrates both the union of students and university s commitment to strengthening community relations and their commitment to reducing further the relatively low number of noise nuisance complaints we receive
2621340 the broomhill forum values and supports the continuation of the sshh campaign the sshh campaign is an excellent initiative which shows the union of students and university s commitment to working together for the good of the whole community
2621341 im pleased to show my support for the sshh campaign this is a positive step by the union of students and university to try and reduce late night noise in local neighbourhoods and help permanent residents and student residents alike get a good night s sleep
2621342 both princess katherine and theo angelopoulos are truly inspirational individuals and thoroughly deserve this recognition the university of sheffield has a long established partnership with city college and this ceremony is an important occasion to recognise the success of this partnership this success will be demonstrated at the ceremony by the hundreds of students who are to receive their degrees for their outstanding educational achievements
2621343 as an academic institution and one of the city s largest employers the university realises that we have a vital role to play in environmental issues and the fight against climate change the sheffield green bond is a fantastic scheme and we are delighted to be taking part
2621344 we are delighted to have received a 10 000 investment from the university of sheffield towards the green bond it is important to us that we have investment from local business plus the support from high profile organisations such as the university of sheffield communities will benefit from the investment and donations made so far but we really need these to increase to ensure we reach our target of 1 million
2621345 over 4 500 visitors and 100 exhibitors attended last year making the event one of the most popular careers fairs with both students and employers alike
2621346 we try to accommodate many different areas of the graduate jobs market as seen in the scope of this year s exhibitor list which includes pricewaterhousecoopers tesco the civil service the co operative group nhs graduate management training scheme hsbc and cargill as well as many other dynamic organisations offering graduate positions and placement opportunities
2621347 these free events are a fantastic way for young people to get hands on with the practical side of scientific discoveries in an easily understood way experiments help us to figure out how the world works and by coming to these sessions they ll experience them first hand
2621348 we are really excited to be working in partnership with the university it gives young people a chance to find out about science phenomena from people working at the cutting edge of their field
2621349 we have excellent treatments for osteoporosis but these are usually only given to women with low bone strength as measured by a dxa bone density scan
2621350 given that osteoporosis is a huge public health problem with significant financial costs to the nhs it makes sense to undertake an evaluation of community based screening followed by the offer of treatment to those considered at high risk of fracture a widespread and systematic screening programme could prevent fractures saving money and more importantly lives
2621351 the nos is extremely pleased to see that research into osteoporosis is becoming prioritised this study is likely to have a huge impact for those who have osteoporosis and for future generations we are delighted to offer our on going support to this project
2621352 the miller homes scheme will include two acres of green space which will be opened up to the public and will be of great benefit to local residents this amount of public open space is far larger than what is usual in residential developments
2621353 miller homes have met with local residents to define how the central arboretum area can best be maintained in the future and both the university and miller homes welcome the community s involvement in these discussions
2621354 the university has also strengthened links with the botanical gardens by offering them a number of plants from the experimental gardens so that they can continue to be enjoyed by the sheffield public we are also actively seeking a community group who can transport and reuse the old greenhouses from the site
2621355 the bluebell wood children s hospice needs constant funding in order to complete the building and to maintain it once it s finished we felt that this event was an excellent way of raising some much needed money for the charity as well as indulge our passion for swing music the evening was a great success and i hope the money we ve raised will help make many children s lives easier in the future
2621356 this research shows that cod populations have been able to survive in periods of extreme climatic change demonstrating a considerable resilience however this does not necessarily mean that cod will show the same resilience to the effects of future climatic changes due to global warming
2621357 the university s vision includes our stated aim to develop a critical mass of strategic partnerships and collaborations with world leading companies in which the process of discovery is accelerated the amrc is a wonderful example of exactly this in the five years since its development growth at the amrc has been staggering and tangible benefits have been felt in the regional and national economy with key orders won for this country and jobs secured on the basis of research led solutions which make companies more competitive
2621358 britain has proven itself to be one of the most successful locations for aerospace engineering design and manufacture in the world thanks to boeing s partnership with the university of sheffield new techniques have resulted in more energy efficient aircraft we are also using composite materials to push the boundaries of new materials vital to the next generation of aerospace such cutting edge developments are the result of a collaboration which develops skills and creates wealth and intellectual property for us as a company for the university and for the benefit of uk industry

2621360 the molecules dissolve in water so they can be made available in an easy to ingest liquid form that quickly passes into the bloodstream
2621361 as well as making it simple to control how much co is introduced into a patient s body it will be possible to refine the design of the molecules so that they target a particular place while leaving the rest of the body unaffected
2621362 this project provides an excellent example of how non biological sciences like chemistry can underpin important advances in healthcare
2621363 the lowry s myth of the north exhibition has tried to capture the character and spirit of the north through art and culture the result being a vast cross section of exhibits that reflect the sheer diversity of the region
2621364 however there is a tangible social and economic distinction between north and south informed by various yardsticks life expectancy and house prices are useful statistical indicators whilst noticeable changes in architecture and road networks provide more physical boundaries these types of measures combined with attitudal evidence such as voting patterns help us to map where the dividing line lies but as these change so can the boundary
2621365 it s great that all our dedication and hard work has been recognised we are delighted that one of us is in with a chance of winning the category but we are also thrilled at the prospect of winning the much coveted business of the year prize we are both very much looking forward to the event in october
2621366 this is a wonderful opportunity for our students to practice their chinese and meet students from a chinese university the students have worked tirelessly to prepare themselves for the debate and i am extremely proud of them it would be fantastic for them to make it to beijing and represent the uk but at the moment they are just concentrating on this week s performance
2621367 the fact that sheffield was one of only five uk universities chosen to take part in the competition demonstrates the strength of chinese studies at the university i look forward to welcoming the cctv film crew and the chinese students to the university and i wish our students the best of luck in the debate
2621368 this competition is a great opportunity for me and my fellow team mates to improve our chinese skills in both speaking and listening our preparation with chinese students studying locally has given us a real insight into what it is like to debate with native speakers of chinese and has given us the chance to make new friends going to beijing would be an excellent way to top off the whole experience

2621371 we are delighted to be welcoming the duke of kent to the university and to be able to demonstrate the world class research and enterprise that takes place at sheffield we are privileged to have some extremely talented academics and students here at sheffield who take part in innovative and exciting projects and it will be a great pleasure for me to introduce them to the duke
2621372 genocide has been the scourge of the 20th century and it will almost certainly haunt humankind in the 21st century when scarcity of resources and climate change will increase the likelihood of genocidal violence
2621373 by establishing and supporting its centre for the study of genocide and mass violence the university of sheffield creates a unique institution that bridges the gap not only between various disciplines but also between academia politics and the third sector
2621374 the centre is unique in this country its work which transcends disciplinary boundaries has international significance not just in the analysis of past genocides but in alerting to conditions in parts of the world which may be conducive to genocidal actions in the future it is excellent that the university of sheffield has committed itself to support this important centre

2621380 the focus of cancer treatment is gradually changing from cure or failure to living with cancer as a chronic illness the balance between prolonged life and quality of life has never been so important
2621381 quality of life is crucial for cancer patients it is important that we can carry on with our lives with some sort of normality and feel as well as possible for as long as possible
2621382 what does quality of life mean to you the definition and measurement of quality of life is something that has been the focus of debate for many years this conference will give patients and carers a chance to put their views to the professional researchers please come along and make your views known
2621383 quality or quantity of life how research helps find the balance
2621384 there is evidence from many species that sons are more costly for mothers to give birth to and care for than daughters it now appears that after producing a son a mother may be less able to invest in her next child this reduced investment may compromise the early development of the body s physiological systems including those important for reproduction
2621385 this fair is one of the most popular events in our calendar with over 1 700 visitors attending in 2006 more and more students now work during their studies and we have tried to incorporate as many different employers offering as wide a variety of jobs as possible
2621386 exhibitors at this year s event range from private sector employers through to charities and voluntary organisations offering paid and voluntary vacancies during term time and vacation periods

2621409 after seeing first hand the great work of the school i was keen to be able to contribute in some way organising this event was a fun and simple way of raising much needed funds as well as getting out into the beautiful countryside of the peak district the letters we all received from the girls out in uganda were a lovely motivation and confirmed to us that the money we raise will be going to an extremely worth while cause
2621410 we are short of words to describe how much we appreciate women from another part of the world coming together to celebrate their solidarity for the girls in our school the name of the valley may not be a coincidence at urdt we believe that hope vision and a learning attitude are key to the development of the rural poor in africa we also believe that in particular women play a key role in getting africa out of the poverty trap
2621411 i am extremely moved and honoured to have received these prestigious awards from the bsg and the spa to be recognised by one s peers is a very special experience for a scientist but to have an award made in my name and to be celebrated for my contributions to social policy and social gerontology is deeply humbling i intend to work hard to continue to live up to these accolades
2621412 it was with great pleasure that the executive committee and members of the bsg acknowledged the contribution of professor alan walker to writing and research on ageing not only has his work been nationally and internationally acclaimed he has inspired students and colleagues from a wide range of backgrounds and professions to pursue the study of later life we felt it fitting that a prize in his name should be awarded annually to a member of the bsg who has made a major contribution to gerontology
2621413 computer based modelling is a great way of allowing scientists to test observations in nature and find scientific explanations by using state of the art modelling techniques ranging from large networks of simulated brain cells through to models of individuals this type of research could lead to a greater understanding of brain disorders such as parkinsons disease and attention deficit disorder
2621414 at university students have to think a lot more for themselves i hope to bring back to the school not only improved links but improved knowledge of what university admission tutors look for lots of people on both sides think they know what the other side wants but i m hoping this project can actually bridge the gap
2621415 our method of plutonium disposal is surprisingly simple recent advancements in drilling technology have meant that we can now go much deeper into the earth s crust to dispose of nuclear waste using these deep boreholes we at the university have created a method of safely encapsulating plutonium before burying it and disposing of it completely
2621416 the reunion is a fantastic opportunity for our alumni to return to the university and see how much it s changed in recent years it will also be a chance for old friends to meet up again and to share fond memories of their student days
2621417 i look forward to welcoming our alumni back to the university we are extremely proud of our graduates and this event will be an excellent chance to hear all about the great things they have achieved in life since being students
2621418 this scheme is a great opportunity for students to gain a university of sheffield degree without immediate commitment to full time study it may particularly suit those people already working in laboratory or analytical jobs whose career progression would be enhanced by having a degree
2621419 students who join the scheme will begin by studying at home with support from ou tutors and this means students can study when and where it suits them we expect many students will be in full time or part time work while they study with the ou
2621420 this is an exciting new way to get a physics or chemistry degree the flexibility of study together with the excellent courses offered by the ou and its partner universities represents an excellent opportunity to offer the considerable benefits of an education in the physical sciences to a broader range of students
2621421 i am delighted that we have won the busa badminton shield the shield and our status at the top of our league is testament to the hard work and commitment of all the team members and the support of our coaches and the staff at u sport i can t wait to start next season in the higher division and see if we can continue to succeed at a higher level
2621422 at u sport we are very keen to support and offer guidance to the university s sporting teams and ensure they have the facilities and coaching staff available to achieve the best possible results
2621423 i watched the university s women s badminton team in action at the final in sheffield and was very impressed with their skills and determination everyone at u sport is extremely proud of them and i wish them every success next season in their new league
2621424 this index will enable us to place climatic phenomena such as the north atlantic oscillation and el nino southern oscillation enso in a broader perspective of global environmental change it will also help assess the significance of recent variations in storminess over the uk for example
2621425 this index will give scientists a better understanding of the bigger picture facing climate change and global warming
2621426 this week is really important for us it is a good opportunity to raise awareness of the bone marrow register and to recruit more volunteers who could potentially end up saving someone s life bone marrow awareness week is also our best opportunity throughout the year to raise money so that we can continue to contribute to the anthony nolan trust i really encourage students and members of the public alike to come down to the fundraising events and help with the continuation of marrow s good work
2621427 securing the support of the university of sheffield is extremely important for the anthony nolan trust without support from groups such as this we would not be able to continue to recruit lifesaving donors the platform this relationship will give us to raise both funds and awareness is very exciting we are also absolutely delighted to have this support from the university of sheffield
2621428 we are delighted to have won this prestigious award which recognises our commitment to supporting the research momentum and career progression of women alongside their family responsibilities
2621429 the university of sheffield is committed to recruiting and retaining high calibre female staff this initiative is part of our ongoing action to address gender equality issues which are faced by female academic colleagues
2621430 great minds think differently to thrive and be successful businesses need diversity identikit people with identikit views and experiences do not add value or aid creativity and innovation the university of sheffield s warp initiative is an excellent example of an employer creating a diverse workplace where women can achieve their full potential if more employers followed the lead of the university of sheffield and the other award winners their businesses their staff and the uk economy could benefit immensely
2621431 observing acoustic waves in the solar atmosphere helps us to understand and determine its physical nature the solar atmosphere is extremely dynamic and is very hot and temperatures can sometimes reach a few thousand times of that of the surface probing the solar plasma by acoustic waves has great importance in fusion reactor research as nuclear fusion in tokamaks is perhaps the solution to ease the human hunger for green energy in the 21st century
2621432 i think that the female waterfowl have evolved these unique anatomical features as physical counter measures to evade male attempts to assert control over reproduction
2621433 in response to male attempts to force their paternity on females female waterfowl may be able to assert their own behavioural and anatomical means of controlling who fathers their offspring
2621434 we speculate that these physical barriers are easily overcome when females cooperate during copulation and that they only function to exclude unwanted advances
2621435 this is a great opportunity for people in sheffield to hear the diverse range of music that is available in the city there has been much negativity about asylum seekers and i am extremely proud to be involved in a project that celebrates the positive influence immigrants can have in their local communities
2621436 asylum seekers and other migrants face huge challenges in not only getting to this country but in forming a new life in a new environment by organising this concert i wanted to do something to allow the richness of asylum seekers musical talent and experiences to be heard we have gathered together a group of excellent performers who deserve public exposure and whose work shows the range of talent of those looking for a new and safe place to live in sheffield

2621438 faith matters week will also coincide with and complement the university s excellence through inclusion week a human resources initiative which aims to encourage equality inclusion and diversity
2621439 faith matters week is an excellent opportunity through presentations discussion and social events to raise questions and have conversations about different approaches to faith and spirituality the week is about exploration and information and is not designed to be prescriptive or pressurising in any way whilst not diminishing the real challenges that lie between people of different faith it constructively allows various faiths to work and discuss together

2621441 the launch of the centre for health and social care studies and service development is a significant milestone in the life of the school of nursing and midwifery
2621442 through various partnerships we will develop opportunities for professionals to work and learn together crossing traditional boundaries this is particularly important at a time when the delivery of health and social care is undergoing major change we need to be at the forefront of developments and through the centre we will produce professionals who can work in new ways and in new roles
2621443 the information commons looks even more impressive in reality than it did in the artists impressions our architects rmjm have done a terrific job as well as being an architectural icon the university has a building that will provide an excellent learning resource for our staff and students combining high quality student focused study space with extensive print and digital learning resources

2621447 teddy bear hospital is also a really great learning activity for kids as well as role playing a visit to the doctor with their teddy they can take part in games to learn about healthy eating and how the body works
2621448 through working in close partnership with the carbon trust on their higher education carbon management programme we can develop a strategy and a set of practical actions to help us be more energy efficient we are looking forward to reducing our carbon emissions and therefore playing our role in the fight against climate change while securing considerable financial savings as well

2621454 the school values the diversity of applicants to all of its dental programmes and has been determined to encourage the widest access to all suitable candidates
2621455 the adopt scheme is an innovative initiative that encourages teenagers from all backgrounds to consider applying for a career in dentistry and therefore expands the range of potential applicants i am extremely proud of the staff who have worked to set up this scheme and wish it every success
2621456 this initiative is an excellent opportunity for our students who are considering a career in dentistry to get help and advice from the experts the university of sheffield is a wonderful local resource of expertise and facilities and i am delighted that our pupils will benefit from this
2621457 the department is already recognised internationally for its research excellence and we are extremely pleased to be improving and developing our facilities further
2621458 this new facility will not only improve the university s capability for world class research but it will also enhance sheffield s reputation for addressing global environmental issues a topic high on the agenda
2621459 sheffield with its green attributes and natural and industrial sites of scientific interest is an ideal place to carry out extensive ecological research the new facilities will enable both the city and the university to be placed at the forefront of global environmental issues

2621464 weve been fortunate enough to host the salters festival here at the university of sheffield for a number of years there is always a good uptake from local schools and the students really get engaged with the hands on science and chemistry that they do exposing these students to this practical element is really vital in enthusing them about science
2621465 the potential of assistive technologies for improving the lives of older people is immense but there are a bewildering number of products and not all are good value the act programme will do all it can to raise the quality and flow of information about what works
2621466 this programme gives clinicians and academics the opportunity to work with industry to develop better technology and technology supported services for the benefit of older and disabled people it also gives an important boost to businesses in south yorkshire helping them stay ahead in this fast growing market by producing innovative globally competitive products and services
2621467 south yorkshire has one of the largest clusters of medical device manufacturers in the uk with 8 of all uk companies however the region s businesses lag behind the rest of europe in terms of research and development investment which holds back the region s economic renewal the new programme will stimulate the assistive technology and telecare industry in south yorkshire and help to establish it as a lead region in products and expertise
2621468 we are delighted that pure energy has yet again chosen the university of sheffield to host this exciting and educational event
2621469 this is a unique opportunity for fitness instructors in the region to get together at a local venue to discuss good practice and take inspiration from leading instructors

2621471 the event will be a great opportunity for fitness instructors to take part in an array of innovative fitness classes and get inspiration for their own classes this in turn will hopefully lead to more varied and exciting fitness classes for members of the public
2621472 our research shows that drinking green tea could reduce the risk of becoming infected by hiv and could also slow down the spread of hiv
2621473 it is not a cure and nor is it a safe way to avoid infection however we suggest that it should be used in combination with conventional medicines to improve quality of life for those infected future research is also currently under way in order to determine how much effect can be expected from different amounts of tea
2621474 state of the nation unionism and the alternatives in the united kingdom since 1707
2621475 my colleagues and i in the department of politics are delighted at the news of these awards and we proud of the achievements of our colleagues three of these prizes have been given to lecturers who have been appointed since 2003 and all of them provide external recognition of the calibre of the research and teaching conducted within the department
2621476 the achievement of sheffield politics staff in scooping four of the annual prizes of the political studies association psa is remarkable in the 57 year history of the psa it is unprecedented for one department to secure so many awards in a single year what makes sheffield s triumph even more laudable is that competition for prizes was perhaps the strongest in recent memory across all categories
2621477 on behalf of the psa i wish to offer congratulations to the staff of the politics department at sheffield for their tremendous achievements
2621478 it is very exciting to be able to transform the university s arts tower into a huge piece of public art and at the same time be able to raise awareness for such a great cause
2621479 we are delighted to be helping students at the university of sheffield and the national charity marie curie cancer care this is such a worthwhile campaign and we hope the huge daffodil will have a striking impact in the city and beyond
2621480 we re so grateful for this fantastic support from the university of sheffield we all can t wait to see the giant daffodil towering over the city
2621481 each of these treatments can have complications and unwanted side effects research is therefore crucial to build knowledge and reduce uncertainty to help inform and support patients future treatment choices
2621482 the results of the trial should help to inform future uk screening policy and guidance to the nhs reducing variation in practice
2621483 after having the most amazing adventure last year meeting some excellent people and having the satisfaction of being part of an event that raised 55 000 i decided i wanted to be more involved little did i know i would end up being chair
2621484 im really looking forward to seeing everyones hard work pay off this year and hopefully raising even more money for some well deserved charities
2621485 this is the second year we have run this event in partnership with input and yet again it has been a brilliant success it is great to see the children getting so excited and enthusiastic about the challenge and taking real pride in their models many young people view engineering as working on car engines and do not realise the diversity within the subject these open days are vital for their understanding and gives them the opportunity to visit a university and learn more about what higher education has to offer them
2621486 it was a superb day excellently organised giving pupils a great insight into engineering
2621487 we are delighted that so many students have successfully completed the award and that their teachers and families were at last night s ceremony to celebrate their achievements the awards promote excellence in achievement and attainment and all the students their families and teachers who attended last night s award ceremony must be congratulated on their success in working together to achieve this outcome
2621488 i think the university s achievement award scheme is an excellent initiative which motivates our students to succeed and gives them a certificate they can show employers when applying for jobs our school has been involved with the award for several years and throughout this time we have had an average of 70 success rate of students who meet the criteria one of the great things about the award is the fact that anybody in the year group can achieve it it is reliant on students doing the right thing whatever their academic capability
2621489 the university s achievement award scheme has given me a real incentive to complete all my coursework and keep my attendance and punctuality at a high standard it also gives me something additional for my cv which will hopefully be valued by employers
2621490 robot technology is accelerating with applications in the home in the workplace and in the military it is hard to keep up and we are at a point where the public need to make some informed decisions about our future
2621491 some researchers believe that robots will have consciousness on a timescale of 50 plus years while others believe this is still a fairytale the problem is that robots may be required to make decisions that could affect our lives much sooner while some governments are beginning to draw up ethical guidelines we need to initiate proper public consultation and informed public debate now
2621492 dr roberts research has opened the door to endless opportunities for future discoveries in the world of science the university is pleased to have been able to organise the visit of such an eminent scientist and one of our most famous alumni to malaysia he will hopefully inspire the future generation of malaysian students and young scientists
2621493 the university is proud to celebrate with malaysia its 50th anniversary of independence and we look forward to continuing to work with the people of malaysia in the years ahead
2621494 the crf provides a dedicated unit in which to offer the highest standard of research expertise to investigators from the development of a protocol through to gaining ethics and governance approval to completion of the project with high quality data the spacious and well equipped facility along with our highly trained and experienced research team enables us to offer excellent nursing and medical care to the healthy volunteers and patients who participate in the research studies
2621495 we were delighted to welcome nick clegg to the hospital to perform the official opening ceremony and to be able to show him the excellent facilities at the crf the crf is at the heart of new developments in clinical research and has confirmed sheffield s place in the crf network the facility is part of a 26 million investment to provide state of the art research infrastructure in the university s school of medicine and biomedical sciences
2621496 it is important that we do not stand still and that we keep moving forward to continue improving services for patients the crf is a major step forward for us and demonstrates how the partnership between the trust and the university works exceptionally well to help us to achieve this
2621497 the teams have both been working incredibly hard for the past six weeks and i am looking forward to seeing all their efforts come to fruition in the competition not only have they built fantastic robots but they have created websites and made t shirts for the competition i am very proud to be associated with the teams and i am sure it has increased their enthusiasm for science and technology in general
2621498 we are extremely grateful to ben for all his support over the last few weeks he has taught the team many skills from coming up with initial ideas for the robot to computer programming i am looking forward to competition and hope we gain a place in the final
2621499 this competition has been an excellent opportunity for our pupils to learn about robotics and to learn some valuable skills from ben the children are all very excited about travelling to america and competing against other teams of children from around the world
2621500 although the new pitches are not expected to be completed until mid april community clubs and 5 a side teams are already showing a great deal of interest i would encourage any local club looking to enter a league or secure a training slot to contact us as soon as possible
2621501 the pitches are part of u sport s commitment to continue to improve sports facilities enhance related services and widen participation in physical activity
2621502 homelessness organisations know that rehousing homeless people is far more complex than simply providing a roof over someone s head this new study will aim to establish the factors associated with the outcomes of resettlement it will help the homelessness organisations understand what makes some people abandon their tenancies or be evicted and will prove a vital tool in preventing homelessness
2621503 we are determined to deliver the evidence that will enable the organisations to provide more effective resettlement if the success rate of resettlement is increased lives will be improved and there will be significant savings in supporting those who return to homelessness
2621504 verbal abuse is distressing and may have longer term implications for both employee health and turnover it is also important to note that in other nhs contexts verbal abuse can escalate to physical violence it is vital that we conduct more research in the nhs to understand how staff can intervene effectively and safely once a person has started to be verbally abusive
2621505 ambulance control staff do much more than dispatching ambulances they are also required to ask questions over the phone to help the patient stay alive it is imperative that the general public understands how the 999 service operates in regards to the ambulance service in order for nhs staff to do this extremely important job without fear of abuse
2621506 hospital trusts should address the key issues of nursing sickness medical leadership and how patient care is delivered if there are to improve performance moves to nationally reorganise emergency services with the closure of a amp e departments seeing smaller numbers of patients and the development of super a amp e departments may have an adverse effect on the length of time patients wait to see a doctor
2621507 in addition changes to junior doctor training which will produce consultants earlier must ensure junior doctors are equipped with appropriate management skills to lead nhs services
2621508 i am pleased to welcome sir john to the university for this lecture he has enjoyed a varied and influential career and i am certain his lecture will be an extremely informative discussion about the risks we all take in everyday life
2621509 i am delighted to have this opportunity to return to my home city of sheffield and to talk about the question of risk and responsibility is it up to us to make our own choices or should the state play a helping hand i will refer to examples such as obesity smoking and drinking
2621510 we operate within a global market and recognise the substantial talent and dedication of young people in india the scholarship programme will provide a very exciting opportunity for the department of biomedical science to build much stronger collaborative links with india and should bring substantial mutual benefits in both teaching and research
2621511 this scholarship is to acknowledge the traditionally strong relationship between india and the university of sheffield it also recognises the very important contribution indian students make to university life
2621512 we look forward to welcoming the winning student to the university and i am sure that they will make an excellent addition to our student body
2621513 we re really pleased to be forging this link with uk universities through the scholar hunt our aim is to mix academic excellence and the competitive spirit to create an intelligent thought provoking show the airtel scholar hunt will tap into the growing aspiration among indians to study overseas and will be exactly the kind of programme that suits ndtv s well informed audience modern aspiring indians with an expanded world view and the ambition to make the most of their lives
2621514 this programme will be beneficial to both our students and the south yorkshire children taking part in the workshops our students have received training from young enterprise and have developed their interpersonal skills while improving their presentation techniques this programme allows our students to make a real difference to childrens education and give them the skills needed for the world of work
2621515 this is our second year working in partnership with sheffield sife and i am absolutely delighted to have the help and support of such committed and hard working young people helping other young people develop their enterprise capability i am sure the pupils involved in the programme will benefit enormously and that they will inspire and encourage other schools across south yorkshire to participate
2621516 we hope our efforts will raise awareness about the discrimination against lgbt individuals that still persists in many parts of the world as well as giving people the opportunity to learn more about the committee and our activities
2621517 i hope this will be a very informative week that will highlight the issues faced by lgbt people around the world the student movement led british society towards acceptance of lgbt people and hopefully it can be at the forefront of achieving the same worldwide
2621518 it s a wonderful honour to have received this award and i m pleased that the team s excellent work has been recognised
2621519 the ukraine is a fascinating country which is going through an incredible amount of development i have been amazed by the passion of the healthcare professionals for their work in spite of wide spread stigmatisation of children with disabilities
2621520 i am very proud of jill s achievement it is justly deserved not only has jill has put her own time and effort into this work but she has also motivated students from the school of nursing and midwifery to become involved in this very worthwhile project
2621521 mobile technology has become indispensable to the majority of people in this society therefore it was interesting to see how much people value natural environments compared to the convenience of modern technology
2621522 the public s high level of sensitivity to incremental landscape change revealed through this research can be encouraging news for conservation organisations in their efforts to conserve landscapes from increasing development pressures
2621523 this is not to suggest however that telecommunications development should be stopped in the national parks the research also indicates that national parks in england are lived in landscapes and therefore local communities and visitors also need the convenience of modern technology
2621524 we are living in a noisy world where threats to hearing are increasing particularly amongst young people
2621525 we hope that the show will also help people understand what researchers are doing to develop new technologies and medical treatments for deafness and the great potential that exists to find cures
2621526 our conclusion is that britain is becoming increasingly segregated across all ages by class education occupation home ownership health status disability and family type there is much more to identity in britain than identities of religion and ethnicity mapping at different ages shows ever more clearly that where you live can limit or assist your life chances from the cradle to the grave
2621527 most people think they are average when asked in most things most are not most say they are normal but our atlas shows that what is normal changes rapidly as you travel across the social topography of human identity in britain from the fertile crescent of advantage where to succeed is to do nothing out of the ordinary to the peaks of despair where to just get by is extraordinary
2621528 student recruitment in science engineering and technology has been falling year upon year for the last 10 years and a lot of this has to do with science s image
2621529 in india and china when i ask groups of teenagers who wants to be a scientist or engineer there is a sea of hands with kids jumping up and down the same question to british teenagers gets a couple of hands and the rest snigger at them this is very worrying for our future the aim of bright sparks is to turn this negative opinion around and get more people interested in science
2621530 this is the first time a study has shown that in mammal species the system is driven by females using very simple rules to avoid breeding incestuously
2621531 the results of the study were only possible because we were able to monitor the decisions made by male hyenas in all eight resident hyena groups on the floor of the ngorongoro crater through this research we could genetically determine paternity for most offspring produced in a 10 year monitoring period
2621532 decisions regarding reconfiguration of acute services are complex and require consideration of many conflicting factors our data suggests that any changes that increase journey distances to hospital for all emergency patients may lead to an increase in mortality for some
2621533 patients who are in anaphylactic shock choking drowning or having an acute asthma attack need urgent care that would be the same wherever it is provided it is likely that these patients would survive by travelling a short distance to a local a amp e department rather than travelling a long distance to a specialist hospital
2621534 while universities can play an important role they are often supported by a system of publicly funded research institutes and laboratories dedicated to applied research much of which has commercial potential
2621535 wales has no such research infrastructure with many of the uk s public research institutes based in the southern regions of the uk which by no coincidence are also the most economically competitive
2621536 if wales is to use its political autonomy in the most appropriate and considered manner it should seriously consider the feasibility of establishing a series of publicly funded research institutes that best reflect the future direction of the regional economy
2621537 as the knowledge required to produce innovations becomes more specialised and located in new locations around the world companies are having to ensure that they are closely linked and aligned with these new sources wherever they may be since china is now the second highest research spender it is increasingly likely that it will feature more prominently as one of these new sources
2621538 since labour came into power in 1997 there has been an increased dependence on public sector employment this has had a huge impact on promoting entrepreneurship individuals weigh up the risks and rewards associated with wage employment and business ownership with increased levels of public sector employment available individuals may be less inclined to take entrepreneurial risks and choose relatively secure wage employment however despite the obviously important role played by the public sector it is still largely the private sector that creates value and is the engine of growth and economic development
2621539 if policies are adapted to address these issues and more support is given to entrepreneurs the uk can move towards a truly dynamic modern and growing knowledge based economy which boosts productivity and creates employment and prosperity
2621540 we are very excited to be part of this project it is the first comparative study of its kind that will look at these three parliaments it will explore how the ceremonies and rituals that are an integral part of the operation of each institution help to shape democratic practices and the extent to which these democracies are fully inclusive
2621541 we are delighted that these three individuals have been acknowledged for their academic achievements through these fellowships each one is a leader in their field all with the capability to set the global research agenda and be at the forefront of academic discovery they are an asset to the university and we are extremely proud of them
2621542 we have carried out previous research on the benefits of grandmothers but we wanted to get the full picture by looking at grandfathers as well the results suggest the long lifespan in human men has not benefited their adult offspring s reproductive success even though grandfathers are much valued today it is thus more likely that longevity in men is related to their ability to have their own offspring even at advanced ages
2621543 this new theory has its roots in ideas proposed by james baldwin in 1896 who made the counter intuitive argument that learning within each generation could guide evolution of innate behaviour over future generations baldwin was right but in ways more subtle than he could have imagined because concepts such as artificial neural networks and distributed representations were not known in his time
2621544 there are many interesting and diverse natural spaces in our towns and cities which are often ignored some of them are managed and some of them left to fend for themselves some are used by the local community while others become a home for rubbish or anti social behaviour we hope this conference and our project will go some way to suggesting that all these spaces are significant and need careful consideration particularly in areas of mass regeneration where there is a tendency to remove or overly manage the sites
2621545 the university of sheffield has been taking the study of urban wildscapes seriously for more than 30 years now that there is such interest in the value of all kinds of urban greenspace for the important role it plays in successful regeneration it is particularly appropriate to see national and international experts gathering in the city
2621546 we are delighted to have been given the go ahead to develop this site and create an innovative state of the art building for the university s department of music this is the latest in a series of exciting developments for the university and demonstrates our commitment to providing excellent facilities for our students at the same time as developing and regenerating key areas of the city
2621547 there are several advantages to this mechanism it is strong as good as epoxy glue but reversible in the fact that it can be turned off and still be re used it is also water based and so environmentally friendly
2621548 trying to identify where this will be used at this point is difficult as scientists we have contributed what you might call the molecular tools of nanotechnology with our adhesive but it is up to the engineers to decide how to use it drug delivery is always a possibility because different parts of the body have different ph values a possibility is that the body s natural ph could be used with the adhesive to allow drug release
2621549 we are very excited by these results and believe this technology will bring significant benefit to patients children and adults with growth hormone deficiency have to give themselves daily injections and it is hoped that the new technology will reduce the number of times they have to do this to once every two weeks or even once a month
2621550 although we are only in the early stages of the drug development process and any drugs resulting from this research are several years away from approval it s wonderful to see the science translate from the computer screen to what we hope will be real benefits for patients
2621551 we believe that the technology can also be applied to treat inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis cancer and metabolic diseases
2621552 despite common funding through the 6th and 7th framework of the european commission current legislation means that scientists within europe cannot freely exchange personnel and cell lines
2621553 this has huge consequences for stem cell research in europe limiting the ability of researchers with different expertise in different countries to work together for the common good
2621554 eurostemcell scientists from across europe are working together to compare embryonic and tissue stem cells and their potential for medical applications however the situations in germany and italy present constant difficulties because our colleagues in these countries may be punished for taking part in research activities of the project
2621555 our clinical placement outreach programme is an award winning quality project that brings major benefits to both our student dentists and the local population we are delighted that the president of the general dental council is able to come up to sheffield to see for himself how modern dental education is improved by this type of outstanding learning experience
2621556 we really enjoy hosting students and they make tremendous progress in their six weeks with us the feedback from patients students and staff has been extremely positive
2621557 as the uk dental regulator one of the general dental council s most important roles is setting educational standards we encourage dental course providers to be innovative with their programmes outreach is an exciting and demanding development for dental schools and the university of sheffield has been at the forefront of this i look forward to visiting the school and seeing the students working in the community
2621558 we developed parrotwatch to raise awareness and funds for the work that we are doing
2621559 we hope to make local people realise that allowing the chicks to remain in their nests and join the wild population is important and that they shouldn t take the chicks from their nests at the same time we want people around the world to learn more about these incredible birds and understand why poaching these parrots can have a devastating effect on their survival in the wild
2621560 the aim of our research here on bonaire is to find out what is limiting the growth of the amazon parrot population we are collecting data on everything from the choice of nest site and the level of parental care to the differences in chick survival in the various island habitats parrotwatch ties in well with this work helping us answer important questions raise money for conservation and educate the general public
2621561 it is a huge personal honour to be elected to a fellowship one knows the process of selection is independent and rigorous i think it is also a tribute to the research support provided by the university of sheffield and i am very grateful for that
2621562 election to fellowship is the principal way in which the academy recognises scholarly excellence this year we are pleased to welcome new fellows from all of the disciplines represented in the academy displaying a variety of cutting edge specialisms from mediaeval art to game theory from islamic history to philosophy of physics from ethnomusicology to the economic analysis of law
2621563 nanotechnology responsibly developed could help meet a number of society s pressing needs in areas of sustainable energy and medicine i am now looking forward to working with the epsrc and the research community to ensure that the uk is at the forefront of the global competition to develop exciting science and valuable applications in nanotechnology
2621564 science and engineering week in south yorkshire is the largest regional programme in the uk with such a fascinating and broad mix of activities well be able to provide something of interest for everyone
2621565 it is a great testimony to the people of south yorkshire that such a successful event takes place and it shows our commitment to promoting science engineering technology and maths
2621566 it is fitting that this important event is taking place at the university of sheffield which was voted one of the top 50 companies in the country that women want to work for the university is committed to promoting gender equality and i am pleased to be involved with this event it is vital that everyone works towards eliminating gender inequalities
2621567 i m very proud that the university of sheffield s union of students is hosting this event it will help inspire and inform women and men of different generations about the issues affecting women today
2621568 fem 07 is an important part of a newly emerging movement in which young women and men are coming forward to stand up against the inequality of women and are proud to call themselves feminists fem 07 offers a fantastic opportunity to find out more about the issues and how to make a difference
2621569 the project is a great example of progress that can be achieved at the life sciences physical sciences interface and we hope the project will deliver technology of real importance
2621570 varsity is a festival of sport providing opportunities for students from across sheffield to get involved with sporting activities and make use of the city s fantastic sporting facilities it also gives local people the opportunity to watch and learn about an array of different sports and show people how fun and exciting sport can be
2621571 varsity is an amazing opportunity to get across the benefit and importance of student sport not just to our students but also the city of sheffield as a whole it is a positive event and we want as many people as possible to get into the spirit of varsity and make it a fantastic event and platform to perform on
2621572 winter varsity is a great opportunity for students in sheffield to take advantage of the excellent sporting facilities the city has to offer and get involved in sporting activities that aren t always possible in other parts of the uk it is also a great opportunity for both children and adults in the local community to come together and watch some exciting sporting events
2621573 sheffield hallam university has numerous students that excel in winter sports so the competition is a chance to showcase these achievements and promote winter sports it promises to be a fantastic showcase that shouldnt be missed
2621574 this research fellowship is a wonderful opportunity for me and tom to build on the research we have already completed in the uk and increase our knowledge and expertise in the area of terrorism
2621575 the exchange scheme with pennsylvania state university will put andrew and tom at the heart of the study of terrorism and international security in the united states the chance for sheffield students to study at a leading us centre is an exciting development for both universities and will i know lead to great opportunities
2621576 the technique has revolutionary implications for x ray imaging of individual atoms in any structure the key development is that we can now use a computer to calculate the phase of the high resolution data something which could never be seen by the lens alone
2621577 it is even possible to contemplate a solid state optical microscope built into a single chip with no optical elements at all all the weakness difficulties and costs of lenses would be therefore replaced by a combination of good quality detectors and computers
2621578 our ultimate aim is to be able to take high resolution 3d images of any molecular structure using the ultimate x ray or electron microscope
2621579 i am proud of the university s reputation of excellence in the teaching of czech and i welcome ambassador winkler his visit will be an important opportunity to demonstrate the unique research links the university has with czech institutions and to demonstrate the plans we have for the future
2621580 were looking forward to showing the ambassador and the cultural attach how czech studies has developed at sheffield over the last few years and what our plans are for the future the embassy has been tremendously supportive of czech programmes across the uk in recent years a visit like this is important recognition for all the members of staff who work in the field here and is a real boost for the students for them its satisfying to know that the czechs take an interest in the fact that they are studying this language
2621581 this is the biggest just do it event we have ever seen the number of students getting involved in the project has yet again increased and with the introduction of staff volunteers we are able to help even more community groups and organisations across the city
2621582 i am extremely grateful to all the staff and student volunteers who have decided to get involved and who are making positive contribution to the city in which they work and study
2621583 my team has always admired the enthusiasm and commitment of student volunteers we have always been keen to get involved with volunteering
2621584 the just do it weekend will be the perfect opportunity for us to volunteer and make a positive contribution in the local community
2621585 it is with great pleasure that we welcome sir crispin to the university for this lecture his work on climate change has brought him international respect and we are deeply honoured to stage such a prestigious lecture on such a topical and thought provoking issue
2621586 climate change has been described as the biggest threat mankind has faced in the modern age and my lecture aims to discuss what that threat is and how it can be avoided i am looking forward to visiting the university of sheffield an institution with a proven track record in climate change research
2621587 the meeting will focus on selected aspects of sorbys diverse work and show how his work influenced important branches of scientific study the meeting will also discuss how the techniques he pioneered and the questions he raised continue to be important i hope people will gain an insight into and a broader appreciation of the man himself and the incredible range of interests that he had
2621588 we believe that our chinese new year gala is not only an important cultural event designed to bring china s unique customs to sheffield but will also break down barriers and promote chinese students influence on university life
2621589 the new year is an important event in the chinese calendar and cssa have organised a fitting way to celebrate the start of the year of the pig the gala will open up cultural exchanges between people fascinated by china s rich history traditions and culture
2621590 teaching remains an area of continuous development and change and this fair aims to increase the awareness of the many different routes that are available if you re interested in becoming a teacher you ll find plenty of information and advice helping you to do just that there are even opportunities for you to teach abroad
2621591 if you are exploring a surface with your hand you will control the position of your fingertips so as to get as much information as possible from each touch we are discovering that rats do something very similar with their whiskers that is they adjust the movements of their whiskers on a moment by moment basis using information from each contact to decide how best to position their whiskers for the next one
2621592 the production of bugsy malone two years ago was a huge success and we are looking forward to the challenge of improving on it it will be exciting to find out which musical we are going to stage and i know everyone will work extremely hard to put on a good show
2621593 my presentation will cover topics from my two new books myself and other more important matters and the new philanthropists such as where and how we learn what we need for life and work and what the triggers are for change in personal life or business i am looking forward to visiting the university of sheffield an institution with an excellent reputation in the field of management and business teaching
2621594 we are extremely proud to be hosting as prominent a thinker and speaker as charles handy his research and work into organisational behaviour and management has influenced many people this breakfast meeting will be the perfect opportunity to meet him and hear his thoughts
2621595 everyone has a role to play in helping to make their neighbourhood a friendly cared for and safe place to live these days we often dont know the person who lives next door community events such as love where you live offer a way to break down barriers and build positive communities
2621596 the union of students is committed to helping students settle into the wider community in sheffield and helping student residents make a positive contribution to their neighbourhood area voluntary projects are one means of doing this and we hope this new project will help students and local residents get to know each other in a fun informal way
2621597 i think the love where you live project is a great idea and i am really looking forward to the day not only will the project help brighten up the street for local residents and students alike but it will give students and local residents the chance to come together get to know each other and carry out some worthwhile tasks
2621598 i would encourage local residents and students to join us on the day and help generate some community spirit and forge new friendships
2621599 this is an excellent initiative demonstrating the university and its union s long history of social responsibility and our commitment to strengthening community relations i hope all those involved in the project have an enjoyable day and that students build lasting friendships with local residents that flourish beyond their time at university
2621600 we are delighted with the high calibre performers we have managed to secure for this years spring concert series and the diverse range of music we have on offer from classics to modern compositions and world music there is something for everyone
2621601 international week is a great opportunity for staff students and members of the local community to come together and celebrate the vibrant diverse nature of our campus and at the same time have fun and enjoy themselves
2621602 this year we have invited the university to get more involved with the programme of events which has meant we have been able to offer a much more varied and fuller programme of events which i m hoping will make for the best international week ever
2621603 with over 4 100 international students and numerous international staff we have a richness of cultures and traditions on campus that need to be nurtured and maintained because of this the university welcomed the opportunity to work closely with the union to give international week the profile and importance it deserves
2621604 i hope staff and students enjoy the planned activities and that people in the local community take the opportunity to join in our celebrations by attending the international cultural evening
2621605 the use of biotechnology has long been a part of human civilisation and its continued application in the fields of agriculture food science and medicine has led to some fascinating and significant discoveries i welcome dr hulse to the university of sheffield for what will be a very interesting lecture
2621606 my lecture will address many aspects of biotechnology from its history in ancient mesopotamia egypt and india to its modern day uses and the opportunities agricultural food and pharmaceutical biotechnologies offer universities i will also address the ethical issues of the genetic modification of food crops human embryonic stem cells and biopiracy
2621607 i feel very proud to have received this award and to be considered a role model to other female students studying engineering i have thoroughly enjoyed all the projects i have completed during my time at university and i am very grateful for all the support and guidance i have received from my department and my tutors during my studies
2621608 i am delighted that my passion and enthusiasm for engineering has been recognised with this accolade and i look forward to starting a long and successful career in engineering when i graduate this summer
2621609 we are all extremely proud of holly over the last three and a half years holly has continually impressed us with her achievements and we feel very honoured to have her as one of our students i wish holly every success with her final year and her future career she is an excellent student who i am certain would be an asset to any employer
2621610 holly has demonstrated excellent engineering ability which coupled with her charismatic intelligent and enthusiastic style make her an excellent role model and a very worthy winner of the 2007 ford wise prize
2621611 the public services academy will build upon public service research expertise and experience to develop beneficial partnerships with public service organisations in order to support and enhance public services in the region the psa will be based in icoss which has already established itself as a hub for social science research and knowledge transfer within the university
2621612 this is a very exciting initiative by the university with its regional partners professionals in the region and beyond will be able to draw upon and share the expertise of our social scientists to enhance the provision and delivery of their services
2621613 south yorkshire police has enjoyed a long and fruitful relationship with the university and this now steps up to a new level with the creation of the public services academy in addition to building valuable relationships with individual researchers and faculties public services like ours will now be able to access a wealth of information from a multi disciplinary and dynamic team
2621614 a person s voice characteristics convey features of that person s identity such as what sex and age they are and where they are from if the person is using the device as their primary mode of communication it is important that the output voice is suitable to represent that person
2621615 we contacted ian mcmillan because his voice could provide that geographic identity for a local vivoca user his professional experience as a voice artist also means he was able to make accurate consistent and natural sounding recordings from read speech ian is the first of our vivoca voices eventually we would like to be able to present a client with a choice of male and female voices and perhaps also adapt their chosen voice to resemble that of the client before their speech deteriorated
2621616 im happy excited and flattered that my voice is going to be used to help others find their voice for years ive wanted people to find their creative voice but heres a concrete example of them finding their real voice
2621617 we are extremely grateful to ian mcmillan for all his help with this device and for helping us tailor the vivoca aid to the specific needs of local users
2621618 i am really honoured to have been awarded this prize and am grateful to the rae that they have chosen me as a winner this year teaching is not just a job for me but my passion and when students tell me that they have enjoyed my modules then all the effort is worthwhile i am constantly striving to improve my modules and create the best possible learning environments for my students
2621619 this award is a wonderful recognition of elena s impact on teaching and learning in engineering it is also an endorsement of all of the educational innovations and developments by her colleagues in the department over the years which has made us one of the top choices for students
2621620 i am extremely pleased that the royal academy of engineering has recognised elena for her commitment to teaching and to the continuing development of courses in the department of mechanical engineering
2621621 it is evidence of the university s strong commitment to high quality teaching that the rae has recognised sheffield academics for two consecutive years
2621622 this is the first time the university has decided to hold a play for national science and engineering week and i am really excited to be involved the aim of the play is to explain some of the most exciting developments in research and to celebrate our own yorkshire hero i hope families enjoy the storyline and at the same time increase their understanding of science
2621623 we decided to become involved in this module because we thought it would give the students an insight into people with cerebral palsy and give them the opportunity to think about how they can use their engineering skills to cater for the individual needs of a person with a disability
2621624 we are very grateful to the staff and students of the university of sheffield for showing interest in this subject and we look forward to seeing what ideas the students come up with to address the areas of kieron s life he has told us through his communication aid he would like improving
2621625 until now the module projects have focused on industrial problems and have involved students working with clients such as tesco and the child resistant packaging company
2621626 making kieron s life easier is not just a way of teaching our students that engineering can be used in more human contexts but that it is also a professional responsibility of the engineer to consider issues such as disability
2621627 i am really excited about participating in this module as it will give me the opportunity to apply the engineering skills learnt so far in a real world context and hopefully improve kieron s quality of life
2621628 the module will also give me the chance to do something practical challenging and rewarding whilst gaining valuable experience
2621629 i am very pleased to have been recognised for my work on raising awareness of environmental issues at the university global warming is the greatest threat to all living things and we have a responsibility not only to our children but to our children s children i believe that even the small changes like those currently being made within the building where i work can make huge differences
2621630 people don t usually worry about issues until they directly affect them i hope by getting environmental messages across in a fun and accessible way that it will ultimately lead to bigger results the key is to start small and change habits of a lifetime bit by bit as a real motivator i strongly recommend that people watch al gore s an inconvenient truth
2621631 we received a large number of high standard nominations for the environmental champion award we greatly appreciate the effort made by so many members of staff in raising the profile of environmental issues whether in relation to energy saving waste management or sustainable transport
2621632 richard in particular has gone beyond the call of duty to promote environmental issues both at the university and in his personal life we are delighted to announce him as our first ever winner
2621633 faith scriptures and universities in an inter faith and secular society
2621634 the influence of faith in civil society is highly significant and very topical i welcome professor ford to the university of sheffield and look forward to his contribution to a lecture series that began in 1953 and that has produced some extremely interesting and stimulating lectures
2621635 i am delighted to be coming to the university of sheffield to deliver the stephenson lectures sheffield has a very distinguished record in my field and many others i will attempt in my lectures to engage creatively both with the main sheffield speciality of biblical studies and with the broader issue of how 21st century universities should be shaped in the face of massive challenges above all i hope to put taking religion seriously high on the agenda for universities in our multi faith and secular society
2621636 the scientific community can really help here both in identifying new strategies to assist businesses reduce their overall emissions burden and in understanding different options for offsetting any emissions that cannot be reduced any further
2621637 we look forward to building a successful partnership with the acte global centre at the same time as educating businesses about business travel and keeping environmental research at the top of the university s research agenda
2621638 we are delighted to be forming this unique partnership with the university of sheffield businesses can and must get a handle on the environmental impact of their travel profile and what we have found is that they can achieve a great deal simply by travelling smarter with this partnership we hope to help businesses become much more strategic about their travel choices and reduce their emissions profile
2621639 the university offers fairtrade products as well as ethically sourced and local products in our retail outlets halls and bars we work closely with suppliers to provide a wide range of fairly traded products and want to encourage people to consider fairtrade whenever possible
2621640 this fortnight is a fantastic opportunity to learn more about fair trade and the broader environmental and ethical debates that exist in the world today
2621641 it is over 10 years since the first breast cancer genes brca1 and brca2 were identified and since then researchers have been trying to identify the more common breast cancer gene variants with little success until now these results show what can be achieved with international collaboration
2621642 this study will pave the way for further collaborations so that more of these variants can be identified leading to a much better picture of the genetic pathways involved in breast cancer
2621643 discovering differences in genes that are often associated with cancers helps identify people at greater risk it also helps increase our understanding of the disease
2621644 international collaborations are a powerful means of hunting down small but significant genetic variations that increase cancer risk knowing these variations gives the potential for tailoring screening and even treatment
2621645 the activity sessions are a great opportunity for families to work together on a science project and learn about dna and how it connects them together
2621646 it is also a unique opportunity for parents and young people to find out how science can be fun and exciting and how it can affect their everyday lives and decisions
2621647 the dental school has an international reputation for its research work and we are delighted that we will be gaining new space and facilities some of the new wing is also designed to help us to accommodate an increased number of undergraduate dental students which will help to overcome the national shortage of dentists
2621648 staff at the hospital are obviously delighted that work has begun on this exciting development and we eagerly await its completion we are grateful for the support we have had from all stakeholders involved in getting this development off the ground in particular the national dental workforce unit for their part in attracting nhs funding for this project
2621649 the extension is a joint venture between the university of sheffield and the nhs it has been a challenge to produce a design which is sympathetic to both the brick built structure of the charles clifford dental hospital and the university s 1980 s school of dentistry whilst taking into account the level differences between the two buildings
2621650 through careful choice of cladding system and a strong linear design we have managed to create a visually exciting structure between the two existing buildings whilst at the same time addressing all of our client s requirements in terms of space and function within a confined area
2621651 its a great honour to have been nominated in this way the research took several years to bring to fulfilment but the business of pursuing empson round the world from beijing to hong kong to tokyo and boston was enormous fun for me im really pleased that people feel the result has been worth all the effort
2621652 it was beginning to look as if these systems either didn t exist or were too difficult to find using current telescopes finding this system was important because their existence had been predicted for so long but try as we might we couldnt find any of these cannibalised stars
2621653 this research not only confirms a long standing theory but it also shows that we can actually find and study these objects which will hopefully allow astronomers to learn a lot more about how stars die
2621654 it was previously believed that sperm not only competed against rival males but that they also competed against each other in order to fertilise the female egg however this research shows that when the pressure from rival males is high individual sperm will cooperate with one another to ensure that at least one of their siblings successfully reaches the female egg
2621655 i am delighted to be associated with this new institute which will promote a better understanding of chinese language and culture in sheffield and beyond i find it a great honour to be able to open a centre which will bring together in friendship and partnership representatives from china and britain and harmonise relations between both countries
2621656 i wish the university of sheffield and its chinese partners every success with their new venture
2621657 the university is committed to making the confucius institute a thriving strong institute that raises awareness and educates the public about china its culture and its language
2621658 the core of the confucius institute is to use the expertise of the university and of our partner universities in china to promote knowledge and understanding of china in the broader community
2621659 we are eager to hear from organisations in the public and private sectors about what their needs are and how we can work together to help the whole region to build its links with the worlds most dynamic economy and society
2621660 we are delighted that our continued efforts to create a more sustainable approach to transport policy at the university have been recognised through being shortlisted for a green gown award
2621661 the itp has proved beneficial to both staff and students and the local community offering real travel choice and adopting an approach based on travel choice and not an anti car campaign
2621662 durrington s purpose was to celebrate life and deposit the dead in the river for transport to the afterlife while stonehenge was a memorial and even final resting place for some of the dead stonehenge s avenue discovered in the 18th century is aligned on the midsummer solstice sunrise while the durrington avenue lines up with midsummer solstice sunset
2621663 this discovery at durrington walls sheds light on the actual purpose of stonehenge and shows that it wasn t a monument in isolation but part of a larger complex
2621664 it is vital in our understanding of stonehenge and paves the way for further investigation at the site in the summer and hopefully more remarkable finds
2621665 the findings reveal that working on trains impacts people s work life balance as they can use their travel time constructively which can save them from having to work in the evening or weekend or at least take the pressure off however some of the technologies such as hand held devices and mobile phones can impinge on personal time with people answering work e mails and phone calls even whilst travelling or worst still on holiday
2621666 the research shows that the boundary between work and non work can become blurred not through technology itself but how people choose to use it our findings could have implications for the recognition given to the utility of travel time and the way the time is managed
2621667 it really made me want to qualify and get out there into practice because after all the training it was exciting to get on and do the job
2621668 giving students a positive experience in a high quality nhs dentistry setting similar to a dental practice they are likely to work in is vitally important to the future of nhs services in general practice
2621669 together with other developments this scheme has enabled the school to triple the number of hygiene and therapy students on the course and substantially increase the number of dental students we take in each year but it s not just about numbers this will build a dental workforce better prepared to meet the needs of local communities the pilot at taptonville house has been invaluable in preparing to roll this programme out to several other local practices
2621670 this development into general practice would not have been possible without the skill and dedication of the taptonville house staff
2621671 this provides hope for people having difficulty finding a dentist while it is no quick fix this approach will produce newly qualified dental staff who are more confident more experienced and better able to understand local patients needs
2621672 this event is a unique opportunity for women starting out in setm careers to come together with high profile female academics and hr professionals who can offer much needed support and advice
2621673 it also offers invaluable networking time where women with similar interests from across the region can discuss the opportunities and challenges they face in their field of work and forge collaborative relationships which will help them professionally and personally
2621674 the university of sheffield has identified supporting the advancement of women in setm as one of its diversity priorities and this year we have launched our women s network for all women staff with a dedicated strand for women working in setm
2621675 i think it important that women starting out careers in setm are able to access advice and guidance from more experienced women academics and i am very pleased to be able to share my knowledge and experience and play such an active role at this event
2621676 i am absolutely delighted to receive this honour and i am very grateful to the university of sheffield the sheffield medical school and the sheffield teaching hospitals trust for all the great support and opportunities they have given me over many years
2621677 i am very grateful to have worked in a research led university and to have been able to collaborate with excellent colleagues in other departments i particularly acknowledge the support of professor tony weetman during his deanship of the medical school the synergistic relationship between university and nhs is extremely important in my case between the school and the children s hospital
2621678 i am delighted that the outstanding work of professors duff and tanner has been recognised in this way both of them have made huge contributions to the success of the school of medicine and biomedical sciences in teaching and research as well as to the health of the nation and their awards are richly deserved
2621679 this project builds upon the department s existing and long established expertise in both eu politics and multi level governance and extends this into a new area in which the university has rapidly developing academic and research links
2621680 this study will add significantly to our knowledge of both the politics of eu enlargement and the evolution of governance in the region since the break up of yugoslavia
2621681 in analysing regional governance the dominant concept in improving public policy is multi level governance this is particularly important for south east european countries where the need for strong linkage between various levels of government is apparent the south east european research centre with the advantage of being located in an eu country greece and at the same time within the balkan region is well placed to contribute to the understanding of such issues and to add to knowledge of the international research community
2621682 as a team we have worked extremely well together bringing together our different skills and experience to turn our ideas into a viable product
2621683 we can t wait to develop our planimals idea further and hopefully add a little fun and novelty to everyday time management in the future

2621696 being at the championships was amazing and it was fantastic to win in such an important competition my involvement with shuoc has really helped me achieve this success and i m definitely going to continue orienteering with the club i now want to qualify for the world championships in the ukraine next august where i hope to come in the top ten
2621697 our research could have significant implications for conservation foraging behaviour in our model is flexible and the diet of individual species adjusts to the addition or deletion of species therefore our model can predict the consequences of significant changes in the environment on the complexity of food webs and ecological communities
2621698 i am delighted that mr willis is coming to visit the centre many of the changes we are seeing in the environment are connected to the carbon cycle and making sense of these complex links requires researchers from many different fields to work together i look forward to showing mr willis how the centre fosters this interaction and the obvious benefits this brings
2621699 i am delighted that the university has been recognised as a world class institution for its academic excellence and dedication to research these rankings are not only a wonderful achievement for the university but they also enhance the reputation of the city as a whole

2621730 the london police force was originally set up to deter crime by patrolling the streets too often to allow crimes to take place however policing in humans has become a big political issue as we don t know if it actually works
2621731 our results show that in modern day insect societies it is mainly social sanctions that reduce the numbers of workers that commit crimes in this they provide evidence for something that has proved notoriously hard to demonstrate in human society that better law enforcement can act as a crime deterrent and lead to fewer individuals behaving antisocially
2621732 this is an opportunity to assemble scientists from around the word in a wide range of disciplines so that we can share ideas discuss future plans and begin working towards the next generation of deep underground experiments

2621735 this innovative project combines the latest stem cell technology with novel tissue engineering while our specific aim is to improve stent efficacy for cardiovascular diseases we will also learn a lot about how stem cells integrate and function on a medical device this is tremendously important for many applications
2621736 we are very pleased that the dti and mrc have agreed to support this ground breaking programme the treatment of cardiovascular disease represents a rapidly growing challenge for the future and the combination of stem cell science surface technology and clinical research will provide a new paradigm in treatment
2621737 this initiative provides a real opportunity to harness the world class expertise that we possess in the uk and direct it towards the task of wealth creation biotechnology is of crucial importance in our society by providing a focus for collaboration and delivery this partnership should establish british industry as the world leader in this area and an attractive proposition for investors
2621738 mozart s birthday celebration concert will be a fitting climax to a concert series which explores and celebrates the variety and complexity of music i am delighted to able to bring together university groups and outside performers to create such a diverse concert series which has something for everyone from classics to modern compositions and world music
2621739 our aim for the festival is simply to get people talking about politics particularly young people we have sent out invitations to the festival to all of the secondary schools sixth form colleges and further education colleges in sheffield our aim is to get as many young people as possible to attend so that the festival extends beyond the university and becomes a community event
2621740 the festival is the perfect opportunity for young people and members of the public to discuss political issues that matter to them with such a high turnout of local councillors expected and a local mp and mep attending it is the ideal forum for people to engage with politics and discuss local national and international issues
2621741 the sheffield festival of politics is an excellent innovation at a time of considerable disenchantment with and cynicism about politics especially among young people i am delighted that students from the department have been involved with this initiative and that the university is making its facilities available for this event i wish the organisers of the festival every success
2621742 for good or bad politics touches all of our lives whether political activist or cynical bystander the festival is an opportunity to speak up and debate your future

2621754 the re launch of the sshh campaign by the university and the union is fully supported by the sheffield safer communities partnership this is an extremely positive step in reducing the few complaints of noise nuisance in the area and can only go on to improve community relations with the university
2621755 the broomhill forum welcomes a re launch of this intiative by the university and union which shows their commitment to working together for the good of the whole community
2621756 the university of sheffield is one of the premier universities in the uk for biomedical science and i was very keen to study here i had already received an unconditional offer from the university but due to financial difficulties i was unable to confirm my offer
2621757 however this scholarship has made my dream of studying at sheffield come true and i can t wait to start making it a reality
2621758 caezaan emerged as the triumphant winner in what turned out to be an exceptionally close final
2621759 his charm creativity and stunning knowledge marked caezaan as a natural and thoroughly deserving winner of the competition the sheer emotion on the faces of caezaan and his family when he was declared the winner was extremely moving i am hopeful that sheffield can rise to the expectation and provide an exciting educational journey for him

2621761 the airtel scholar hunt has provided the university with an opportunity to raise its profile in india and is part of a wider initiative to develop collaborative links with organisations such as the indian institutes of technology
2621762 we look forward to welcoming caezaan to sheffield and wish him the very best in his studies
2621763 this year s soams summer school has been a tremendous success participants have been able to get a taste of what medical school is like by undertaking a range of exciting medically related activities the summer school is culmination of an extended series of activities soams students undertake to raise their aspirations and realise their dream of studying medicine i would like to thank all those who contribute to making the summer school such a worthwhile experience for all involved
2621764 the soams summer school has given me a great insight into medicine and hospital life it was truly inspirational and has made me even more determined to pursue a career in medicine i particularly enjoyed clinical skills where we learned cpr as it is something that is very useful in everyday life
2621765 i am delighted to be speaking at this year s tuco conference and that the university has once again been chosen as the ideal conference venue the framing the future research project is an important piece of research for the catering industry and will help improve services right across the uk university catering sector
2621766 i m happy about the garden because it s a place i can come and remember my dad and the school can remember him too
2621767 this project has been a fantastic experience and a great opportunity to work with other students in my department the project has required a lot of planning and commitment but it has all been worth it creating a place where the children can play and learn
2621768 we are delighted that through sheffieldvolunteering this group of geography students have been able to use their skills and knowledge and make such a positive contribution in the local community i hope the children get hours of enjoyment thanks to the students hard work
2621769 the school wildlife garden has provided a focal point for the centre of the new school by leading on this project the sheffield students have helped us create an excellent resource to support children s learning
2621770 i think it is looking really good i would like to use the garden for picnics in the hot weather and for studying and hunting bugs
2621771 our results illustrate the pitfalls involved in using morphological data to study the ecology of extinct animals including dinosaurs and pterodactyles
2621772 while we acknowledge that these comparisons do offer clues to the ecological traits of extinct creatures we hope that our research shows that biomechanical analysis is also needed to supplement such efforts in order to paint a more realistic portrait of the prehistoric landscape
2621773 britain needs a bill of rights to protect the liberty of the individual
2621774 we recommend for inclusion amongst others the right to trial by jury the right to administrative justice and international human rights as yet not incorporated into uk law
2621775 we believe that there is a strong case for detailed rights for children and we recommend that the public should be consulted about including specific rights for other vulnerable groups
2621776 we want to see a bill of rights that would set the bar for the universal standards to which everyone is entitled and fills the gaps in the protection of more vulnerable people such as the elderly children or people with learning disabilities
2621777 most interesting and certainly unexpected when this work began is the geography of those households who are neither rich nor poor over time it has become clear that there is less and less room in the south for them they have either moved elsewhere or become poor
2621778 the weather was very wet over the two day event but that didn t stop the staff getting stuck in and getting the job done everyone really seemed to enjoy themselves and i have had very positive feedback from the organisations they worked with
2621779 i am extremely grateful to all the staff that took part and i hope that we can do a similar event in the future and help even more community groups in the city and surrounding area
2621780 i really enjoyed the event it was great to see the transformation we made and know it would make a difference to the children who use the hi fives club as part of the event we painted a large room for the club to use as a seating and activity area cleared areas in the garden and assembled and stained bench tables
2621781 sram is a large department and it was a great opportunity to team up with people i don t usually work with id definitely do it again and id recommend anyone who wants to have fun and make a difference in the community to do the same
2621782 this one day meeting showcases some of the most important discoveries with embryonic stem cells in the last year it highlights not only the tremendous progress that is being made but also the challenges to understanding the biology so we can develop effective therapies to treat degenerative diseases
2621783 i am absolutely delighted to receive this award it is indicative of some of the exciting developments in teaching at the university of sheffield and the support available and also reflects the necessary team work and cooperation involved in teaching at sheffield the school of english cilass learning development and media unit and the library have all contributed greatly to my individual award i hope that my national teaching fellowship is also a reward for their endeavours
2621784 the school of english at the sheffield is an acknowledged centre of teaching innovation and duco van oostrum is our pioneer his ability to enthuse excite and inform is second to none and we are thrilled that his skill and dedication have been acknowledged in this way
2621785 i am extremely pleased that the higher education academy has recognised duco for his dedication to teaching his work with students is highly innovatory and exciting and colleagues in other departments learn a great deal from him
2621786 duco is an asset to the university and demonstrates the university s strong commitment to high quality teaching
2621787 it was a big surprise and a great honour to find out i had won this important award i am elated that my contributions to university life have been recognised and i am proud that i have made a difference coming from india completing my degree here is a massive achievement for me and to win this award rounds off what has been an incredible time for me here in sheffield

2621789 this scholarship means a lot to me it is not only about money it also includes a good programme of motivation and the chance to shadow business leaders the scholarship also encourages students to give back to their communities through voluntary work which i am really looking forward to
2621790 we are extremely proud of our students for gaining a ge foundation scholarship and for all the hard work and effort they have put in to achieve this success the scholarship will not only provide financial support but will also be an exciting learning experience for our students enhancing their experience at sheffield as well as bringing benefits back to the local community
2621791 education projects have always been a key priority for the ge foundation because of its ability to help people of all ages to extend horizons and fulfil their potential this scholarship programme is a good example of the foundations initiatives across the globe another important feature of the programme is that it encourages awardees to actively participate in their community reflecting ges own commitment to being a good corporate citizen
2621792 i was pleased to meet the young scholars who had won these awards the programme contributes to the goal of widening participation in higher education and to encouraging interest in stem science technology engineering and mathematics subjects
2621793 gardens act as a food supermarket for many visiting and breeding animals they are rich in biodiversity help balance the water table and allow children and adults to encounter wildlife the university wants to make this pledge because cutting edge environmental research is at the top of our agenda and we recognise the importance of gardens in both aiding our research and as valuable resource for learning and enjoyment
2621794 the gardens of england are under threat in london front gardens with an area 22 times the size of hyde park are now paved over and lost reducing havens for wildlife increasing the impact of flash flooding and contributing to climate change
2621795 through this manifesto natural england is calling to action businesses the public sector and the public to play their part and give gardens a future for the benefit of our own health and the survival of declining species such as hedgehogs frogs and bumblebees that live on our doorsteps
2621796 this manifesto will help improve gardening advice to encourage people to manage gardens in a way that benefits wildlife this is essential because as our climate changes the network of gardens could help wildlife to adapt and migrate throughout the country
2621797 it is inspiring to see leading wildlife and horticultural organisations working together to highlight the importance of gardens for both wildlife and for people s health and well being
2621798 i am extremely proud to be celebrating our 10th anniversary this year
2621799 it s a real pleasure to get out of london and come up north to sheffield for this conference skills for chefs is an excellent opportunity to meet dedicated people from the industry it s my first time at skills for chefs and a real honour to appear alongside people such as prue leith and michael caines
2621800 i am delighted to have won this award and feel really proud that all my hard work has paid off i would like to thank my tutors at sheffield college and the staff at fischers baslow hall for all the help and support they have given me i couldn t have done it without them
2621801 an event like skills for chefs is out of the norm in the middle east so it s a real pleasure to be here listening to some of the biggest names discussing the issues affecting the industry today and all the delegates here are a reflection of the care people involved feel for the industry as a whole
2621802 i welcome this opportunity to combine heritage research and entertainment to bring something special to blackpool over the next eighteen months the ahrc have given us a great opportunity to revitalise blackpools historic entertainment heritage by combining scholarship live theatre and audience participation it will be great fun
2621803 dr toulmin is thoroughly deserving of our support by ensuring that the knowledge and understanding generated by her research is widely disseminated she along with blackpool council offers a wonderful opportunity for visitors to blackpool to experience the outcomes of her research through these exciting exhibitions and performances
2621804 many people think of history and heritage as something that is encased in boxes or hung on walls yet it needn t be here is a chance for families to see the past brought to life and to experience first hand blackpool s rich show business history learn about the entertainments our ancestors enjoyed and to visit and rediscover some of the stunning historic venues blackpool has to offer
2621805 this award recognises our innovative research and gives us validation that this is an important area to continue to work in and which should lead to the earlier detection of bowel cancer
2621806 healthcare touches every person at some stage in their lives it is sad that almost all of the successful medical innovations such as penicillin the hip replacement and the catheter took 20 years or more to go from the inventors mind to the point where they actually benefited a patient
2621807 these awards aim to catalyse brilliant ideas from the very people who deliver care and make them available to patients after all one doctor s idea has the potential to change millions of lives around the world
2621808 we would like to say congratulations to all those students who have successfully completed both phases of the soams programme this year
2621809 we would like to wish all soams students the very best for the future
2621810 before i went on the soams programme i wasn t sure what i wanted to do as a career and never thought that i would be able to study medicine it has taught me that if you are interested in a subject and work hard enough you can do anything you put your mind to
2621811 the soams programme has been a great experience for me and the staff at the university of sheffield have been extremely supportive i am just crossing my fingers now that i get the a levels i need to get in to sheffield and one day graduate as a doctor
2621812 soams has given jenna so many opportunities which she would have probably never got without it it gave her the confidence to work towards a goal she believed unachievable i am so proud of her and the hard work she has put in to get where she is today
2621813 make a vital contribution to learning from the recent flooding events
2621814 we are delighted to have been awarded this grant and to be able to work in partnership with sheffield city council the environment agency and other organisations that have done so much already to improve the river don floodplain over the last decade or so we are looking forward to working with them to add our academic expertise and time to their practical skills and local knowledge
2621815 almost all of sheffield s strategic redevelopment areas are in the river corridors of the don sheaf and porter the project provides a chance to think hard about what to consider in the future and how to get the right balance of social economic and environmental benefits
2621816 the study used data from humans living in a pre industrial era so as to obtain results that are not affected by advanced health care and contraception they showed that as a consequence of a male twin s influence on a female s fertility mothers who produce opposite sex twins have fewer grandchildren and hence lower evolutionary fitness
2621817 these results provide the first evidence that sex ratio can influence offspring fitness and have significant implications for understanding the adaptive nature of sex ratios in humans
2621818 the energy technologies institute is a unique venture with a potential billion pound budget it is bringing together government and some of the worlds biggest companies and will help to establish the uk as one of the leaders in global clean energy development
2621819 the host will be the base for the institutes director and support staff and we anticipate it developing into a strategic focus for low carbon technology innovation in the uk and for international collaboration
2621820 the university of sheffield has a proven track record of successful industry partnership effective knowledge transfer and a reputation for world class research
2621821 our excellent facilities coupled with our existing and potential research into energy technologies make the university a prime site for hosting the new institute we have the unequivocal support of the regional development agency and other partners and will ensure if chosen that we deploy our experience and excellence in developing an institute the uk can be proud of
2621822 i am delighted to receive this honour and am also truly humbled i consider this an honour not only for myself but for the university my department and the colleagues i work with as an academic the university of sheffield which has a reputation for world class research has provided me with an excellent environment in which to develop my scientific interests i am extremely grateful for this and to the many friends who have supported me over the years in sheffield
2621823 i am absolutely delighted that sir david s outstanding achievements have been recognised in this way sir david is a rare example of somebody who is not only an international leading research scientist but also somebody who gives selflessly of his time for the benefit of uk science as a whole
2621824 the university of sheffield and its management school value this important collaboration with city college
2621825 we look forward to developing and strengthening this partnership in the future
2621826 we are delighted to be marking our ten year partnership with the university of sheffield with this special exchange trip it has given our students a great opportunity to learn more about the region and the large companies located within it the trip has also given our students the chance to establish links with companies in the region and discuss potential investment possibilities
2621827 the visit has really made me feel part of the university of sheffield and the city of sheffield the people here are so friendly and hospitable and they have made us feel very welcome the lectures we have attended and the visits the university arranged for us were very interesting and have helped me gain a better understanding of the region and industry in the uk
2621828 we wanted to organise an event that would help adults with learning disabilities experience the fun and friendship we did when we attended balls during our time at university
2621829 we have worked with sheffield s learning disability parliament speaking up for action sufa and their clients to help us find out what they would want from a ball and what the theme should be i hope everyone who attends has a wonderful time and has as much fun as we have had planning the event
2621830 we are thrilled to be working with students from the university to put on the glo ball we hope that the event will be a new experience for the adults who attend and that it will make them feel special it will also be an opportunity for them to make new friends and i am sure will also be something they remember for a long time
2621831 we believe people with learning disabilities should have the opportunity to experience as many of life s choices and chances as anyone else and through our services we promote this we are therefore delighted that the students are organising this event and that they sought our client s advice i will certainly be encouraging all my clients to go along and i am sure it will be a memorable and enjoyable evening for all those who attend
2621832 the uk produces around 330 million tonnes of waste annually and domestic and business users produce a quarter of this with this module we wanted to create a project that would educate our students about the necessity of engineering in waste management and how their skills can have a direct impact on the future of our planet
2621833 the nature of the module also allowed our students to work in teams and to interact with our industrial contacts and sponsors helping them prepare for life after they graduate
2621834 i think the secret of our success was our teamwork and friendship as a group everyone was willing to work and we all found every aspect of the module enjoyable we hope maybe one day our product will be available to consumers so watch this space
2621835 edison said 1 inspiration and 99 perspiration is needed to succeed
2621836 i have thoroughly enjoyed working with the students and staff at the university
2621837 i am very privileged and honoured to be given the opportunity to represent young british asians in the uk on such an auspicious occasion broadcast to millions across the globe
2621838 i feel that given all the negative publicity in recent years of asians in the uk this is our opportunity to make a statement about the telling contributions that the youth are making in the west whilst upholding the inherent cultural values of the east
2621839 we had a massive response with some outstanding people which made the task of choosing the winner very difficult indeed
2621840 i am delighted to be returning to the university to carry out the official opening of this impressive campus this multi disciplinary centre is an important development for both the university and the whole region creating an environment which allows industry to engage with university research
2621841 during my lifelong career in science i have benefited greatly from close multi disciplinary collaboration and i believe it is the right way to approach the emerging nanoscale landscape such collaboration promotes new insights and fosters new approaches which accelerates research progress and inevitably leads to major scientific breakthroughs
2621842 the creation of north campus and its multi disciplinary approach to research will help the university set the agenda in terms of global research activities it will also enable us to develop a number of strategic research partnerships and collaborations with world leading institutions and organisations as well as develop important industrial partnerships with high tech businesses
2621843 race for life is a great event it not only helps to advertise the need for cancer research and to raise money for cruk but it also helps our young researchers to join together in a common cause and to engage more actively with the local community
2621844 this is such a fantastic cause and i am pleased to say that i have participated and helped give something back to the department and local community both of which have greatly supported me since i arrived in sheffield
2621845 the aim of professor fluffy s medical adventure is to introduce the idea of higher education and what it is all about at an earlier age by offering a fun packed activity programme a tour around the university and introducing them to role models we hope to inspire the children and encourage them to think about their dreams and how they can achieve them
2621846 i think this project is an excellent initiative and the children are really excited about their medical adventure the activity day covers a number of issues and topics that are in the curriculum and gives the children the unique opportunity to learn in the setting of a university which i am sure will enhance their learning experience and interest
2621847 this development is an excellent example of how heritage led regeneration can transform a down at heel location while at the same time protecting one of sheffields most important historic buildings
2621848 scientists will use the markers to understand the differences and similarities between the different human embryonic cell lines that are available through the international stem cell initiative the effect will be to move research forward in a way that may not have been possible by individual labs or countries
2621849 this type of initiative is only possible through an organisation like the international stem cell forum which was able to bring together researchers from around the world to develop the basis for the eventual use of these exciting cells
2621850 the forum is committed to stimulating collaborations and providing backbone funding to allow these to flourish the potential of stem cell research is great we hope stem cell science will lead to the treatment of all manner of illnesses from diabetes to multiple sclerosis by creating this registry and making it freely available the isci will not only be a great resource for scientists across the world but will set the tone for the collaborative spirit in which we hope research will continue to be carried out for the benefit of the many not the few
2621851 our research shows that maintaining biodiversity levels is important in our increasingly urbanised world not only for conservation but also to enhance the quality of life for city residents
2621852 the quality of green spaces therefore needs to be considered to ensure that it serves the multiple purposes of enhancing biodiversity providing ecosystem services creating opportunities for contact with nature and enhancing psychological well being
2621853 the university arranges a number of different workshops throughout the year for local school pupils as part of the building bridges project the workshops that have been run to date have all been tremendous successes
2621854 the build a bridge university challenge day was no exception the event provided the perfect opportunity to raise young peoples awareness and aspirations of higher education while having some fun at the same time we were amazed by the level of communication and team work between students from different schools and by the high standard of the finished bridges
2621855 this has created a great opportunity for young people who would not normally have access to higher education the project has raised the aspirations of the young people and made them feel less daunted and more comfortable about the prospect of a university education
2621856 the day was extremely stimulating educational and enjoyable for all involved it was particularly impressive to see the level of cooperation and focus from the students from different schools
2621857 the project provides a great opportunity for the target students to visit a university and work with students on a real engineering task the main objective however is for the students to build confidence in the key skills of problem solving working in teams with new people and developing communication techniques
2621858 this trek was one of the most difficult things any of us has ever had to do it wouldn t have been possible without the support team consisting of two japanese ex sheffield exchange students who followed by car carrying our food and clothes
2621859 it was an incredible experience for all involved and we are delighted to have raised so much money for such a worthwhile cause the scenes as we arrived at the foot of mount fuji were breathtaking making this incredible experience completely worth it
2621860 derek walcott is the most renowned and respected english speaking poet in the world today and i am delighted to have awarded him with an honorary degree from the university of sheffield it is fitting that he received his award here in st lucia land of his birth and a source of inspiration for so many of his wonderful works of poetry and drama
2621861 brian lara is one of the most talented cricketers in the world today and i am delighted to be awarding him an honorary degree on behalf of the university of sheffield his achievements both cricketing and humanitarian have brought honour and distinction to the islands of trinidad and tobago
2621862 this is the first mathematical proof that lasting spontaneous recovery is not just possible but inevitable
2621863 there are many types of artificial neural network so it could have been that this effect applies only to certain types of network however our research is independent of the particular type of network considered so it should apply to the vast networks of neurons in the human brain too
2621864 this competition has really helped our business grow the support and advice we received through the course of the competition has really got us underway in the world of business
2621865 the business planning competition is a great way for students to develop their ideas into an operating business the cash prize is a great boost for any new enterprise and i encourage all students and alumni since 2002 to get involved and submit a business plan for the 2007 awards
2621866 getting back into the workplace has been a huge step for me and through the scheme i ve updated my skills in all sorts of areas i now feel ready to apply for work
2621867 all the candidates benefited enormously from the scheme and gave extremely positive feedback about their experiences after identifying their employment goals many are now considering applying for jobs at the university a large part of the success of the scheme can be attributed to the enormous enthusiasm and commitment of the mentors all expressed how pleased they were to be involved in the scheme and what a beneficial development opportunity it had been
2621868 i welcome this opportunity to bring together the leading international thinkers in the field and to explore how the future of enterprise and entrepreneurship education can be progressed
2621869 this is a great opportunity for people to experience brand new music fusing together acoustic instruments and electronic sounds and we are lucky to have some world renowned musicians visiting the university the workshop will also provide a great chance to explore the musical possibilities available with the latest technologies and i encourage everyone to come and learn more about this fascinating genre of music
2621870 for a long time there has been much debate about the appropriate response to psychological trauma this is primarily due to adverse outcomes of psychological debriefing the most popular organisational response to trauma the lack of evidence on the best response to trauma has left employers with little or no guidance on what to do for the best
2621871 our research moves beyond this deadlock and in line with the national institute for health and clinical excellence and provides evidence about different approaches which work it also identifies that the way individual employees perceive the support offered by their organisation post trauma could play an important part in their recovery and reduce sickness absence post trauma
2621872 we are delighted that we are able to move forward with the second phase of our development of this site this next phase will ensure that we can bring the historic victorian wing of the old jessop hospital back into daily use we know that the building is a much loved landmark and part of the city s history therefore renovating and protecting this heritage for future generations is very important to us
2621873 what s more we now have the chance to provide our students with outstanding facilities in iconic buildings both historic and newly built and are able to transform and regenerate this key site for everyone in the city
2621874 most people wonder what would happen if they had to take over the controls of a jumbo jet now there s a chance to find out and to support a good cause at the same time at least you re sure to walk away from a crash in the simulator
2621875 while uk mathematics is generally very strong our funding system forces our students to complete their phds much more quickly than their counterparts elsewhere in europe or the usa this makes it difficult for them to learn more background than they immediately need for their phd projects moreover many of our students are in small departments which do not have the resources to teach a broad range of graduate level courses
2621876 i am very excited by the magic project which will enable fourteen universities to pool their efforts and so radically improve the teaching provision for our graduate students
2621877 in america the evercare programme was originally delivered in nursing homes and included extra nursing care to look after patients when they fell ill thus reducing the need for hospital admissions in the uk this is not the case
2621878 the evercare programme ensures that valuable care reaches some of the most vulnerable members of society but it won t lead to a vast reduction in emergency admissions unless the system is radically redesigned to improve integration between primary and secondary care
2621879 this is a very exciting project for genesys and everyone involved is looking forward to getting started having the opportunity to work on a project that could help children with cystic fibrosis locally nationally and even internationally will be extremely rewarding for us
2621880 i think the paper booklet that already exists is an extremely helpful document and will continue to be used by children but with new technology and young people s continued interest in the internet and computers i think we also need something that will tap into this interest
2621881 i hope with the help of genesys the website will build on the success of the booklet and will be a helpful tool for children and teenagers with cystic fibrosis if children and teenagers have a fun interesting and accurate way to manage their medication they are more likely to work out their doses correctly and will therefore control their symptoms more effectively
2621882 i think the website is a wonderful idea and i hope with the help of solvay healthcare and professor taylor genesys will be able to create a website that builds on the booklet i created
2621883 it is very exciting that an idea i first put together on paper could soon be on the web and help thousands of people
2621884 given the rise in energy prices and the need to reduce co2 emissions drastically this is a major step forward for the future of road construction both here in the uk and overseas it is particularly imperative for countries that are currently developing their surface infrastructures as this new research will allow these countries to build and maintain roads much more cost effectively and at the benefit of the environment
2621885 this is the second time i have visited one of breast cancer campaign s funded research projects at the university of sheffield this year i am delighted that breast cancer research of such a high standard is being carried out in my constituency and look forward to seeing the findings of the research published in the future
2621886 funding from breast cancer campaign in a superb research environment created by the university of sheffield has enabled us to gain new and important insights into how our cells prevent cancer in addition to improving our knowledge of the way cancer susceptibility genes work this study provide pointers for the development of new therapeutics for treatment we are indebted to the bcc its fundraisers and donors without whom this work might not have been undertaken
2621887 the university and its union have been extremely supportive the union has given me a forum to play my music my personal tutor has offered constant encouragement and the university print service has been an excellent resource for my promotional material the entrepreneurial skills i have gained through my degree have also been vital for my success this knowledge has allowed me to manage myself and do all my own promotion and marketing as well as managing the sales and finance side when producing distributing and selling my cds
2621888 music for me is my form of creative expression and release and i just hope that people enjoy my music and can take something from it this is a real turning point for me and i m really looking forward to seeing what the future holds
2621889 rod is a very talented young man both as a business studies student and as a musician he has worked very hard to manage his studies and his music simultaneously achieving success in both all of us in the management school and in the university are extremely proud of him we wish him every success in the future
2621890 i remember when i was at school attending a lecture at the university of sheffield and how exciting it was to do so i had that opportunity then and i am now in the position to provide it myself i hope that today s sheffield sixth formers and the general public enjoy my talk as much as i enjoyed my first lecture
2621891 we are delighted that the university has been chosen to host and launch this year s res public lecture professor collier has extensive knowledge experience and understanding of issues facing african nations and i am sure those who attend the lecture will be given a thought provoking insight into these topics
2621892 without students from sheffieldvolunteering amy s retreat would be unable to carry out many of its fundraising events the student volunteers are always enthusiastic and willing to go that extra mile to help us out often working on saturdays and at short notice i hope this extra funding will mean more charities like ours will benefit from the dedication and hard work of sheffieldvolunteering
2621893 i am delighted that we have received this money from the big lottery fund and heacf the extra funds mean we will be able to develop even more partnerships with local organisations as well as continuing to support the organisations we already work with
2621894 there is a huge pool of skills people and experience at the university and the funding award will allow us to spend more time setting up initiatives to utilise these resources staff and students at the university have so much to offer and it is our job to get them to realise their potential and share what they enjoy to benefit others if we can increase the number of those engaging in community volunteering it will be a huge investment in our city
2621895 i am thrilled that sheffieldvolunteering has been awarded this new funding and are able to invest the money in projects like our playground
2621896 something so simple as painting our playground has had a major impact on the children and has made their lunchtimes and other break times much more fun educational and enjoyable making them happier and more eager to learn in the classroom i m extremely grateful to sheffieldvolunteering and the students who volunteered to help us and i wish them all the success in developing their service and offering more city schools and organisations much needed help and support
2621897 i would encourage local people of all ages to come along and listen to the wonderful sound of the wind orchestra the music is played with great skill and enthusiasm and the conductor tony houghton is extremely talented and experienced
2621898 what s more a large proportion of the money raised from the concert will be going to charity so people can listen to the music in the grand setting of firth hall knowing their attendance will help put a smile on the faces of the children at sheffield children s hospital
2621899 we are extremely grateful to the university for deciding to support the sheffield childrens hospital charity again
2621900 the money raised will fund our arts for health programme which enables artists and musicians to work with many of our young patients who are visiting and staying in hospital the activities help to alleviate some anxieties help pass time and add lots of fun
2621901 with this production we have taken the structure of opera and tried to utilise some of its devices such as the forms of recitative we have also used a blend of singing styles and have cast singers from both genres
2621902 it is a new and exciting genre which i think will appeal to a wide range of musical tastes the text is sharp and witty and the main characters are real people and exist in a real world which i believe will engage the audience
2621903 it s highly uncommon to be able to experience two relatively rare and exciting music genres in one night i hope people take this unique opportunity to come along to one of the evenings and see what two of the university s most talented composers have put together
2621904 what ever your music tastes there is something for everyone
2621905 since their very establishment call centres have been at the height of controversy and many myths have evolved about their nature
2621906 this research provides a critical understanding of how the call centre industry has developed both in the uk and overseas hopefully this new insight will further stimulate debate and provide guidance for policy and practice in order for the management of call centres to be improved
2621907 we are thrilled that the union has been shortlisted for this award without student volunteers many community initiatives in the city wouldn t be possible and i am delighted that our students hard work and dedication has been recognised with this nomination
2621908 i am extremely proud of all the students who have offered their spare time and skills to help community projects and have made this nomination possible
2621909 the university and its union has a long history of social responsibility and we are both committed to fostering positive relations with the local community this nomination demonstrates the outstanding contribution our students make to the city and their continued effort and dedication
2621910 this event is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the community of sheffield students alumni and staff that has grown in st lucia and tobago
2621911 we are also thrilled to be able to welcome his excellency julian robert hunte minister of external affairs from st lucia and his excellency professor george maxwell richards president of the republic of trinidad and tobago into this extended family by conferring them with the honorary degree of doctor of letters
2621912 the fairs sponsored by pricewaterhousecoopers the independent and graduate prospects are extremely popular so much so we have had to increase the size of the exhibition to meet with the demand from employers who are keen to make contact with students and graduates from sheffield s and yorkshire s universities it s an ideal occasion for students nearing the end of their courses to meet and question some of the leading graduate employers and the student employment fair is a great opportunity for students because early experience of working life improves career prospects no end
2621913 despite what people think females do not actually like sperm and make it difficult for the sperm to fertilise and egg basically sperm is a potentially dangerous foreign body to females and is not welcomed into the body
2621914 for this reason sperm have had to develop a range of ways of getting around this problem resulting in an enormous range of shapes sizes and functions across the animal and plant world
2621915 understanding the evolution of sperm and their design is fundamental in helping to solve today s fertility issues
2621916 as male sperm counts decline the issue of assisted fertility is becoming more and more important the science behind donor insemination is incredible and the more we understand and improve on the process the more successful this kind of treatment will become
2621917 our scientists use laboratory research and real patient data to understand the underlying causes of a number of diseases and conditions allowing us to develop new ways of diagnosing treating curing and monitoring these conditions
2621918 we focus our work on a number of key areas in neuroscience infection and immunity cancer cardiovascular disease bone biology pathology and molecular genetics
2621919 these new facilities will give us the equipment and facilities that we need to continue to develop our research hopefully leading to better treatments and potential cures
2621920 the judges were impressed with the quality and quantity of business plans submitted there is a growing culture of enterprise and innovation among white rose graduates and the breadth of business proposals really demonstrates the range of skills that todays graduates have to offer
2621921 this is my first world champs and i m really excited to be taking part in two disciplines the team has real potential to get medals and top 10 placings being part of shuoc has enabled me to train with other top class athletes on excellent areas and the team support has definitely contributed to our success so far this year
2621922 i am delighted to have won this award and am extremely grateful to the department for nominating me biomedical engineering is a relatively new discipline in the uk and it is therefore particularly important to promote the subject and engage the scientists and engineers of the future
2621923 school pupils often have misconceptions of what a career in science is all about and what a scientist really does with the reactiv8 project we hope to break the mould and show that science can be interesting and accessible to all
2621924 i am really pleased to have won the award when i heard the news i was in australia and i didn t really believe it was happening and i still don t think it has sunk in i have always wanted to be a journalist i learnt so much during my degree at the university of sheffield and i have met so many amazing people
2621925 we are enormously proud of felicity and we toasted her at our degree day reception she will enhance the reputation of journalism at the university wherever she goes
2621926 i am delighted to have received the lectureship this award means that i will be able to continue my teaching within the department and carry on with clinical research in oral neuroscience as part of a very strong research cluster within the dental hospital at the university
2621927 this is a fantastic opportunity to work at such an important site we know that church hole was excavated very rapidly by the victorians in the 1870s and as a result very little is known about the animals and people who inhabited this cave during the ice age
2621928 many of the bones and stone tools would have been thrown away and now lie within the victorian spoil heap directly outside the cave s entrance our plan is to excavate this spoil heap and find the original ice age sediments below which contain bones and other artefacts from the period the excavation will considerably improve our understanding of the ice age geology of the crags and of the activities of our ice age ancestors in the region
2621929 the excavations are also likely to show just how much archaeology has developed in the last 80 years since the previous excavations what were then considered of no interest are now crucial scientific clues to life in the gorge 13 000 years ago and more
2621930 this is once again a wonderful opportunity to highlight one of the regions major cultural sites and invite visitors to experience the process of archaeology in action there will be opportunities to talk to the excavation team and view the recent finds the museum will also be running a series of activities alongside the excavation including regular tours to church hole and robin hood cave
2621931 the conference brings together a tremendous group of specialists and participants at a time when social democrats in europe are struggling to find their political direction and new progressive governments in latin america are fighting to achieve basic social democratic objectives of social justice as well as engaging in our academic debates we have an obligation to engage with the wider communities of political actors from which we should both benefit this conference is an example of that obligation in practice
2621932 i believe so strongly in volunteering and its benefits for me it was such a big part of my university life and i loved working with the children
2621933 his achievements are quite outstanding few people give so much time over such a long period
2621934 the schools outreach programme has been extremely popular the labs are constantly booked out by schools and the students who come to use the facilities are always enthusiastic about the experience
2621935 school pupils who visit the laboratory will not only be given the opportunity to stretch themselves and conduct challenging experiments but they will also see that chemistry can be fun and exciting
2621936 we hope to inspire teachers to carry out more practical work within schools for example we hope to involve pgce science teacher trainees in the laboratory classes and turn on the next generation of teachers to practical science
2621937 with the knowledge and technology available to us today there has never been a better time for architects and developers to go green
2621938 green roofs help keep buildings cool in summer filter pollution reduce rainwater run off and provide wildlife habitats they can also extend the life of a roof compared to a traditional design and can help to create beautiful and inspirational buildings for our cities
2621939 green roofs are not just ideal they are a realistic viable option for developers in many parts of the world green roof technology is part of mainstream building design south yorkshire can now lead the way in promoting its use in the uk
2621940 we are very pleased to be supporting the steelers in this innovative partnership this is a real opportunity to combine sporting and academic excellence and we are sure that it will help attract the brightest players in the world of ice hockey to the city of sheffield
2621941 we are delighted that the university has agreed to work collaboratively with us on this venture
2621942 the assistance that we have received from the university convinces us that this partnership will return great rewards for both sides better players for the steelers and many new bright and intelligent students for the university
2621943 there is a growing demand for this kind of browser based application particularly in universities in tend s complete product is not only extremely accessible but it also delivers substantial time and cost savings
2621944 we are delighted to have received support from the centre of procurement excellence who has given the university its full backing in acquiring the in tend software on behalf of the public sector
2621945 previous attempts to find better ways of encouraging skin cell growth have used chemical additives and other elaborate techniques to produce scaffolds but their success has been limited we ve found that skin cells are actually very smart it s in their dna to sort themselves into the right arrangement they just need a comparatively uncomplicated scaffold and each other to help them grow in a safe natural way
2621946 ultimately we can envisage treatment of burns victims and the undertaking of reconstructive surgery using the scaffold and the patient s own skin to produce bespoke skin for that patient
2621947 synthesis processing and characterisation of peptide containing block co polymers for skin reconstruction
2621948 this really is a discovery of huge significance for the history of british cinema for many years we have known by looking at catalogues and contemporary evidence that birt acres arrest of a pickpocket was the first fiction film ever made in the uk but until now it was assumed that it hadnt survived the restoration work being carried out on this and the other historic films means that we will be able to enjoy these fascinating films within the context of the fairground entertainments they were part of
2621949 the family are thrilled its a wonderful discovery to know that these films are being preserved for posterity and that future generations will be able to watch them
2621950 were really excited about this installation which has been undertaken as a live project an educational initiative which aims to get our architecture students working on live projects with a range of clients including local community groups charities health organisations and regional authorities
2621951 remembering the river gives school children and members of the local community a chance to interact with and understand the real environmental issues facing london we hope that lots of people come along throughout the course of the week to create temporary sand buildings which will change the face of the installation as they decay as the days pass
2621952 the research will allow five major universities to work together for the first time on improving the care of cancer patients to and nearing the end of life as well as their families this is a very exciting development for researchers clinicians cancer patients and their families
2621953 this project has been an inspiration to both the teacher and the learner all the pupils i interviewed were extremely positive about this new way of working and knowledgeable about a wide range of topics from the pakistan disaster in muzaffarabad to the miners strikes in south yorkshire
2621954 when i asked the children what they thought of the new scheme one answered you get to say what you think and feel and they listen to you not only was i enthused by this response but it clearly sums up the positive feeling of both the children and the teachers in the school
2621955 kingstone is a successful school in terms of student behaviour and attainment but our pupils appeared to be under achieving in terms of their potential
2621956 a large majority of pupils can get turned off by schooling and are not inspired to learn this is often down to an over prescriptive curriculum with too much content overload which tends to encourage passive learning and allows insufficient space for pupils own interests this new scheme however promotes an active learning approach within the school and allows the children to be creative despite the constraints of the education system
2621957 for nearly two centuries steel has been the fundamental building block of modernity revolutionising the lives of millions from its use in building and construction in weapons production to its role in the home kitchen the transformative power of steel is undeniable as china and india race to modernise their economies with imported steel many cities across europe and north america are still struggling to cope with the transition from productive to consumptive economies
2621958 the legacies of steel economies are all around us within a uk context we have tended to shy away from our industrial past and indeed present while focusing heavily on the service sector we can learn much from the examples from europe and beyond as to how we harness the immense capital which our steel based past has left to us to revitalise communities reinvigorate landscapes strengthen local economies and retain a sense of place the focus of this conference is upon the ways in which economies and societies lives landscapes and relationships have been and continue to be transformed by steel
2621959 there is much we can learn from the simple solutions ants have found for complex problems ants have been solving these problems for millions of years while we humans have only just started to need to this research provides a gateway to understanding and investigating major questions in science which will have major benefits to humans
2621960 the summer science exhibition is a celebration of the first class research undertaken in the uk the exhibition is a fascinating opportunity to experience first hand the latest developments in science engineering and technology and talk to scientists working at the forefront of scientific research i hope the exhibition will enthuse the public as well as scientists and provide inspiration for the next generation considering a career in science
2621961 im delighted to have been given the edward heath award by the royal geographical society in recognition of the work ive carried out in and based on europe over the past three decades there is a huge job to do explaining what happens on the european mainland to a british audience in dealing with a whole range of issues within contemporary britain such as social exclusion housing policy or refugee integration there is a lot we can learn from how similar problems have been dealt with on the other side of the channel
2621962 im delighted to welcome our colleagues from the czech republic to sheffield for the presentation of our studys initial findings which promise to be very interesting this research has given us new insights into the lives health and ancestry of these early farming pioneers whats more they seem to have adopted agricultural techniques locally rather than importing them from the east as was previously thought if we can conclusively prove this to be the case it will be a major discovery in our understanding of how farming spread across europe in the early neolithic period
2621963 im delighted that our icoss building has been internationally recognised at the green apple awards 2006 the icoss buildings fantastic environmentally friendly design has made it a landmark new building on sheffields campus and an exciting building to work in

2621966 passion play and the everyday oral history and the consumer society
2621967 it has been convenient for the government and the gas and electricity regulator ofgem to blame other european countries for the behaviour of uk gas prices when in fact the causes are more home grown
2621968 im thrilled and honoured that my work has been recognised in this way and i look forward to being able to serve the royal society in their important work on behalf of british science
2621969 i am absolutely thrilled to have won this award as its something i have been working towards for a long time when i look down the list of previous winners i can only hope my career might follow a similar path having come to singing from a somewhat unorthodox route
2621970 this is a fantastic day for all the pupils involved the festivals provide the perfect opportunity for schoolchildren to learn about chemistry whilst having fun we hope that the day inspires the children to take an active interest in the subject and quite possibly become the chemists and scientists of the future
2621971 im delighted that such a high profile representative of the cbi will be attending our managing directors club meeting this week ian mccaffertys extensive knowledge of the british economy and his understanding of the issues affecting british firms now and in the future will provide the basis for a keynote address to our members which will be invaluable and insightful
2621972 most people do not realize they have oral cancer until the cancer is well advanced which can make treatment long and costly there has been no improvement in survival rates among oral cancer patients for over 4 decades and recent studies show that the incidence of the disease is increasing one of the key ways we can try and reverse this trend is to improve detection of lesions while they are small which can be achieved with maximum cost efficiency during routine check ups
2621973 the university of sheffield is proud to host trevor pinnock and the european brandenburg ensemble this summer for a residency which will highlight sheffield as a cultural centre for classical music it will be a fitting way to launch this groundbreaking new project by a highly renowned conductor and musician who is an honorary graduate of the university of sheffield
2621974 bazz puts a tremendous effort into raising funds for charity and he has been holding events at goodwin sports centre for many years the sports centre has strong football connections and therefore in this the year of the world cup we saw a good opportunity to work together and raise funds for such a worthwhile cause
2621975 we would not have been able to raise this amount without the support of goodwin sports centre and the place at broomhill who kindly sponsored the event and provided post match refreshments help on all three days was also provided by elizabeth edwards our resident scorekeeper and patrick cunningham and company from abbeydale park grange school
2621976 in the centre for stem cell biology at the university we have actively been deriving new human embryonic stem cell lines for eventual application in human medicine
2621977 the collaboration with ucl and moorfields provides an exciting and groundbreaking opportunity to further investigate whether these cells can be used for treating a disease which so far has no alternative therapy available
2621978 it is the first time anyone has shown how susceptible the ozone shield is to damage by halogen release from these massive bouts of ancient volcanism the results give us a deeper understanding of environmental change during the largest mass extinction of all time at the end of the permian period
2621979 the study shows the power of integrating ideas from across different scientific disciplines to open up exciting new avenues of research as we continue to adopt this approach further surprising new discoveries from earth history are sure to await us
2621980 if accurate this technology may reduce the number of miscarriages of justice in the legal system however it is a double edged sword as participants may not receive the result that they are hoping for
2621981 we are really pleased to be involved in the organisation of the annual millhouses park festival as students at the university it is great to be able to make our own contribution to the local community
2621982 last year s event attracted 5000 visitors this year s student committee is dedicated to making the event better than ever so as to raise even more money to help local children
2621983 i have always been interested in volunteering and giving something back to the city in which i live and study the pro uno scheme offers me the unique opportunity to use the skills i have gained at university to help a group of people who often find it difficult to understand legal jargon and more importantly their rights
2621984 we are hoping that in the future if we get sponsorship from a local law firm we will be able to help other charities and give more students the opportunity to get involved in this project
2621985 we are delighted that students from the university of sheffield are giving up their free time to help us because we only have limited funds and resources the work that the students have done for us has meant we can help even more people in the local community i am very grateful to all those students involved for their support and hard work and i hope over time we can expand the service further
2621986 the pro uno scheme is a great example of how we can utilise the huge pool of skills and experience at the university to benefit the local community i am extremely proud of the staff and students involved in this scheme and i wish it every success in the future
2621987 the wrcetle in sheffield has already helped several student businesses to start up and is providing practical advice and training to many students in all faculties the enterprise zone will provide the university with a presence on campus and a base from which we can engage with more students staff and external partners
2621988 it is important for the university and the business world to interact together an environment like this will allow that interaction and there is nothing more important for a new entrepreneur than to gain from the knowledge of those more experienced
2621989 our ambition is to help every student make an impact in the future as a social entrepreneur enterprising employee or successful business owner
2621990 i am delighted that the management school has obtained accreditation from the association of mbas amba this is an international benchmark that validates the global standard of our mba programme and represents an important step in the building of a world class management school at the university of sheffield
2621991 recent food scares have fuelled public concerns about food and farming consumers find it difficult to know where their food comes from how it is produced and how far it has travelled through the voices of food producers cookery writers food campaigners and consumers we hope that food stories will provide a fascinating and timely resource to answer some of these questions in an easily accessible format

2622003 we are really looking forward to meeting martin and hearing about some of his amazing stories as a relatively new society we are always looking for new members and i hope that such a high profile unicef campaigner on campus talking about his work will encourage more people to join us in raising awareness of children s rights and global issues
2622004 we are very excited about the potential for this product and about the fact that this could save lives
2622005 i hope people take the opportunity to go and see the display at the science museum and hopefully in the future it will be more than just a prototype but will be a real product used in life or death situations
2622006 my engineering education at the university of sheffield gave me a solid foundation to tackle the most technically demanding design challenges and the faculty s enthusiasm for engineering business and entrepreneurship gave me not only the skills but also the confidence to pursue my goal of starting my own company the faculty mentors that i met during my time at sheffield continue to provide support encouragement and advice even though i have long since graduated
2622007 by providing more people with handcycles and other alternative sporting equipment i hope to allow persons with all levels of ability to interact as equals and athletes and in that way change some of the social preconceptions and misconceptions about ability and disability
2622008 we are extremely proud of graham and his achievements i strongly believe that as educators we have the responsibility of providing students with the opportunities to use their engineering skills in projects where their solutions can benefit society more directly i am delighted that graham has used the knowledge and skills gained at the university to help more people with disabilities and wish him every success with his new company

2622012 i am very pleased i have won this award ever since i was a child i have wanted to learn but due to conflict in my country it was difficult to do this i am very grateful to the university for giving me this opportunity to learn and meet new friends i hope with my qualifications i can become a qualified interpreter and maybe one day return to afghanistan and help rebuild my country
2622013 our production explores issues and emotions aroused by the idea of human cloning
2622014 phantom sita is based on the famous hindu epic ramayana sita is a central character in ramayana the phantom sita the clone of sita is based on a novel interpretation of a particular episode in ramayana by mr vettam mani the episode depicted in our dance performance centres on ravana s abduction of the cloned sita she experiences a range of emotions sitting under the banyan tree in ashoka vana where she has been confined by her captor the hindu view on cloning is that even if two beings are genetically identical their destinies will be different their karma will be different the phantom sita feels immense happiness as she perceives her creation as fulfilling a noble cause but at the same time she feels immense sadness since she knows nothing but sorrow in life she was created to fulfil a particular purpose and she struggles to understand the situation she is in on the other hand agni the creator an analogy to the scientist engaged in cloning research is thrilled with the outcome but also plagued by a dilemma concerning his creation
2622015 the map is important from a scientific point of view but also holds interest for people wanting to see how the glacier affected the landscape where they live
2622016 glaciers are extremely important to climate change because we now know that ice sheets can actively change ocean circulation and climate over a short timescale
2622017 if we can better understand how ice sheet behaviour has affected past climate then we can better predict future climate change
2622018 it s fantastic that people seeking refuge in sheffield have got to know the city s beautiful green areas they provide a place to relax socialise and play sport and crucially they re free enjoying the parks really helps newcomers to settle in sheffield

2622027 we are also looking forward to welcoming the team from saudi arabia and hope that they have an enjoyable stay in sheffield and make some new friends along the way
2622028 this is a fantastic opportunity for local firms to ensure that they retain the best legal brains in the region national firms have the opportunity to choose from the cream of the region s talent and judging by previous years this event is sure to be a huge success for employers and students alike
2622029 completing a genome sequence for a species is only half the battle once this is completed you are left with the task of actually finding the genes themselves which make up only a fraction of the whole sequence
2622030 genes produce a substance called messenger rna mrna which turn into proteins that our bodies can use our work involved generating thousands of mrna sequences which then helped to determine where the genes are on the chromosomes and what proteins they encode
2622031 this work is hugely important for both agriculture and biomedical scientists and allows researchers to fill an important evolutionary gap between the genome sequences of fish and mammals that have already been determined
2622032 as one of the biggest employers in sheffield the university takes very seriously its responsibility for leading by example this award is welcome recognition that we ve translated best practice policies on minimising environmental emissions and promoting efficient use of energy resources into practice at local regional national and international levels
2622033 i m delighted that the university has received this recognition of its achievements in environmental management the award will provide an excellent benchmark for us in the future it has been earned through the individual and collective efforts and commitment of many staff across the university and it highlights the significant contribution the university makes to improving the environment for the city of sheffield and the wider community
2622034 this is a unique and vital initiative to preserve our theatrical heritage thousands of plays are simply lost to future generations each year students theatre workers writers cultural and social historians will all benefit from an archive which is both comprehensive and accessible i sincerely congratulate the university in developing this project
2622035 until 1968 the lord chamberlain was responsible for licensing drama
2622036 jack reading then secretary for society of theatre research realised that the new order meant that there was now no central store for scripts
2622037 unfortunately the amendment is not very well known and even if it were 5 isnt much of an incentive in addition it isnt clear who exactly is responsible for submitting the scripts so it often doesnt happen
2622038 this is a huge project for example there are 5000 shows performed each year at the edinburgh festival hardly any of these are deposited at the british library and we are in danger of losing an important part of our artistic heritage
2622039 the aim of the project is to encourage people to submit their scripts old and new to the archive they obviously wont be fined but they will be preserving and conserving the work for future generations
2622040 we are looking forward to reaping the literary rewards from this fruitful collaboration with sheffield and trust that theatres nationwide will help us to track down copies of the missing playscripts which are such an important aspect of our cultural heritage and an invaluable resource for researchers in this area
2622041 some ants find their way by following pheromone trails rather than by using sight the ants should move away from the nest when they are foraging and back towards it when they are laden with food but the pheromone trail leaves no way of knowing in which direction the ants are travelling
2622042 we found that it isn t the pheromones themselves that determine direction but the angles that they are laid in the trails are laid at 60 degree angles across the whole network this means that the ants can tell which way they are going along any trail in the network
2622043 this was a genuine collaboration between computer science and biology we in computer science have expertise in modelling complex systems including biological ones and the approach we took was strongly influenced by this in fact the project is a good example of what is being called systems biology a rapidly growing and highly fashionable area by looking at the whole system in this case the ant community we try to understand how all the parts fit together into a working system
2622044 there have been many theories about how ants follow trails including one by richard feynman a well known physicist
2622045 he proposed that the ants left three different pheromones one after the other so that the ants could distinguish direction by the order of the pheromones in the trail
2622046 the actual mechanism is remarkably simple and demonstrates that sometimes the best solutions are the simplest
2622047 nothing beats getting into the real world and finding out what it is like working in a busy practice it s a very positive experience it builds confidence and gives you space to grow into your new role
2622048 giving students a positive experience in the nhs early in their training is vitally important to future nhs services and is creating interest in these services as a career option
2622049 together with other developments outreach has enabled the school to triple the number of hygiene and therapy students on the course and substantially increase the number of dental students we take in each year but it s not just about numbers this will undoubtedly help to build a dental workforce better prepared to meet the needs of local communities
2622050 this project would not have been possible without the skill and dedication of the staff of the nhs dental services in doncaster rotherham barnsley sheffield and the dearne valley
2622051 this is a ray of hope after all those stories of people having difficulty finding a dentist while it is no quick fix this approach has produced newly qualified dental staff who are more confident more experienced and better able to understand patients needs
2622052 unlike rival guides that take an historical view discovering cities sheffield reviews the developments the city has seen to its fabric and infrastructure over the last decade and looks ahead to its future prospects ive set out to put contemporary changes in the city into their social political historic and economic context so i think the guide will offer local readers an intriguing new insight into their home city how it came to be the way it is and where its heading
2622053 our study involved using airborne laser surveys to measure the height of the ice in greenland we found that ice is thinning at an extremely rapid rate along the margins meaning that greenland s contribution to global sea level rise has almost doubled since the mid 90s
2622054 in contrast to this ice in south east greenland has actually thickened by a metre between 2002 and 2003 reversing the thinning of between 10cm and 40cm a year which had been occurring there in the mid 90s
2622055 these findings add to the current debate over how global warming will affect ice in greenland warm air holds more water than cold air so global warming means we may have a wetter climate storm tracks could move further north with more snow falling on greenland this snowfall could offset the melting that is taking place on other parts of the ice sheet
2622056 the development of state of the art student accommodation at our endcliffe ranmoor stephenson and crewe sites is integral to our plans to provide modern desirable accommodation for our students respectful of the needs of communities in the city
2622057 last months public exhibition gave us an invaluable insight into the views needs and priorities of the local community and we were delighted by the level of positive interest in our proposals
2622058 the consultation has enabled us to integrate public views into our proposals particularly with regard to issues such as design building materials transport security and the location of family accommodation
2622059 in the light of comments received during the exhibition we have also recently announced the introduction of uniformed litter patrols on and around university sites
2622060 our student residences strategy will benefit students communities and the city as a whole and this application takes us closer to realising this aim
2622061 this is a real breakthrough in the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa and other diseases that lead to blindness we found that not only did the stem cells encourage new retinal cells to grow they also helped to protect those cells that were still present
2622062 we were able to see that the treated mice could see light as mice are naturally photophobic meaning that they stop their normal activity when they detect light this natural response allowed us to easily demonstrate that the stem cells had restored vision
2622063 this is only a first step but it is extremely encouraging and we hope that this research will lead to a number of stem cell therapies for treating blindness
2622064 as a significant generator of traffic within the city the university has a responsibility to encourage good environmental practice and to do its bit to improve the air quality for sheffield s people
2622065 this initiative is just one part of a wider environmental policy to ensure that the university adopts a responsible approach to protecting the environment we will always strive to reduce the release of pollutants and today s announcement is part of our emerging environmentally sound transport strategy
2622066 the uk and international higher education landscape is changing at an unprecedented rate and it s vital that british universities are governed in a way that equips them to be alert and responsive to changing market conditions while still remaining true to the core principles ethics and values of higher education that s a major challenge for university councils and boards of governors that exercise ultimate responsibility for an institution s activities this conference will discuss a number of issues they need to understand if they are to meet that challenge successfully
2622067 methane is an easy gas to look for as it leaves a negative isotope trail behind meaning that we can detect a methane release event in sediments from any given era
2622068 when we examined sediments from across the paleocene eocene boundary we found that methane had left a far bigger signature behind in sediments on land than in the sea this effect was replicated across several continents our challenge was to explain why this amplification on land had occurred
2622069 methane s geochemical signature would only be higher in terrestrial sediments if plants had had more water available to them either from the air in water vapour or due to increased rainfall
2622070 the relevance of this research for today is that we are currently going through a similar process of gradual global warming to that that occurred during the paleocene eocene
2622071 scientists predicting the future effects of climate change rely upon computer models since we have never lived through this kind of change before however by looking back to what has happened in the past we can better predict and test our models of future climatic change
2622072 we have recorded some really interesting recollections that will allow researchers of today and the future to understand more about the rich and varied performances and culture within british theatre during the post war years
2622073 the voice recordings are an effective way of capturing the enthusiasm and excitement of the interviewees and make for fascinating listening new perspectives from theatregoers will help to re interrogate this crucial period in british theatre history
2622074 the book recounts the period between 1824 and 1968 when the lord chamberlain s office read every new play to censor any unfavourable or corrupting content it contains extensive extracts from the written archives of the office and offers a unique insight into the morality of the time
2622075 it is incredible the uproar that was cause by plays which we now think of as some of the finest world
2622076 thanks to the human genome project we know the instructions that govern the structure of membrane proteins but those instructions are written in code we still know very little about the way that code is used to build a three dimensional shape
2622077 at the moment the effectiveness of drugs that target membrane proteins is a totally hit and miss affair but once weve discovered a proteins three dimensional shape we have much more information to help us design a drug to bind on to it creating a powerful drug which can cling to and modify its target protein really efficiently
2622078 we re very pleased to be joining forces with bedford school and other schools in the area to enable school students to experience something of the excitement of scientific discovery and encourage them to study the sciences tony ryan is an inspirational teacher as well as a world class research scientist so i m sure the students who take part in the seminar will have a really memorable day
2622079 the need for effective links between schools and universities is undeniable and the problem with the supply of scientists mathematicians and engineers is clear the end result of tackling both issues in a modern and effective way could be valuable educationally if a pilot phase is successful an expansion of the scheme could easily follow and should do so
2622080 the beauty of video conferencing links is that distance between participants schools and providers universities is not a problem
2622081 we at mayfield are pleased to have brought together the department of information studies at sheffield and pricewaterhousecoopers to work with us on this important and worthwhile project
2622082 this good university guide online prototype has been delivered on time and to spec and we are delighted with the outcome the project itself has been a model of collaboration with all three parties playing a crucial role in its development to date miguel nunes and rob polding are to be congratulated on their contribution to an online interactive facility which has the potential to help thousands of university applicants their parents teachers and careers counsellors both here and overseas
2622083 as the uk s number one graduate recruiter we are delighted to support gug online it will be of enormous help not only to university applicants but also to their parents and teachers in making crucial decisions about their futures and as one of the world s leading professional services firms we see this interactive website as a significant tool in bringing the diversity of british universities more in focus for students in other countries
2622084 we are delighted that heledd s work has been recognised with such a prestigious award which she thoroughly deserves her work has been of a continually high standard and she also completed an excellent project during a year of study in spain
2622085 we are proud to have heledd as one of our students and are sure she has a bright future ahead of her
2622086 i was thrilled to be shortlisted never mind to win the award and the ceremony itself was wonderful my tutor and project supervisor at sheffield have been fantastic and their support has been invaluable
2622087 lets give them something to talk about how bout love
2622088 do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs that it may benefit those who listen
2622089 this is a prestigious award that recognises the quality of our research and will allow us to further develop this work without the constraints sometimes caused by bidding for funding for each individual project
2622090 as well as the epsrc grant we have already gained an additional half a million pounds in industrial sponsorship the work of our team should lead to the development of innovative new materials that out perform those we have at the moment
2622091 this project combines our growing experience in building multi unit accommodation with our long track record in the pfi market
2622092 our previous successes in pfi healthcare and education have certainly been an asset in bidding for this scheme but to win it we had to demonstrate value and quality combined with a design that is in scale and style with its surroundings
2622093 this major project is a demonstration of the university s commitment to our students by improving our existing accommodation and building new facilities we will consolidate and strengthen the university s international status attracting students staff and investment in both the university and the city
2622094 both english and german commentators have developed linguistic solutions to the way they deal with the time pressures in live radio football commentary formulaic language is not used to express clich s about football but instead is used to enable the quick expression of thoughts leaving more time for immediate expression or more vital information this is not a sign of laziness or sloppiness but rather a direct consequence of the communicative setting in which the language is produced
2622095 were delighted to be able to bring the historic victorian wing of the old jessop hospital back into daily use following the universitys acquisition of this key site in the centre of our campus we now have the chance to provide our staff and students with outstanding facilities in iconic buildings both historic and newly built whats more as our proposals include plans for some commercial premises on site which will be open to the public we will be able to open up and regenerate this central key site for everyone in the city
2622096 alan brown has made an absolutely irreplaceable contribution to the music department and the university and community more generally over more than three decades he has an enviable reputation as an editor and performer of early english keyboard music but alongside those research activities he is also a teacher and performer who will be sorely missed in the department generations of students have benefited from his expertise knowledge and practical understanding and his mild mannered and modest personality have endeared him to all who have had the privilege of working studying and playing music with him
2622097 as well as being visually attractive the sculpture illustrates some key scientific features of fullerenes which children love to call buckyballs
2622098 i am delighted to be unveiling this molecule in 2006 the year of the world cup
2622099 today the sculpture stands outside the kroto research institute as a fitting emblem highlighting the importance of the nanoscience and nanotechnology research being undertaken in the institute and the exciting promise of these cutting edge research areas for combating the major socio economic and humanitarian issues such as environmental remediation remedial medicine and advanced materials that now confront us
2622100 it is a great honour for us to have sir harry unveiling this statue at such an exciting time in the development of the university s kroto research institute and north campus
2622101 we are already seeing how the collaboration of the twenty or so different disciplines from across the sciences engineering and medical faculties is accelerating research and opening up new and exciting areas a common interest throughout our research at the kroto research institute is the development of fundamental new understanding of behaviour at nanoscale dimensions and how it can be tailored to improve macroscopic performance the elegant giant buckyball sculpture is an iconic symbol of this farsighted philosophy
2622102 our work clearly points to the fact that any non uniformity of design of soccer balls or asymmetry of manufacture will have a dramatic effect on the side forces of the ball when there s little or no spin applied to it and hence its swerve through the air
2622103 we believe that our findings go a long way to explain the phenomenon observed when some players kick the ball with little or no spin yet get it to swerve in a seemingly erratic manner possibly producing an s shape trajectory
2622104 as a soccer player i feel this research is invaluable in order for players to be able to optimise their kicking strategies this knowledge could further be utilised by manufacturers to design future balls which will ultimately enhance the overall experience for players and spectators at all levels of the game
2622105 it is becoming more and more obvious that the aerodynamic performance of a soccer ball is very closely linked to its design and manufacture as witnessed by these initial sheffield studies dr carr s work is clearly pointing towards modern computer based simulation techniques permitting us to model any kick of any ball this will open up whole new directions for the design and development of soccer balls
2622106 we are delighted to welcome the students from city college to the university the management school and the college have a longstanding relationship and as a result the annual business competition has been incredibly successful in past years this year promises to be no different and i am looking forward to seeing the ideas behind both teams business ventures
2622107 it is strange that the germ theory did not catch on during the 1840s when it was promoted by men of the scientific quality of mantell and holland especially considering the latter s influential standing clearly pasteur s significant contribution was in to systematically use experiments to prove the truth of these earlier theories
2622108 children who have suffered bereavement can experience a lack of confidence fears and insecurity about relationships and loss in future as well as issues at school the ants project is a great opportunity to bring children who have has similar experiences together to make friends and have fun in a supportive environment
2622109 innovation and competitive developments in british manufacturing have tended to focus on designing high value products this new grant that we have received through heif will enable us to develop brand new ways of assembling those products which make the most of intelligent systems and computerised technologies to give our british manufacturers a real edge in the demanding global marketplace
2622110 the sports day at the university is a great opportunity for our school pupils to play different sports on a soft surface in a nice wide open space instead of their usual concrete playground the student volunteers are fantastic at coaching providing the pupils with a brilliant day of fun and sport
2622111 the annual sports day has proved immensely successful we aim to show that every child whatever their ability can do well and have fun whilst learning new skills the student volunteers provide lots of noisy encouragement and make sure each child has a chance to shine
2622112 we already know that three fifths of women in the uk are employed in just ten occupations while at the same time there are huge skill shortages in numerous sectors where women are not usually employed
2622113 our research has shown that much can be done to rectify this situation and that government and key agencies have a crucial role to play in changing the attitudes of employers and women so that more people are able to fulfil their full potential these changes would bring enormous benefits for employers and the economy as well as give many more women the chance to do the work they enjoy and aspire to
2622114 coming from lucknow to sheffield as a student was a really big step for me i was the first person in my family to go to university outside of india and moving to sheffield was a daunting step to take but i have had a fantastic time both living and studying in such a friendly wonderful city as sheffield
2622115 whats more i dont think many young people in india realise that there is so much more to studying in the uk than just academic courses and exams my involvement with the students union in sheffield has given me invaluable experience of leadership and management skills which i hope will enable me to go on to study for an mba at harvard once ive completed my degree at sheffield
2622116 this house believes diversity action contributes nothing to the universitys success
2622117 our first ever diversity day for staff gives us a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the culturally diverse staff community at the university our programme of seminars workshops and information drop ins will provide all of our staff with the chance to get involved and find out more about how understanding diversity can benefit everyone at the university
2622118 receiving this award will enable us to develop a commercial application for this groundbreaking technology using ultrasound technology means we can look inside machines for faults and damage linked to lubrication without damaging the machines themselves this really is an important breakthrough in engineering precision components and im looking forward to taking it out into industry
2622119 its great to get both beatriz and pete in sheffield for this concert which will be a real celebration of electroacoustic music in the 21st century electroacoustic performances are unique experiences quite unlike going to see a traditional orchestra and im sure that this concert and the workshop that follows it will be a real treat for fans of the genre and a great introduction for newcomers
2622120 mrsa is difficult to treat due to the increase of resistance towards antibiotics which are currently being used in uk hospitals this has led to renewed efforts to develop a vaccine against the infection and as our research has shown potentially nasal carriage as well
2622121 the current emphasis on tackling hygiene in hospitals is very important but should be viewed as part of a larger strategy if we are to eliminate the huge human tragedy and financial burden of mrsa development of a vaccine will be a crucial part in achieving this goal
2622122 it is very fitting that our students will be escorting the memorial lamp this year as the procession reaches the altar the lamp is passed through a staff nurse a ward sister and a lecturer to the presiding minister who this year is the archbishop of canterbury this signifies the passing on of the lamp of knowledge this is an excellent occasion and i am delighted our students have been given the opportunity to be a part of it
2622123 i am delighted to support the university of sheffield s international art exhibition this is a wonderfully innovative project the centrepiece arts exhibition by some of the best contemporary artists provides a bridge between britain and france the university and its city
2622124 the immensely rich vibrant and diverse cultures of the french speaking world are nowhere more evident than among contemporary artists whom we are delighted to play host to in this trail blazing international collaboration this exhibition promises to be a landmark in the developing ambitions of the university our partners and the city of sheffield
2622125 arts council england is pleased to support the university engaging with and contributing to sheffields vibrant cultural sector working alongside cupola gallery the university will show the works of international contemporary artists while developing new partnerships and new collaborations our investment in the arts and our support for the creation of partnerships is important for the regions economic success and channel is very much part of this
2622126 we tend to forget that in many countries of the world women could expect until recently to live fewer years than men and that maternal death in particular remains a big killer
2622127 we must remember though that life expectancy data apply from birth onwards so the picture would be different in some countries if life expectancy from conception was considered
2622128 but even the life expectancy from birth may not be a permanent achievement given that the largest remaining untapped market for cigarettes in the world is made up of women living in poorer countries
2622129 im absolutely thrilled that weve earned this accolade its a just reflection of the way that the dedication creativity and sheer hard work of our outstandingly talented team has borne fruit in support of the universitys overall priorities and objectives given that were a relatively young department established just three years ago its quite some achievement to already be ranked at the head of our field
2622130 im extremely pleased that our marketing team has received this national recognition of their success
2622131 im delighted to welcome sir peter middleton to the university of sheffield for the annual sheffield management lecture sir peters wealth of management experience in the public sector and with barclays bank makes him an ideal speaker for this event and im sure that his professional background will provide our audience with plenty of interesting insights into the changing face of management in the uk
2622132 sheffield hallam university is delighted to join forces with the university of sheffield to bring such high profile individuals to the city the lecture is a key event in the regional business calendar giving guests the opportunity to learn from leaders of successful organisations and debate issues facing business over the years it has proved to be stimulating and informative regularly attracting more than 300 decision makers and senior managers we look forward to hearing from sir peter middleton at this years event
2622133 im delighted to be visiting seoul to deliver this lecture which will give an insight into the current role of the state in global politics spending time in seoul will also enable me to meet with local students and academic staff and to build on the already substantial cultural and academic links between the university of sheffield and south korea
2622134 the last decade has witnessed a massive expansion of the surveillance capacity of the state in its efforts to reduce crime and offending
2622135 the ever rising deployment of surveillance technology is having a profound effect on how policing and crime control are carried out
2622136 these developments undoubtedly reflect contemporary concerns with terrorism identity theft and anti social behaviour but rather than unquestioningly accepting the effectiveness of new technological fixes to the problem of crime we need to critically access their impact and effectiveness
2622137 this is an amazing experience for everyone involved it is a unique journey in which you get to see some of europe s finest cities make new friends along the way as well as raise money for such worthwhile charities
2622138 its great to have been able to give such young children the opportunity to work alongside university researchers in our labs the seeing red project is allowing me to work closely with curbar school to give these pupils an insight into the work of university engineers which will hopefully inspire some of them to consider careers in science and engineering when theyre older
2622139 until recently scientists have focused on the threat of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in europe and north america partially since these were the first areas of the world to receive high levels of this pollutant however our work shows that atmospheric nitrogen deposition is becoming a global threat
2622140 scientists know very little about the sensitivity of the hotspot ecosystems to nitrogen deposition so accurate estimates of the amount of likely species loss are not possible understanding the impacts of n deposition in hotspots is therefore a priority for future research
2622141 i m not a stamp collector and had never really given the subject much thought until i came across a stamp from iraq
2622142 the stamp had a picture of saddam hussein s face in a heart and said on it in english
2622143 my area of research is japan so i began looking into east asian stamps to see if there was anything of interest in their national stamps one recent example is seen in a territorial dispute between japan and south korea over an island called takeshima japanese tokdo south korean in the sea of japan in january 2004 the south korean government issued a stamp depicting tokdo and implying it was clearly within south korean boundaries it had previously done this in the 1950s when to add insult to injury the stamp was the exact price of a letter going from seoul to tokyo ensuring that they flooded japan
2622144 the uk is the only country in the world that doesn t need to display the name of the county on its stamps this is because stamps were invented in britain and the queen s silhouette acts as a symbol for a british stamp
2622145 in the 1960s tony benn made a move to get the queen s head removed from british stamps which the queen herself agreed to however the palace were unhappy with the decision and the change was never made
2622146 this find represents the most richly carved ceiling in the whole of cave art and shows a number of new themes and techniques it also demonstrates that cave art is spread across a much wider geographical area than we originally thought
2622147 we saw the figures during sunny mornings when the cave was illuminated by a brilliant reflected light which is how i presume they were supposed to be viewed this type of carving is extremely rare on cave ceilings and is a significant find
2622148 the people who lived in creswell crags some 13 000 years ago have quite literally carved out its place in prehistory the present and indeed the future
2622149 the sound waves on the sun s surface are usually damped before they reach the atmosphere
2622150 we measured the waves at the surface of the sun and applied our model to try to predict when spicules would shoot up and were pleased to find that the model predicts them well
2622151 now we know how spicules are formed scientists will be able to research them more thoroughly and start examining if and how much they contribute to the solar wind
2622152 the university faces many challenges in seeking to provide safe and appealing accommodation for our students whilst respecting the needs of local communities and the environment in which we operate
2622153 the student residences strategy does just this in a sustainable and deliverable way that will not only benefit the university and those who choose to study with us but also local communities and the economy of sheffield as a whole
2622154 this week we issued a brochure outlining the key elements of the strategy and are now entering into a process of consultation with local people a key element of this will be next week s exhibition where we will to discuss the strategy in person with many local people
2622155 we are keen to hear the views of local people on this matter which is of crucial importance to the future of the university and the local area
2622156 embryonic stem cells are special because they are able to differentiate and potentially become any cell in the body the science is fairly new but harnessing their abilities could allow us to develop therapies for a wide range of degenerative conditions
2622157 the centre for stem cell biology is focussing on producing embryonic stem cells that have been produced under strict regulations ensuring that they could be used for clinical cell therapy in the future the symposium will allow us to discuss with other researchers the current state of knowledge of these amazing cells and provide a stepping stone towards their eventual use in human healthcare
2622158 i was brought up on a fair and when i came to write my thesis i was dismayed to find that nobody was systematically recording this way of life so that future generations could learn more about how fairs have developed and changed over the years
2622159 historically fairgrounds have been a place where new ways of thinking and living begin for example women in fairgrounds were a key part of family businesses long before it was considered normal or acceptable for women to work the fair is an important part of our cultural heritage and i felt very strongly that it ought to be preserved for future generations
2622160 i am thrilled at the success of the archive and am delighted at the speed at which it has grown both in size and reputation
2622161 the archive is well thought of both academically and by showpeople who have been wonderful at helping me to collect evidence of this fascinating way of life which has brought pleasure to millions of people throughout its history
2622162 nurses and midwives care for people in a constantly changing world
2622163 we feel very proud of the part our university has played in helping to establish and strengthen pre and post qualification nursing and midwifery educational programmes in gibraltar
2622164 the introduction of the diploma level course was a catalyst for change showing why an academic environment should be more evident in clinical settings staff in clinical areas in gibraltar have risen to that challenge thanks to the strong link between the gibraltar school of health studies gibraltar health authorities and sheffield university
2622165 this is a great opportunity for students to learn more about engineering while having fun and at the same time to come into a university environment and find out what its really like
2622166 we hope that the students enjoy their day and that for some of them it sparks and interest in learning more about science and engineering in the future
2622167 we wanted students regardless of academic ability to have their success recognised by their local university twelve schools are involved and we hold two ceremonies each year for the successful students and their parents
2622168 i am delighted to attend this awards ceremony and want to thank the university for its involvement in this programme however the most important people to thank are the pupils who have worked so hard to achieve their awards
2622169 we are delighted to welcome professor giddens to our launch and are really looking forward to hearing him speak
2622170 ordinary people in britain started to use forks in the mid 17th century before then table knives had pointed ends that were used to spear the food once it had been cut up once forks became more common the shape of table knives changed to have more rounded ends
2622171 the americans didnt get forks until around 100 years after britain but were supplied with the new round ended knives from the uk
2622172 the history of eating may seem like an odd subject for a conference but food is an integral part of our lives and as such provides a unique glimpse into the history of our forefathers
2622173 seeing myself as a scholar i was reluctant to involve myself in television when i started on robot wars in 1997
2622174 the fellowship is a fantastic opportunity and will allow me the time to develop programmes on the relationship between life and machines
2622175 photosynthesis is the single most important chemical reaction on earth and it is fascinating to see for the first time how nature has overcome the problem of harvesting and utilising solar energy
2622176 although scientists have known the structures of the individual components involved in photosynthesis for some time this is the first time we have managed to see how they all fit together and work as a system
2622177 we already knew that during photosynthesis light is collected by an antenna made up of two light harvesting complexes lh1 and lh2 and then passed to a reaction centre rc where it is converted into chemical energy
2622178 the way photosynthesis works is that groups of lh2 complexes pick up the light and pass them it around among themselves until the light comes across an lh2 complex which is touching one of the larger lh1 complexes
2622179 we found that the lh2 complexes are structured in an antenna like shape and when light is scarce they co operate by joining together to allow them to make the best possible use of the limited light available
2622180 the lh1 complexes are each attached to their own rc and from looking at the images we believe that if an lh1 takes in light whilst its reaction centre is busy then it will keep passing the energy on to neighbouring lh1 complexes until an unoccupied reaction centre is found
2622181 we hope to test this particular theory further but the purpose of both of these systems would be to maximise the efficiency of photosynthesis the process of harvesting light energy is over 95 efficient which is an incredible figure
2622182 this work doesn t only have implications for our understanding of photosynthesis but also for the future of molecular science by looking at the world on an individual molecular level scientists have the opportunity to learn more about an incredible number of biological systems and processes
2622183 i was fascinated to go to boulby mine for sky at night
2622184 this was a wonderful opportunity to show the public more about what we do and the significance of this research if we become the first scientists to find dark matter then boulby will become the centre of a discovery of world significance
2622185 we consistently found that women gained on average two extra grandchildren for every ten years that they lived past their reproductive life in evolutionary terms this gives a huge benefit as it makes it more likely that women who survive long after stopping reproduction will forward more genes to the next generation the evidence suggests that the effect is caused by the woman passing her childcare experience on to her offspring she can also take on some of the responsibilities of childcare making it more likely that her children will have more children more quickly
2622186 our conclusion is that the country is being split in half to the south is the metropolis of greater london to the north and west is the archipelago of the provinces city islands that appear to be slowly sinking demographically socially and economically on the maps shown here the uk is looking more and more like a city state it is a kingdom united only by history increasingly divided by its geography
2622187 although the internet can be of enormous benefit to people many dont take advantage of it either because they have never used a computer before or dont think that the internet has anything to offer them
2622188 the beauty of this system is that all of the information offered will be relevant to the needs of the individual avoiding frustrating searches using search engines
2622189 as well as providing personal web access we are also enabling local community groups to develop their own websites through a sister project south yorkshire community information to date over fifty groups have created their own sites with our support
2622190 this project is groundbreaking and is being watched with interest all over the uk the system could easily be replicated to provide personalised web access for every person in the uk
2622191 in recent years it has become increasingly apparent that our accommodation offer is both failing to serve students needs and is often failing to respect the needs of the wider communities within which they live the strategy we have launched today will provide modern accommodation and facilities in a setting which will preserve and enhance the environment and respect the needs of neighbouring communities
2622192 the development will provide sheffield with more sensibly located and desirable accommodation for students we welcome interest and comment on our proposals which will inform the development of our master plan
2622193 it is particularly apt that we should be celebrating ten years of search engines here as we believe that the first web search engine was british it was called jumpstation and was created in the university of stirling and released in early 1994
2622194 within five years pcs will be large enough to store everything we read write hear and see including video images and emails
2622195 mylifebits looks at how we can digitally store everything from financial records to the books we read and the songs we listen to photos telephone calls and even the web pages we have visited
2622196 this has great implications for allowing us to move to a truly paperless society but also means that trawling through swathes of our own personal data will become very difficult without an effective system in place
2622197 mylifebits works on the premise that you don t think about personal information in the same way as you do other people s data so a traditional search engine approach would be unhelpful for personal information for example you may think of a personal document in relation to the time you received it maybe around the same time as an important life changing event rather than in key words mylifebits will hopefully provide the flexibility to search in more creative ways
2622198 at the moment historical texts can only be accessed digitally as image files and searching them involves somebody inputting key search terms in a way that the computer can understand this is a time consuming and expensive process and inhibits the number of historical documents we can access electronically
2622199 we have developed a system whereby the computer learns the handwriting after you transcribe a small proportion of the pages
2622200 we have used george washington s letters to develop the system and after transcribing 100 pages of his writing the computer was able to search 987 pages of text with a much lower error rate than by using traditional handwriting recogniser
2622201 this work not only has relevance to historical works but could also eventually come into common usage so that individuals can scan and search their entire record of handwritten information for example letters lecture notes or brainstorming notes
2622202 i am delighted to have my work recognised in this way and to be in the company of the great scientists who already hold this honour
2622203 i am thrilled to be recognised as part of such a distinguished group of scientists and look forward to continuing my research and working with my colleagues to expand the boundaries of materials science
2622204 we are committed to providing our students with a choice of good quality affordable accommodation the funds raised from the sale will help us to realise this aim and to continue with further investment into teaching and academic facilities
2622205 a number of the properties for sale are a significant distance away from the university teaching buildings and have become increasingly unpopular with students
2622206 the university is now looking to the future to ensure that the range and quality of student accommodation in the city increases we have taken measures to ensure that the disposal will not affect our services in the short term whilst the new accommodation strategy is finalised and rolled out
2622207 the apple portfolio represents an excellent opportunity for investors and developers in sheffields dynamic property market we are seeking companies who can help to maximise the value of these properties
2622208 the power of the computer cluster will allow us to use real patient data to produce advanced computational models that can test a variety of hypotheses without the need to perform difficult and expensive experiments in the laboratory predictive models can be developed at all levels from gene expression to organ function
2622209 for example we can tell the computer the exact biological conditions present when a cell becomes malignant we can then produce a model of this situation so that we can see what would happen if one the conditions was altered and whether that would prevent the malignancy from occurring basing the computer inside the hospital allows us to use these techniques on patient data without compromising the security of that data
2622210 computational tools developed together with other academic partners and industry under the european funded research initiatives simbio bloodsim and gemss allow us to examine the cardiovascular system in detail and investigate how the shape of the heart and blood vessels and the speed of blood flow influence disease these models will help us to design improved medical devices and to predict how the patient could respond to treatment
2622211 the cluster will allow us working with our academic colleagues to develop new cost effective ways of treating and managing disease it demonstrates very well the benefits of nhs and university staff working as partners on research and development projects by bringing together fundamental ideas and practical concerns we can improve provision of health care to patients
2622212 this collaboration is fantastic news for progressive manufacturing the university and the region it is a prime example of how marrying cutting edge research and real manufacturing challenges can reap great rewards
2622213 amrc marks a turning point in the fortunes of south yorkshire eu funding will enable the centre to build on traditional strengths to develop leading edge technology in collaboration with world class partners and work with many more companies in the advanced manufacturing and metals cluster in south yorkshire
2622214 this collaboration between yorkshire forward and our partners visibly demonstrates the regions commitment to a thriving manufacturing sector the centre and manufacturing park are tangible examples of south yorkshires transition from dependence on large traditional industries to the development of industries which are both knowledge driven and globally competitive
2622215 boeing relies on relationships with top research institutions to provide innovative ideas
2622216 the amrc provides us with a top quality manufacturing research and development centre in europe and we are delighted to be working so closely with such an innovative and dynamic group of engineers
2622217 the first thing we did was to block the play which is where you decide on your positions on stage and practice the physical elements of the part this was really unusual for us as the modern practice is to start with the characterisation of the part then learn the lines and finally block it on stage we also worked to the time constraints that would have been part of a1950s production and have worked on a very tight timescale with fewer rehearsals than is usual for a modern production
2622218 the students have worked really hard on this project and we are proud to be able to stage the world premiere of this play in sheffield bringing this fascinating work back into the public domain has been a pleasure and i hope these will be the first performances of many
2622219 landing gear capability is world leading and is significantly enhanced by boeings investment in manufacturing technology emanating from the advanced manufacturing research centre in sheffield
2622220 i welcome this great news and congratulate messier dowty boeing the university of sheffield and all of the people involved in achieving this success the investment in the amrc has already produced world class facilities and research which will have a profound effect over the coming years
2622221 technology partnerships are the key to our future industry the advanced manufacturing research centre is demonstrating a benchmark model for the successful active collaboration between academia business and government
2622222 the award of this contract validates everything the amrc was designed to do through the efforts and cutting edge research of our engineers working hand in glove with both supply chain companies and boeing messier dowty have been able to demonstrate that they are able to lead the world in offering boeing what they need for this next generation commercial aeroplane the amrc is adding value to its collaborators through marrying the latest in research with just what is needed in a globally competitive environment
2622223 we are increasingly turning intellectual property into commercial success as urged by the chancellor and the recent lambert review this is great news for the university of sheffield but also the regional and national economy this kind of announcement is just the beginning of what can be achieved when our advanced manufacturing team work closely with top class supply chain companies
2622224 this kind of news is of great benefit to our region and will be a draw to other supply chain companies keen to enhance their competitive standing and credentials as companies drawing on the very latest and best in advanced manufacturing research sheffield and south yorkshire through the presence of the amrc and the soon to be opened advanced manufacturing park is becoming a hub for top level manufacturing with national and international status
2622225 the imaging technology in products like digital cameras and camcorders are called charged coupled devices ccd
2622226 our research teams are working on several applications including developing a new method for imaging mammograms which reduces the x ray dose needed to produce a good image the transistors in the cmos chips can be programmed to ensure that the patient is exposed to the smallest possible dose
2622227 this particular application could be in use in as little as two years in four to five years we may be able to use aps chips to provide bedside diagnostic tools that will detect cancer at the earliest possible stages being easier and faster than current body scanners
2622228 aps cameras are able to cope with images that have high contrast and this is important for scenes taken in adverse conditions we already have unique technology for seeing through fog and smoke of course this not only benefits firemen and search and rescue teams but many areas of security
2622229 these are just some of the applications for this technology and we are excited to be involved in the development of such an exciting new range of devices
2622230 if we know how a plant will react to climate change we can use this information to see how the changes will affect the animals and micro organisms that interact with that particular plant we can continue this work through the food chain until we have an idea of the effect on the whole ecosystem
2622231 our objectives were to produce frames and components that were lighter stiffer stronger and safer than those currently available and to ensure that we have a reliable supply of sufficient equipment for our growing squad the new bikes are universally praised by the riders who typically report sensations of better handling transmission of effort and ease of use
2622232 in addition to technical excellence speed of response is also vital in the high pressure world of elite sport around an olympic games
2622233 the british track cyclists will be competing in athens on bikes designed and made in the uk with the help of specialist engineering experts and we are confident that they are one of the best equipped teams at the olympics
2622234 this is a wonderful opportunity for students from across the world to see the high standard of higher education offered in the uk
2622235 i am sure that the real uk students will have a wonderful time here in sheffield
2622236 this is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate how much the uk has to offer from an academic cultural and social perspective the university has created a varied and exciting programme of events which will demonstrate not only the renowned quality of teaching which is available but also the benefits of living and learning in a place with a long and rich history of innovation and achievement
2622237 fifteen years ago osteoporosis was mainly a research subject as the causes of the condition were somewhat unknown
2622238 there were no accurate or effective diagnostic tools in use and treatment for patients was very limited
2622239 i originally trained as an endocrinologist and found i had a special interest in the way hormones affect the different parts of the body particularly the bones i decided initially to try and develop a better osteoporosis service for sheffield patients with the aim of raising awareness of the importance of the condition across other hospitals in the country
2622240 these awards represent the hard work of a strong team both from the university and the sheffield teaching hospitals trust where the clinical service is led by dr nicola peel without the dedication and support of my colleagues i could never have played my part in researching and promoting osteoporosis
2622241 i am delighted that richards hard work and dedication have been recognised by these two important awards much of his research over the years has been of direct relevance to the clinical management of patients with osteoporosis
2622242 as a consequence we have been able to introduce innovative techniques and treatments into our clinical practice at an early stage this has helped us develop as one of the leading centres in the uk
2622243 this award is a superb achievement for professor eastell and recognition of the close relationship between the university of sheffield and sheffield teaching hospitals nhs trust this joint relationship has allowed sheffield to become one of the leading world centres for researching and treating osteoporosis
2622244 in the picture were looking straight into the very creation processes of the stars and star clusters in this galaxy the clusters themselves present us with a fossil record of ngc 1569s intense star formation history
2622245 video surveillance has always been a controversial issue both in terms of disputes about its effectiveness and in terms of its civil rights implications the recent huge growth in cctv means theres never been a more opportune time to investigate the benefits disadvantages and risks by bringing together experts from a range of disciplines including criminology psychology sociology and political science among others we intend to do just that
2622246 this agreement allows us to formalise the strong relationship that we already have with these hospitals medical students spend 80 to 90 percent of the second half of their course learning in a clinical setting and these hospitals each train on average twenty students a week we are proud to be working so closely with our local hospitals
2622247 derrick has contributed to the life of the university in a variety of ways serving on a number of committees and appointment panels throughout his career he has been innovative in departmental management and his individual style has enhanced the working practices and environment of a stream of staff
2622248 we would like local organisations to put forward requests for community projects that groups of students could do in a day and make a difference just do it is about providing an easy route into volunteering we particularly want to inspire students who havent yet volunteered to get involved in their local community
2622249 we want to make sure that members of the public are aware of the project and we hope they will help us wherever possible
2622250 we hope to work together to explore ways to learn more about which local caves are of historical significance and to determine how best to conserve them for the future
2622251 the aim of the project is to introduce children to the medium of opera and help them to learn more of its artistic value
2622252 using a subject such as hansel and gretel is ideal as many of the children are already aware of the story and so can easily notice how a plot line is adapted for this style of performance
2622253 this is an excellent opportunity for both adults and children who enjoy music to experience opera in a digestible form
2622254 the whole project has been a real learning experience for all involved particularly for the children many of whom have not worked on a production of this scale before
2622255 the students felt that they had a warm welcome from the people of sheffield and wanted the opportunity to give something back to the community they will be visiting the school and taking part in a number of projects to ensure that all of the pupils gain something from the experience the students will be teaching the pupils an eid song helping them to make eid cards and finally serving them a traditional eid feast
2622256 we want to share the joy of eid with other people and as international students welcome the opportunity to interact with local people and contribute to the community
2622257 sheffield is the countrys safest large city in terms of crime rates but we hope to make it even safer student security is obviously important to us and linking into the city wide system means that this initiative benefits not only our students and the area around the university but also the citys residents and visitors over a much wider area
2622258 cycling is a great way to keep fit and get to work quickly most journeys under five miles are as quick by bike and you dont have to pay for parking so weve decided to give people at the university a bit of extra encouragement to give it a try
2622259 this is a good way for students to give something back to the communities in which they live it shows the dedication many students have to the city and is a win win situation the students get a chance to be involved in their local community and the organisations achieve a task which they may otherwise not have had the time or resources to complete
2622260 we have seen blimp 1 before as it is also used to determine the type of some white blood cells but this is the first time it has been linked to muscle development the find is particularly important because it is likely that the same switch is used in mammals fish and birds from this we can conclude that blimp 1 is a key regulator of slow twitch muscle in all animals this finding has implications for future research into how muscle genes are switched on and off and could provide new ways of manipulating the proportions of slow and fast twitch fibres in muscles
2622261 the winning website has been selected because of the simplicity of its design principles and because it manages to cater for all its target audiences it offers easy navigation and pays particular attention to children and the school curriculum
2622262 were thrilled to receive such a prestigious award the reason for putting the old bailey proceedings online was to make the records available to a wider audience so making the website highly accessible was a key priority its great to have our work recognised in such a public way
2622263 this is a great opportunity for local people to get more involved in european politics and to find out how decisions made in the european parliament affect their lives it is also an opportunity for people to make their opinions known to meps and find out more about the differing approaches of the three main parties
2622264 toxoplasma infections are especially difficult to treat because they recur the disease operates in two stages a proliferative stage and a latent stage during the proliferative stage the infection can be treated although there are many problems with available medicines but the illness then progresses to a latent stage where the cysts form that hold the parasites in a less active state these cysts are untreatable as scientists cant get medication inside the cyst the cysts eventually rupture and release proliferating parasites which can cause a recurrence of the illness if the immune system is weakened and in those with eye disease such recurrences can cause severe damage to the eye and nervous system
2622265 this discovery of the transporter is quite remarkable as no current antimicrobial compound can eliminate parasites in cysts the discovery raises the possibility of better treatments for active infection and a new approach for treating latent infection in the eye by applying a lotion containing triclosan or other antimicrobials bound to a transporter which would carry them into the eye if such treatment could eradicate the parasite in its latent form we could stop it from recurring new targets such as enoyl reductase may provide a major step forward in identifying better treatments for active disease that causes much suffering as well as loss of life
2622266 this agreement with npi ventures firmly establishes biofusion as a major player in the university commercialisation market npi ventures will strengthen both our board and investment committee and we look forward to a strong long term and profitable partnership with them
2622267 with this conference we ll be convening some of the country s most important figures to discuss the ongoing and often controversial subject of teenage parenting
2622268 it s important for us to realise that early parenthood is not synonymous with poor or bad parenting but that young people from different ethnic backgrounds often require different types of support to effectively deal with teenage parenting it is vital that service provision is flexible and able to accommodate different cultural and ethnic traditions
2622269 i m delighted that this event was such a success and that so many pupils were able to get involved and learn about engineering in such a practical hands on and enjoyable way
2622270 im delighted to be visiting tokyo to deliver this lecture which will give an insight into the current role of the state in global politics spending time in tokyo will also enable me to meet with local students and academic staff and to build on the already substantial cultural and academic links between the university of sheffield and japan
2622271 this congress is a great opportunity for some of the world s pre eminent specialists in these disputed areas to gather and share their perspectives with the general public we ll have speakers making their arguments from all sides of the debate and setting out their visions for the future of medicine in this highly contentious area
2622272 our speakers won t just be focusing on the medical and technical aspect of palliative care they ll also be taking on the moral and legal issues that make these subjects so tricky we ll be balancing the concerns of patients their families and physicians as well as discussing what protection the legal system offers to the terminally ill and the doctors who treat them i expect that our conference will make a real contribution to this ongoing debate and will help us resolve some of the complex issues and problems in this area
2622273 this evening bears witness to the richness of cultures and traditions within the university community the performances are a demonstration of the individual cultures religions and educational systems which come together to give our university the distinctive culture which makes it such a great place to study and work
2622274 these are extremely exciting findings from which we can learn a great deal about the behaviour of bacteria in the atmosphere and possibly even the beginnings of evolution on earth this research has contributed a great deal to our understanding of exactly what is going on at great heights above the surface of the planet and i expect that it will invigorate the ongoing debate over evolution
2622275 im delighted to be working with the mechanical engineering department at the university of sheffield on this project which is putting the needs of wheelchair users at the heart of future product designs dr yoxall and his students work will provide an invaluable contribution to the development of a new generation of wheelchairs
2622276 with phils support we hope to incorporate the idea of accessible design in wheelchair development phils commitment to raising awareness of access issues for disabled people will inspire the students working on this project to look for engineering solutions to real life problems and im looking forward to working with phil as the project progresses
2622277 it is a great honour for sheffield to be representing england in such a prestigious law final defeating top universities such as cambridge in the english national finals was a great moment for the students they have all worked really hard to get this far and i hope their success continues in europe
2622278 this event is an extremely useful way for regional companies to build up a real understanding of the global changes that will affect their business and think about what the future may hold it is important to think about the future in order to move business and society forward and to solve recognised global problems the dwindling supply of oil aging populations and huge levels of poverty will present massive challenges over the next few years now is the time to be thinking about these problems if we re to find any solutions
2622279 it is essential that students today leave university with a sound head for business and confidence in the world of commerce initiatives like this are an excellent way to build up those vital skills as well as give something back to the local community
2622280 by supporting student run enterprise and involving ourselves in hard nosed business we are set to become financially self sustaining and fully able to provide unique services to local organisations and groups the range of initiatives we are running reflects the existing level of imagination and flair in the team and this will continue to grow as our projects succeed
2622281 varsity is a festival of sport providing opportunities for the 52 000 students in sheffield to get involved with sporting activities it is also a great occasion for both children and adults in the local community to come together with the city s two universities for an all round celebration of sport
2622282 the idea behind varsity is to promote the value of sport and student sport in particular in sheffield varsity is a showcase of the importance of sport as a way to really unite a huge number of people behind one banner of fun fitness and passion
2622283 we re delighted to be involved with national science week for the 13th year running once again sheffield s two universities have teamed up to provide a fascinating programme of events and continue the tradition of presenting one of the largest and best science week programmes in the country with such a broad mix of activities we ll be able to provide something of interest for everyone and i expect this year s science week to be a total success for everyone involved
2622284 im delighted to welcome the young people from westfield school to the department to an event that should be interesting and inspiring
2622285 staff here at the university of sheffield carry out cutting edge research into genes and genetic diseases and i hope that their visit to our labs and lecture theatres will encourage some of the westfield school pupils to consider future careers in science and scientific research
2622286 terrorism ethnicity and integration are all hugely important issues facing the uk today this conference gives us a fantastic opportunity to get right to the bottom of these problems to understand exactly whats happening and think about how we can respond to these new challenges in the future
2622287 the theme of the day is breaking the barriers and we hope to encourage people to believe they can achieve anything they set their minds to regardless of cultural or personal barriers
2622288 universities have a central part to play in maximising opportunities created by new developments in science and technology
2622289 i am delighted to be opening a facility which will bring talented entrepreneurs from around the world who are attracted by the quality of the bioincubator s facilities and the strong links it has with sheffield s universities to exploit cutting edge research and set up high tech companies it will be a great asset to the region and the uk as a whole
2622290 lord sainsbury is responsible for promoting world class science and innovation in the uk something the incubator echoes perfectly not only is it a real honour to have such a key figure in the world of technology and innovation to open the new facility it is also an excellent opportunity to raise the profile of the bioscience sector within the region
2622291 we consider our research a success not only when companies like messier dowty win multi million pound projects for boeings 787 dreamliner but also when we can help one person in the region keep or create a job we hope to demonstrate to lord sainsbury how the growing relationship between the university of sheffield and boeing has helped accomplish both these goals
2622292 we recognise that student noise is a concern to many local residents both to students themselves and other members of the community this campaign which is led by our students is a clear demonstration of their further commitment to the local community where they live work and study i applaud the hard work that the students have dedicated to the project and wish it every success
2622293 we all have to live together and whether you are a student or local resident we all have to respect our neighbours particularly late at night the sshh campaign is the first of many steps aimed at addressing this particular issue we hope that the initiative is given the support that it deserves becoming a future model of good practice when new students are welcomed to the university and the local community
2622294 the initiative introduced by the university and the union is fully supported by the sheffield safer communities partnership this is an extremely positive step in reducing the few complaints of noise nuisance in the area and can only go on to improve community relations with the university
2622295 it is important that the students are leading on such an excellent initiative this is a great way of tackling the small incidents of over noisy students i wish it every success in continuing to improve relationships between students and the wider community
2622296 this month farmers receive their first full payment under the new single farm payment scheme which represents one of the biggest changes to agricultural policy in britain for decades our goal in the research is to understand how local hill farmers can respond to and cope with these changes and what this will mean for upland landscapes and biodiversity
2622297 not only is the peak district an invaluable recreational resource for millions of people in the region it also sustains countless small rural communities whose livelihoods depend on the continued health of the uk s first national park it is vital that we fully understand the impact of these new policies and regulations in order to ensure the survival of the rural community these research projects aim to answer many of our questions and will help support rural life in the region
2622298 this conference will give experts from across the uk and europe the chance to come together and show how a linguistic research technique can help doctors when they meet patients with seizures
2622299 diagnosing epilepsy as opposed to non epileptic seizures is always difficult as there is no single clinical feature that would allow a definite diagnosis one way or the other
2622300 using patients unique expertise of how they experience seizures may also help with treatment if patients feel that their doctor has taken them seriously when they described their problem they are more likely to accept the doctors assessment and recommendations
2622301 we are delighted that our team of archaeologists is working on this project on the isle of north uist this is a fascinating place for anyone interested in archaeology with areas of significant interest such as barpa langais
2622302 the dig is in the early stages but initial findings of flint and quartz tools suggest that the remains of a prehistoric encampment may exist buried beneath the peat
2622303 im delighted that the university of sheffield is holding this special concert on st valentines day firth hall is a beautiful venue and the programme robin has chosen reflects the romantic theme of the day its sure to provide the perfect date for music fans in sheffield this february 14th
2622304 these schemes provide a vital entry point to higher education for children that might otherwise be missing out we are eager to attract as broad a mix of students as possible and outreach programmes are an excellent way of getting students to consider what higher education has to offer for many of these pupils this will be their first ever visit to a university and we hope that the day will help break down some of the perceived barriers and inspire them to fulfil their potential
2622305 although most of the affordable housing planned through s106 agreements is being delivered our research found that delays intrinsic to building on large residential and brownfield sites mean many affordable houses which have been planned have not yet been built in fact on the sites we surveyed 27 of the affordable homes for which planning permission had been granted before 2000 still hadnt been built by the end of 2005
2622306 the section 106 approach to providing affordable housing is an increasingly important strand of government housing policy
2622307 climate change is something that will inevitably affect us all not only in the arctic but also right here in south yorkshire as the arctic heats up it will begin to contribute to further global warming and sea levels will rise even further we will be faced with an unprecedented challenge and it is vital that everyone is aware of how the world is changing around us my talk is accessible and interactive it will allow the public to connect with the problem and encourage people to thing about climate change
2622308 people have been led to believe a lot of nonsense about nanorobotics theres just no possibility that we would ever be able to create a tiny machine like the ship in the 80s film inner space which could drive around peoples bodies carrying out repairs things just dont work like that on the nanoscale you couldnt just build a miniature version of a bigger robot and expect it to be able to move
2622309 not only would nanorobots need to be built in an unconventional way but obviously scientists will have to work to find ways of controlling these new types of microscopic artificial intelligences if the robots of the future to be useful
2622310 if were ever going to succeed in getting work out of robots this small they will need a chemical intelligence like bacteria such chemical computers would not be able to use normal robot sensors like cameras or sonar as they would be much too small relative to the wavelength of light or sound they would need to use protein sensing like bacteria and viruses tiny molecular processors that produce chemicals in the right quantities to drive the units towards desirable sites and away from obnoxious ones
2622311 im delighted to be in sheffield to open this new stem cell facility the university of sheffields centre for stem cell biology is at the forefront of developing stem cell technologies for use in medical applications and this new facility will enable them to pioneer treatments for serious conditions
2622312 stem cell research is paving the way for a healthcare revolution and our new laboratory facility here in sheffield will allow the centre for stem cell biology to be among the first in the world to develop stem cells for eventual use in medical treatments
2622313 the kroto research campus has been established to create and nurture an environment in which multidisciplinary research can flourish it is an imaginative and ambitious venture by the university of sheffield and it is a great personal honour to me that the programme carries my family name
2622314 this project is believed to be the uk s largest multidisciplinary research campuses and it allows us to bring multiple perspectives to our research in these expanding areas of science engineering and medicine we will be able to transfer concepts and skills between the various disciplines and through projects like this the university can further its strong record of partnerships with leading industrial organisations such as boeing and rolls royce
2622315 the kroto research campus is an important development for both the university and for the entire region this innovative approach to research and development and the close cooperation between the main partners will create a highly attractive package for industry and will draw ever growing levels of investment from the world s leading firms to south yorkshire
2622316 im extremely pleased to see this initiative come to fruition weve devised the partnerships terms of reference very carefully working in close liaison with partner companies as a result our students will benefit from the partners input into their education and from new career opportunities and the partners will benefit from their access to the talents and skills of our students
2622317 weve had a phenomenal response from students wanting to get involved in the project and they have helped well over a hundred people already this response shows just how keen students are to get involved in local activities to give something back to the community they live in
2622318 we currently run two ma courses and are developing a third and all of them involve the practical application of languages to the world of work
2622319 were confident that with the benefit of mr marzins knowledge and experience we can develop work placement programmes for our postgraduate students that will both boost the students own career prospects and enable them to bring even more immediate benefits in terms of business and workplace skills to their work placement employers
2622320 this is a particularly significant find because it ends over 30 years of debate within the scientific world
2622321 my findings prove that professor grays discovery could indeed have been spores from land plants that existed 475 million years ago
2622322 these plants represent an early building block of life on earth and they developed to become larger and more complex paving the way for animals to live on land
2622323 once again we intend to recruit academics who excel in research and research led teaching to build on the universitys success
2622324 the new appointments that well be making in the coming weeks will further our aim of retaining and enhancing our international reputation reinforcing both our high teaching quality across the whole spectrum of subject areas and our world class research excellence
2622325 our 100 million plus capital building programme is already creating new state of the art research and learning environments for our students and staff alongside that this investment in appointing new staff who can contribute valuable experience new specialist expertise new perspectives and new impetus should ensure that we continue to set the pace in many aspects of research and teaching for years to come
2622326 this is one of our best concert series yet and we are looking forward to some wonderful performances
2622327 the common belief is that before louis pasteur people believed that disease was caused by foul smelling air or miasma however it seems that even before the birth of christ some physicians had concluded that disease could be caused by small animals which enter the nostrils and cause distempers
2622328 by the mid 1500s there are references showing that some doctors believed that particles rather than gases spread disease and by the 1700s the theory that microscopic animals microbes caused disease was so well known that it was the subject of a number of plays
2622329 in 1842 john goodsir a scottish surgeon showed that stomach upsets with vomiting were caused by bacteria
2622330 pasteur was a great scientist but the assumption that he was the first person to recognise that germs cause disease is a fallacy and does early physicians injustice i am pleased to be able to correct this mistake and hope to restore to john goodsir his rightful place in medical history
2622331 the graduate fair is a really popular annual event and we have had to turn companies away due to a lack of space it will give students nearing the end of their courses an opportunity to meet and question some of the leading graduate employers for students at an earlier stage the offer of work experience on the second day is too good to miss early experience of working life improves career prospects no end
2622332 it is inconceivable that morrell would have used anything other than the purest penicillin on the fuhrer
2622333 it is ironic to think that a drug that has save so many could have helped save hitler had hitler died in july 1944 who knows how many other lives would have been saved
2622334 its both an honour and a pleasure to be able to celebrate our west indies graduates outstanding achievements on their own soil and i wish them all success and happiness in their future careers
2622335 we grew heart cells in the laboratory and then starved them of oxygen for 24 hours those cells subsequently grown in the presence of corm 3 recovered more quickly and were less damaged than those not treated by the drug we repeated the tests using whole hearts and found that hearts treated with corm 3 showed significantly less muscle damage and improved myocardial performance
2622336 corm 3 shows real promise as a new drug to help heart disease organ transplantation and as an anti inflammatory drug the potential therapeutic applications of co rms are huge considering the wide range of physiological activities of carbon monoxide seen in experimental models
2622337 in the past carbon monoxide has been notoriously difficult to use therapeutically in gas form it is difficult to target a specific area of the body to treat because carbon monoxide is toxic and damages cells when inhaled for long periods of time co rms will allow researchers to fully explore the biological function of carbon monoxide and its possibilities as a therapeutic agent
2622338 this research could open up a whole new world of possibilities for treating medical problems including heart disease stroke and brain disorders corm 3 is a marvellous drug but potentially it could be just the beginning
2622339 a very impressive piece of work and an approach from an archaeological unit much to be welcomed
2622340 the judges were impressed with the way that we linked development of the sheffield cutlery and tableware industry to that in parts of other countries such as new england where i am an honorary research fellow at boston university we are very pleased that our work has been recognised in this way and hope this book will prove useful and informative to both specialist and non specialist readers including sheffield people interested in finding out how industry has shaped the city of today
2622341 we used pictures stories and media reports to generate discussions about issues such as pain relief and technologies used to prolong life for example artificial feeding and resuscitation
2622342 people cited trust good communication and the ability to weight up the risks and benefits with medical experts as essential to good quality end of life care many patients also wanted a family veto so that family members could give consent on the patients behalf when they were close to death
2622343 patients ideally wanted to die at home with the help of pain relief and sedation however being cared for at home raised other concerns such as being a burden and fears of dying alone
2622344 we also focused on how people felt about living wills and found that there was concern about a perceived link with euthanasia respondents didnt necessarily think that they would want to stick to an advance plan when the time came
2622345 we concluded that advance care planning is best conducted through a process of discussion and review with patients rather than by using a written statement
2622346 developing a programme of public education was identified as an issue which needs to be addressed urgently if older people and their families are to be better equipped to make informed choices
2622347 most people think that because their child falls asleep in the car that the vibrations must be comfortable
2622348 one of the reasons that this occurs is that child safety seats are cheap in relation to the vehicle seats
2622349 the study doesnt suggest that the vibrations are a health risk to small children but then i am not a medical doctor the differences in exposure are probably not large for short journeys but we need to question whether the levels are acceptable for longer journeys such as when a family is travelling on holiday i hope that the research leads the way for further studies of the effects of vibration on children
2622350 silicon is the second most common element on earth so it seemed likely that bacteria would have evolved to find a way of utilising it
2622351 in our experiments we took two samples of soil that naturally contain bacteria and added them to solutions devoid of any bacterial foodstuffs
2622352 these findings suggest that silicon was a major catalyst in the growth of the first bacterium and therefore for the beginnings of life on earth
2622353 this award is a reflection of the universitys on going commitment to sound educational practice and development in the caribbean
2622354 this was long before anyone had heard about genetically modified organisms and this first red canary in its time was as ground breaking as dolly the sheep
2622355 sportspulse which is supported by objective one is delivering the vision that many people have had around sports science for a number of years this is one of the most exciting developments with huge potential that we have seen since the invention of stainless steel in the region
2622356 sportspulse will help to shape the future of british sport and will place south yorkshire firmly on the map as a world leader in sports science and technology the project will bring new businesses and jobs into the area and will almost certainly help some of the uks athletes in the 2004 olympics in athens
2622357 extensive research in europe and the usa has shown that green roofs have many environmental social and environmental benefits and theres a wealth of experience available in their construction and maintenance so theres no longer any excuse for dismissing them as eccentric or impractical we believe that architects and property developers should now be acknowledging the benefits and adopting green roofs much more widely letting the grass grow over their heads rather than under their feet
2622358 the enthusiasm this event has already generated demonstrates that green roofs are on the verge of becoming part of mainstream construction practice and were keen to encourage that trend during the conference well be discussing technical aspects of green roof installation and management the creative design potential of green roofs and the economic and environmental arguments for using them much more widely
2622359 the city council are very excited about this project and are very grateful for vanessas work in putting the bid together for the lottery funding we are also happy to provide all the assistance she may need and hope that the people of hull will come forward with their memories of the fair over the years
2622360 hull fair has always been a highlight of the national fairground calendar its one of europes largest travelling funfairs and has a history stretching back to 1293ad now we aim to capture some of its more recent history for posterity so everyone with memories of the fair whether from the recent or the distant past will be welcome to share them when we start our reminiscence workshops in hull this december
2622361 hull fair is an integral part of the citys heritage and this grant will really make its more recent history come to life were particularly pleased to have awarded this grant as currently the people of hull are missing out on their fair share of lottery money due to low levels of applications theres a common misconception that hlf only funds big museums historic buildings or parks but heritage can also include peoples traditions culture memories we want everyone to enjoy their heritage and look forward to welcoming more applications for funding from hull
2622362 this important piece of work will give us the first independent research into the way that cats hunting affects local urban ecosystems currently interest groups quote different figures depending on their standpoint this work will enable us to predict whether wildlife figures will change over the years as a result of hunting by cats or whether the numbers they kill are largely insignificant to overall population levels
2622363 let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works
2622364 the study involved reviewing all of the high quality data that has been collected about toothbrushes in the past by bringing together all of the relevant research in this way we can provide unbiased and reliable evidence
2622365 people who use electric toothbrushes neednt worry unduly all types of electric toothbrushes were shown to be as effective as manual brushing although those with oscillating heads were shown to be most effective if you like the feel of an electric toothbrush there is no reason to stop using it
2622366 our experts will be able to offer advice on all of the options for training and there will be many job opportunities for people who are already qualified
2622367 la p rpura de la rosa is not only a historical landmark but also a brilliant example of spanish culture it unites music poetry dance wit and drama with a love of visual colour tone colour and colourful metaphor and with the baroque art of improvised performance
2622368 this grant is great news for community football in our region
2622369 for the first time we now have the capacity to open up full scale use of the universitys facilities to the wider community and we also have a number of other new community activities in the pipeline
2622370 were thrilled that this grant has been awarded to the university we look to improve the quality of pitches and facilities within the region and encourage people throughout the community to play football not only do they now have access to one of the best facilities in the country we also have more opportunities to run football coach and education courses ensuring that a quality experience for participants can be guaranteed
2622371 this event is always a lot of fun but its also a chance for students to network on a national scale and compare ideas the event started off as a football match organised by frank morton a lecturer at manchester university between the universities of manchester and birmingham and from there it has grown and grown in fact you might describe it as a chain reaction
2622372 its a great way of raising money for a good cause and helping people to keep fit at the same time were expecting to raise more than our 2000 target and one man has already been promised more than 900
2622373 bouldering is a good workout for both the body and the mind our instructors are always on hand to offer help and advice and unlike outdoor climbing you dont have to wait for good weather to take part
2622374 this is a fantastic way to promote the fun side of science to the wider community the programme of events has been planned by sheffield hallam university and the university of sheffield in association with local schools museums industry and commerce to make sure that theres something for everyone
2622375 i knew that the university owned one of darwins letters and id decided to make a poster explaining our links with darwin so i took the letter from our safe where its kept i then discussed the poster with a colleague who to my surprise said he had the letter in his filing cabinet when i disputed this we looked at each other simultaneously realising that for almost a hundred years the university had assumed that it had one darwin letter when in fact it had two
2622376 im delighted to have been chosen for this award against very stiff competition it will be a wonderful opportunity to write an overview of the two million year long occupation of this enormously large and diverse continent and to make a wider public aware of the discoveries made there over the last 20 years
2622377 student volunteering at this university just gets bigger and better every year one of our biggest events yet the just do it weekend covers all aspects of community volunteering from helping out in local schools to working in woodlands and parks
2622378 i am really proud of all our student volunteers they are extremely dedicated and make an active contribution to the sheffield community that they live and study in
2622379 kars have been implicated in disease states such as epilepsy and neurodegeneration this research is another step forward in the scientific understanding of the human brain and as a result it could also lead to possible solutions to neurological diseases
2622380 to be involved with this programme is a fantastic opportunity for both nick and i politicians and researchers are often dealing with the same issues albeit from different perspectives and it is vital that we develop good working relationships and build up more effective communication
2622381 systematic phonics looks promising it has got results and we have found a positive effect that is statistically significant we believe that balanced with other methods it should become a routine part of literacy teaching it should be part of every literacy teachers repertoire
2622382 but we have to urge caution as the evidence base is relatively limited we have just a dozen small trials the biggest of which involved 120 children there is no definitive conclusion from the trials included in the review as to which phonics approaches are most effective
2622383 we are recommending a large scale uk based randomised controlled trial to investigate the relative effectiveness of different systematic phonics approaches for children with different learning characteristics
2622384 archaeologists have searched for the earliest prehistoric settlement of the western isles for several decades but have been frustrated by the deep covering of peat that covers large parts of the islands this potentially exciting discovery has only been made possible with support and funding from the technical services department of comhairle nan eilean siar we now eagerly await the exact dating of the site
2622385 this find could be of huge archaeological and historical significance for scotland
2622386 we want to raise awareness among female professional voice users of the effects of sexual hormones on their working capacities and how to prevent possible long term voice damage we are interested in contacting women who use their voices professionally and who have noticed vocal changes related to their menstrual cycle
2622387 our voice production mechanism is essentially invisible and it is only fairly recently that we have had the ability to analyse what is actually happening in some detail tracking the detail of how vocal folds vibrate is the basic approach adopted in this work and it has served to confirm the conclusions in relation to this contraceptive pill
2622388 my hope is that plan ahead will help many women avoid the anguish caused by the early or unexpected arrival of declining fertility and menopause inhibin b and amh hormone levels start to fall relatively early in reproductive life with a later fall in fsh by combining the test on all three hormones we are able to offer women the most accurate ovarian reserve hormone test available in the world today which will help them plan for the future by giving a predictive assessment of the number of eggs in their ovaries
2622389 there is no doubt that couples are leaving having a family until later in life and the negative effect of that decision and the ability to conceive is well documented
2622390 as keen enthusiasts of messiaen s work we were delighted to be given the opportunity to explore in great depth the composer s life something that no one had ever done before
2622391 this book would not have been made possible without the unprecedented access to messiaen s private archive granted to us by the composer s widow yvonne loriod messiaen to whom we are tremendously grateful
2622392 plants use a range of processes to adapt to harsh and potentially damaging environmental conditions
2622393 to fully apply this research to improving the productivity of crops we need to understand how these processes relate to plant growth and development in field conditions processes that may appear important in the laboratory may not be in the varied conditions of the field
2622394 this demonstrates how research into fundamental biological processes has the potential to have a big impact on people s lives around the world many research projects supported by bbsrc provide fundamental information that can underpin improvements in staple crops both in the uk as we face the effects of climate change and overseas where it can aid sustainable agriculture and improve food security
2622395 dr rossiter has a strong commitment to teaching development and is a leading light in the development of a number of initiatives within the department no one can doubt his energy and commitment to the area and i am delighted that he has received this award
2622396 i am somewhat humbled to receive such an award knowing how many excellent teaching staff there are i hope i can use this opportunity to raise the profile of teaching within universities and equally importantly to raise interest in engineering careers among school pupils
2622397 the lives and behaviour of social insects have many amazing parallels with those of humans they build prisons choose the sex of their offspring put out their rubbish punish miscreants and even sacrifice their lives to defend their colonies
2622398 they also communicate with each other by dancing and by releasing chemicals the more we find out about their behaviour the more fascinated we are by its subtlety and sophistication
2622399 hefces decision recognises the universitys outstanding achievement in terms of across the board performance the extra places are part of a carefully planned strategy which will enable us to offer additional places in subject areas where demand is high and growing and to continue to broaden the range of higher education opportunities for people in our region whilst maintaining the high academic standards on which the universitys success is founded
2622400 sheffield west pct university of sheffield sheffield hallam university and the health protection agency in sheffield are working closely to organise the public health response to this outbreak
2622401 mmr was introduced in 1988 anyone now over the age of 15 will not have been offered mmr and will therefore have no immunity to mumps unless they have already had the disease we are not currently advising adults other than university students to have mmr because there is no evidence of spread outside the universities there have been no cases reported among members of staff many of whom will already have had mumps we are therefore not offering the vaccine to staff members as a routine we are keeping the situation under review and will issue further advice if necessary
2622402 increased industrial productivity and improved comfort for hip replacement patients are just two of the many benefits that could result from overcoming zirconias achilles heel
2622403 alex is obviously an extremely bright young man but he has also shown great maturity and a dedicated approach to his work he has a great future ahead of him and i fully expect him to take the world by storm
2622404 this whole experience has been magical and has really increased my confidence the placement allowed me to really focus on my work and i got an enormous amount of support from professor gibbs the event in london was extremely enjoyable and i was very relaxed when the results were announced i was delighted when i found i had won and was smiling so much that i could barely say thank you
2622405 over the years the sheffield management lecture has proved to be a stimulating and informative event regularly attracting over 300 guests from regional organisations
2622406 this years lecture offers the opportunity to hear how nationwides passion for customer service excellence has differentiated them in an extremely competitive market and how they continue to apply the learning they gained through the unisys management today awards for the benefit of both the organisation and their members
2622407 issues such as how they measure the commercial value of service and whether they can see a link in to the bottom line as well as the importance of employee retention will also form part of the discussion
2622408 we already knew that low levels of dopamine are seen in diseases such as parkinsons and that abnormalities in dopamine function are often present in patients with schizophrenia or tourettes syndrome
2622409 in medical laboratories rats are often used to investigate theories about basal ganglia function as this part of the rat brain is quite similar to the human brain
2622410 when we decreased the amount of dopamine in the system the robot had problems initiating movement and sometimes stopped completely
2622411 these experiments help us to understand some of the specific changes in the basal ganglia underlying these important brain disorders and should lead to a better understanding of them in the future robots with simulated brain circuits might also help us to identify and simulate new forms of treatment for damaged brains brain bots are fairly new technology but they have great potential for the future of bio research
2622412 this is a great honour and i am particularly pleased because it has been awarded by my peers i was brought up and educated in scotland and it is wonderful to continue to contribute to the countrys higher education system
2622413 a sheffield man who long ago understood the importance of things
2622414 universities face a number of important financial challenges arising from the recent white paper i look forward to ensuring that the university of sheffield is well placed to meet them and that it moves forward in sound financial health
2622415 when it rains britains roads generate a considerable volume of run off
2622416 the sheffield research project will look at the fate of these pollutants how they are deposited and transported within receiving waters and how they might accumulate in the food chain the team of biologists and engineers will investigate the ecological significance of these contaminated sediments and devise a procedure to assess and predict the impacts of highway runoff on receiving watercourses
2622417 i am really pleased with how well the rowathon went we were aiming to raise 2000 so to almost double our target is unbelievable 47 members took part and rowed a total of 154 453m between them raising an average 76 each
2622418 here at s10 we want people to enjoy their exercise routines so they can achieve their goals by running charity and other events it gets people involved in their club and is a chance to meet other members creating a warm and friendly environment we chose to support weston park because it is so close that it touches the lives of many of our members and lots of the hospital staff train here
2622419 the centre will allow us to get more involved with this important region to the mutual benefit of the region city liberal studies and ourselves as we all deepen our understanding of the profound economic and social changes underway
2622420 as one of the uks leading research universities our partnerships involve links with prestigious and significant research institutions we have been validating degrees at city liberal studies one such institution for some time and now we look forward to this research centre enriching our already fruitful and exciting partnership most importantly seerc will ensure that research findings and knowledge gained about the area are to the benefit of south east europe where they can be put to the best practical use
2622421 our hope is that seerc will succeed in providing a multi disciplinary perspective on key issues of interest to the south east european region including economic development information technology infrastructure political integration health and social policy seerc will also place an emphasis on producing research results that can be applied by industry non governmental organisations and policy makers in the region
2622422 the photo multipliers detect the light given off on the rare occasions when neutrinos interact with material such as rock in the seabed or even seawater and become muons
2622423 neutrinos have no charge so they always travel in a straight line by following the path of the muons we will be able to determine where the neutrinos came from and discover the source of their creation
2622424 the reason that we need to build the telescope under the sea is that the water prevents muons from cosmic rays in the atmosphere from contaminating our study by looking down the earth also acts as a filter as muons that havent been created from a neutrino will be absorbed before they can get into the study area
2622425 it is important that controversial areas of science are subjected to rigorous scrutiny its difficult for science to categorically prove that something doesnt happen but our work coupled with the fact that biological cold fusion appears to be theoretically impossible suggests that the phenomenon is non existent
2622426 i had a fantastic time last year and i know our children are really looking forward to it this year
2622427 i would like to give other kids the opportunities i had
2622428 id like to get more experience of working with children it also sounds like fun
2622429 these sessions give fitness instructors a chance to pick up new ideas as well as allowing them to network within the industry we re really pleased to be hosting an event that will improve fitness classes across the country
2622430 this conference is significant because it underscores the vital contribution feminism has made already towards understanding the role of gender in creating educational advantage or disadvantage and it moves the debate forward to a new phase of international academic co operation for gender justice
2622431 it was an unexpected honour to receive this prestigious award which is usually made on the basis of an outstanding piece of original research this is the first time a book has won it while the task of editing such a book which contains the input of more than 50 internationally recognised researchers was a bit like trying to herd cats i hope the end result has made a significant contribution to advancing the cause of evidence based medical education
2622432 its been a fantastic year since october weve dealt with over 920 student enquiries thats almost 5 of the full time student population all this has been made possible due to the energy and commitment of our student volunteers the enthusiastic support of our partner organisations and the launch of the governments higher education active community fund heacf initiative without which none of this would have become reality
2622433 i wanted to contribute to the community that i am part of now i am studying in sheffield it was very satisfying to see a task right through it motivated me to do more volunteering
2622434 our aim is to raise the achievement of our year 10 students by giving them the opportunity to learn about microbiology in a high tech environment we hope the visit will stimulate the students to think about the opportunities that higher education offers i believe it further backs up our strong commitment to science teaching at chaucer which has recently been boosted by the completion of a suite of new science labs funded by the lea
2622435 i am delighted to support this initiative and to use our facilities to encourage students to learn about these fascinating areas of biological research
2622436 all schools in sheffield are developing partnerships with the wider community in order to develop our curriculum provide greater flexibility for our students and to demonstrate how what they learn at school is relevant to the wider world we are particularly pleased that chaucer has been able to develop this link for the benefit of the students involved in our vocational science course
2622437 this is an exciting project that will give the pupils chance to work alongside professional scientists i hope more this experience will inspire more schoolchildren to pursue a career in science and engineering
2622438 we are pleased to support a project that is bringing the cutting edge research at the university to their local schools
2622439 the university of sheffield is delighted that its partnership with the boeing company and other top flight manufacturers will form the hub of the advanced manufacturing park in south yorkshire todays news is a real coup for the region it is an initiative of international significance which demonstrates the benefits that are gained when cutting edge research and industry come together to make a reality of the knowledge economy it confirms our position as a centre of international excellence in manufacturing
2622440 boeing and the university of sheffields presence on the advanced manufacturing park will ensure it is a world leading centre of the most advanced technologies for the aerospace automotive and medical implant industries
2622441 this decision by boeing is a major step forward to engage selective technological expertise in key world locations to ensure the best of tomorrows technology is captured by boeing and made available in its future products to exceed customer demand
2622442 carpenter would have loved this resource he was always trying to show people the value of his collection and now they can explore it at the touch of a button we hope that making the collection so freely available will lead to study of the material and encourage performers to bring it to life again
2622443 students participating in this project are gaining excellent training for their future careers and are providing a much needed resource for the local community this project benefits everyone involved and we look forward to its successful future
2622444 because they tell us so much about the lives of ordinary people the poor the desperate outlaws and life on the margins of london society the old bailey court records are a treasure trove of social legal and family history
2622445 now that were making them freely available everyone from schoolchildren to legal historians amateur local or family historians to sociologists can have easy access
2622446 because the records are searchable in so many different ways anyone whos interested in the history of a particular street or parish the rise and fall of a particular type of crime the evolution of policing or in londons black gay jewish irish or traveller communities now has an amazingly rich source of information at their fingertips the proceedings are also a great source for family history research
2622447 i am delighted to receive this award which reflects the high quality of the teaching of medical students by and of their teachers the prize will fund a very exciting project we will be working with patients to train them to both educate and assess medical students which will give our students a unique insight into the way their clinical practice affects the patient experience
2622448 hopefully once we get better known in the area and more people come to concerts we will be able to make more and more for charity the 21st may concert will be raising money for local cancer research charities but the plan is to collect for a number of different causes over the years that the series will be running
2622449 this scheme demonstrates the value that our students make to the communities in which they live sheffield has a long tradition of welcoming students to the city and it is this warm welcome which encourages them to get involved in community activities

2622535 the electoral finance act imposes a form of election year censorship never seen before in new zealand
2622536 the act affects all kiwis as it undermines four cherished democratic rights the right to hold free and fair elections the right to exercise free speech the right to campaign either for or against the government and the right to be fully informed
2622537 the act imposes complex and uncertain restrictions on what each of us can say and do in election year the human rights commission argued last year that these restrictions should apply for no more than 3 months prior to the election yet parliament ignored the commission and imposed restrictions for the full year we cant undo the censorship we have had to put up with since 1 january 2008 but it is not too late to repeal the law and for the parties to fight this election under the old electoral law
2622538 both the human rights commission and the electoral commission said last year that third parties who wanted to influence the election result by placing election advertisements should be allowed to spend up to 300 000 parliament ignored them on this issue also and if the act is not to be repealed in its entirety before the election it is not too late for parliament to amend it and to allow third parties to spend up to 300 000 as recommended by both these bodies

2622544 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2622545 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2622546 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2622547 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2622548 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2622549 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2622550 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2622551 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised

2622572 i am glad she ms salaitoga is now safe and that she has been released but i am disappointed despite our cooperation with authorities last night about eight police officers turned up at her home this morning and took her from her family
2622573 no consideration that her children were watching and that she is pregnant she had told them she would rather have a legal representative present before answering any questions and the fact that they chose to threaten her if she did not answer their questions is a matter of concern
2622574 we do not wish anyone in the community to be subjected to such a treatment this despite we were willing to cooperate with the police
2622575 we basically are looking after serafina and her family caring for her and letting her spend time with her family

2622592 hell play more next week so hell throw more in general part of that is game plan part of that is how the flow of the game is going
2622593 it wasnt by design for him to have so few attempts but we knew he was not going to play very much
2622594 i thought we were getting in a groove i wanted to go but thats coachs decision
2622595 i dont know yet that we can all of a sudden be a pass heavy team and throw the ball all over the place
2622596 with a right tackle that was injured the last half of the year coming back a new left tackle and not very much line depth theres no part of me right now that could tell you we would be able to change right now from where we were last year

2622615 we obviously know that last year red zone offense was our achilles heel a little bit
2622616 the one positive thing out of that whole deal is sustaining drives keeping the chains moving eating up some clock picking up some yards and when we get down there being able to capitalize and cap it off with a touchdown
2622617 last year a thing we struggled with was not forcing them to go three and out on the opening series

2622620 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things

2622720 the grasshoppers do seem to be pretty bad this year

2622739 our government is providing responsible leadership in challenging times by focusing on the priorities of canadians cutting taxes and investing in people knowledge and communities

2622756 aafia has been put in a new york jail was produced before a judge in new york and would be heard before a judge in new york while the public sentiment in new york was so anti aafia that the dailies have started calling aafia a suicide bomber
2622757 from me and my family we do not blame any muslim for what has been happening to our sister for the last five years our allah will take revenge for us
2622758 the government had been in contact with us during the last five years and has been saying that dr aafia would be back in a few days
2622759 now we have been told that all the three children were fine but looking at aafias condition we fear that the children might be in danger
2622760 it is immaterial who handed over aafia to the fbi but i am proud of being a pakistani after looking at the support from the civil society and the media and my heart wishes that i should go out and shout at the top of my voice that i am a proud pakistani a nation which has stood by its daughter
2622761 what i want is to bring aafia back to pakistan and i beg the media and the government to do something for aafia and bring her back
2622762 the americans would send her to jail for 40 years then what would we do aafia was not a green card holder then why she was being tried in new york

2622766 the increasing evidence that the us is using the shamsi base against iran
2622767 the isi was also seeking to make more public the indian ingresses into balochistan and fata and the continuing acceptance by the us and karzai of terrorist groups operating in balochistan from kabul
2622768 us first turned against the taliban only when they rejected the unocal oil deal in 1998 so if the isi is guilty of having links with taliban remnants so is the cia only the isi wont play ball with the cia anymore and that is not acceptable to the us

2622786 in its first four days its had 1 8 million hits that shows that the community is very interested in the information it can provide
2622787 the liberal party wanders around saying its all a waste of time presumably they would abolish it presumably they believe in less information for consumers
2622788 but consumers recognise that in a competitive market the more information they can have the better and we agree and were determined to give them that information
2622789 we said before the election the biggest impact on grocery prices was international factors we said before the election the biggest henpeck on petrol prices was world oil prices and that continues to be the case
2622790 the now prime minister and now treasurer were asked can you guarantee to bring prices down they said before the election no but we will do whatever we can to put more competitive pressure in to the market
2622791 its not a tip sheet its a review of the referees performance which every coach every week gets
2622792 its a review to say yeah this referee got this decision right that referee got that decision wrong
2622793 its more or less a check for them coaches as well to fix up areas in their game that we believe in the debrief came up
2622794 so to call it a tip sheet when it suits you is probably a little bit disappointing
2622795 you can call it what you like but thats not what it is
2622796 the bottom line of it all is the referee on occasion does have issues but so does the discipline of football teams in general
2622797 itd cost me a lot of money if we had have got beaten because i wouldve unloaded
2622798 it refereeing is a tough job but theyre making it tougher for themselves by having these stupid tip sheets
2622799 they pick a couple of little things in the game previously which they so call review and they knit pick their way through a game
2622800 i think it is a little dramatic to say there wont be any non bank lenders
2622801 they certainly have had some financing issues in recent months but i dont think there is any evidence non bank lenders are going to disappear completely and they will continue to provide some competition
2622802 any future cuts are a matter for the rba we certainly would expect a reduction to be passed on

2622808 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2622809 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2622810 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2622811 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2622812 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised

2622826 as an athlete you really dont get to see much of it
2622827 they have you in a holding arena where you just sit there with 300 other countries and hang out obviously the best part is walking into the stadium thats the biggest rush
2622828 i think we left the hotel at 5 30 and didnt get back until 1 30 in the morning it kind of throws your schedule off
2622829 the press we ran at tennessee the 1 2 1 1 we run that here too
2622830 candace is used to being on the top of that and catch is used to being in the interceptor role our man to man full court pressure is also very similar
2622831 in the first quarter when there was that lull candace was huge in shadowing the ball getting steals and helping us pick up the tempo catch was the same way
2622832 sometimes in games you have to ease your way it but 13 2 is not easing your way in
2622833 its a good feeling we know we can call time out and regain our poise
2622834 i think our greatest strength right now is were 12 deep and can bring in players to bring you more energy kara and catch especially did that the minute they stepped on the floor
2622835 were picking up on defense so much more than we have in the past
2622836 and players know its 3 4 5 hard minutes and then youre out if youre not doing that you dont get back in the rotation
2622837 as an athlete you really dont get to see much of it
2622838 they have you in a holding arena where you just sit there with 300 other countries and hang out obviously the best part is walking into the stadium thats the biggest rush

2622847 and players know its 3 4 5 hard minutes and then youre out if youre not doing that you dont get back in the rotation
2622848 this is a deep team youve got to stay in that rotation or youll get buried in 10 days together i couldnt ask for one thing more from this group than how hard theyve worked at that end of the floor forcing 27 turnovers is exactly what weve been trying to accomplish
2622849 we lacked only a car this was adjusted by a gentleman who saying he acted only from pure friendship sold us one of

2622852 i got nailed for speeding on pit road leaving the pit box
2622853 i guess i just didnt know where pit road speed ended i had the engine off just trying to save fuel and i got a soft sequence and i knew we were in trouble and we were counting on cautions
2622854 the delmon trade really started our transformation because of the areas we were able to address
2622855 the first two years knowing we couldnt compete was just collecting as many players as we could irrespective of fit
2622856 the pendulum shifted this offseason and the emphasis became much more about constructing a 25 man roster we felt we finally had enough talent in the organization that it was time to move past making moves in a vacuum and to start viewing all subsequent moves in the context of what it would mean in terms of run scoring and run prevention
2622857 it seems like there are lot of different kinds of libraries public libraries school libraries university libraries college libraries law libraries medical libraries corporate libraries special libraries private libraries but really theres just one big library with branches all over the world

2622860 users are familiar with betas from google so we can change it any way we want without going back to the committee for approval
2622861 we arent selling to the smaller niche consumers why dont we create a new stripped down product so we can move into that market segment it would take a year or so to create a new design that would be underpowered lack significant functionality that our major accounts consider critical and fail to conform to industry standards oh and because the target market is made up of smaller players wed have to be satisfied with a lower profit margin

2622870 i spent like two days tracking this down and talked to that guy not just the people at hoosier or republic in indianapolis but to the guy who purchases it
2622871 comingled recycling plastic 1 7 steel and aluminum cans and glass
2622872 they tell me that theyre doing the right thing i dont have any reason to disbelieve them
2622873 there comes a time when you just have to trust government a little bit
2622874 we are fairly confident that those four commodities are being recycled
2622875 now as far as the glass issue i havent followed the truck so i dont know
2622876 were concerned about it it comes up every month weve got studies where were working on it its a real problem
2622877 i think we were looking into different uses besides recycling to find out exactly what we could do with glass
2622878 as far as this facility is concerned until were told that we have no outlet or we cant do anything with it were committed to our customers to take the glass and process it and recycle it
2622879 i can tell you every piece of glass thats come through this facility that weve shipped to indianapolis to my knowledge that yes indeed they are trying to recycle that as much as possible
2622880 i read the biography of someone who lived through much of an extraordinary century and saw amazing changes in world around her
2622881 your husband didnt do bad either i expect mr sheldon could have really beat you but wanted to be real gallant and diplomatic and let his wife win p 151
2622882 she says i found that you have a warrant for your arrest out of lawrence county
2622883 so then she said she was going to have to arrest me and handcuff me she said they were going to in the morning send me to lawrence county
2622884 she says youll be in lawrence county possibly for several days before youll get a hearing
2622885 im sitting in the car for probably an hour and a half with my hands behind my back handcuffed
2622886 i have so many i cant carry all those little bottles in my purse so i put them all in one
2622887 im sitting in the car for probably an hour and a half with my hands behind my back handcuffed
2622888 i figured the nurse would give me my pills that night
2622889 i had this little steel bench to lay on for that amount of time no blanket no nothing
2622890 i have to strip naked in front of her and i have to put this chemical on my hair to kill lice
2622891 they threw some shoes at me some plastic little jail shoes
2622892 i had this little steel bench to lay on for that amount of time
2622893 i said theres no way i can get up on that bunk
2622894 they bring you this tray with this pool of oatmeal on it
2622895 i have to strip naked in front of her and i have to put this chemical on my hair to kill lice
2622896 i didnt want to be in there with all these drug addicts
2622897 i went down there and paid it off as soon as i found out about it
2622898 i dont have my money my purse my phone im in the alley
2622899 they said the nurse is busy youll have to call back later
2622900 im 54 years old i didnt want to be in there with all these drug addicts
2622901 it doesnt matter who you are once youre in there youre treated just like everyone else
2622902 and youre treated like youre a criminal whether you are or not
2622903 i dont see any reason they had to have me handcuffed even from the beginning
2622904 but especially when im in the jail with the doors down and three police officers standing there with guns
2622905 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2622906 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2622907 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2622908 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2622909 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2622910 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2622911 you can never get to peace and inner security without first acknowledging all of the good things in your life if youre forever wanting and longing for more without first appreciating things the way they are youll stay in discord

2622913 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2622914 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2622915 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2622916 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2622917 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2622918 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2622919 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2622920 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2622921 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2622922 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2622923 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2622924 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2622925 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2622926 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2622927 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2622928 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2622929 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2622930 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2622931 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2622932 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2622933 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2622934 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2622935 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2622936 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2622937 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2622938 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2622939 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2622940 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2622941 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2622942 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2622943 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2622944 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2622945 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2622946 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2622947 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2622948 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2622949 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2622950 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2622951 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2622952 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2622953 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2622954 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2622955 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2622956 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2622957 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2622958 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2622959 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2622960 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2622961 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2622962 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2622963 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2622964 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2622965 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2622966 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

2622968 jadi ada lima ayat alquran yang digunakan untuk mendeskreditkan islam padahal isinya sangat bertolak belakang justru ajaran islam ini sangat sangat damai dan mengajak umatnya untuk memiliki hubungan harmonis dengan pemeluk agama apapun

2622972 i think it is a little dramatic to say there wont be any non bank lenders
2622973 they certainly have had some financing issues in recent months but i dont think there is any evidence non bank lenders are going to disappear completely and they will continue to provide some competition
2622974 any future cuts are a matter for the rba we certainly would expect a reduction to be passed on
2622975 one of the important things is it is very difficult for people to change financial products
2622976 the dow jones was up over 300 points and that sets up a good day for our market in a broader sense although there are going to be a raft of winners and losers
2622977 the oil price being down 5 a barrel is certainly going to weigh down the energy sector although banks should continue to do well
2622978 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2622979 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2622980 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2622981 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2622982 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2622983 being a city boy i was terrified of small towns
2622984 but theres this kind of a warmth that only small towns possess anyone can go out and take a photo of the new york skyline los angeles boston at night there are all these lights but in small towns you dont have the glamour i followed the moonlight in this series and found pieces of the area i didnt realize existed
2622985 one of my mentors first showed me the emotional impact of a photograph is the most important thing
2622986 if you think of vietnam the average person thinks of one of those iconic vietnam photos if you think of the oklahoma city bombing you think of that photograph of the firefighter and child i try to capture the emotion of a place in my work
2622987 we live in an area where many people find inspiration in the natural beauty around us
2622988 there are two things about this place that are extraordinary we have the natural world and the weather that transforms it into something new every day the other thing is the people we all have a relationship with the landscape around us and these four artists express their communion with the land in beautiful ways
2622989 i started when i was a small girl growing up
2622990 i started with crayolas my cousins would give me broken up crayolas and i would use them and then i did some watercolors and when i was in high school i started with oils i took many classes at highlands ive always liked to paint and draw i paint with a group sometimes we travel out and paint on location but most of the time we take photographs and work from those at home
2622991 i try to keep my camera with me in case something strikes me i take pictures and i use the pictures to paint from it all depends on the lighting a good thing to paint it strikes you the way the sun goes through the leaves the way the colors change and youve got to paint it my home is my favorite spot we have 10 acres on the tecolote river i love walking around the land theres so much here it is just the most beautiful area ive ever seen theres nothing like it
2622992 this is a great opportunity to meet people you may not otherwise meet
2622993 sylvia and marlene live out of town so this is a good chance for members of the community to come out and support some of our local landscape artists these are people who look at the landscape around them their own surroundings and have deep feelings about it and translate those feelings so that all of us can enjoy them

2622998 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2622999 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2623000 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2623001 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2623002 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2623003 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2623004 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2623005 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2623006 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2623007 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2623008 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2623009 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2623010 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2623011 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2623012 boil it in some beef stock add some noodles and rooster sauce and youve got yourself a hot snack
2623013 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2623014 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2623015 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2623016 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2623017 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2623018 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2623019 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2623020 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2623021 im glad my body could do it because now i know i have it in me
2623022 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2623023 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2623024 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2623025 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2623026 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2623027 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2623028 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2623029 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2623030 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2623031 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2623032 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2623033 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2623034 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2623035 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2623036 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

2623041 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2623042 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

2623044 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2623045 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2623046 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2623047 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2623048 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2623049 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2623050 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2623051 this cute bar is right on maiden lane and a perfect little hiding spot
2623052 hellooooo ladies definitely we can seat you come on in
2623053 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2623054 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2623055 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2623056 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2623057 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2623058 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

2623088 problem with historical fiction i do have a problem with the deliberate misinterpretation of history you cant play with a sacred history and turn it into soft core pornography
2623089 i think that the maturity of the team and the experience is something that plays into it
2623090 we all dont sit back and count points and we dont sit back and decide who we are racing we dont get wound up about where we are in the points we kind of know it is what it is as you get to the end of the chase here you just kind of go about your business and do the best thing that you can
2623091 we come to the racetrack wanting to win every week and when you cant win every week you want to do the best you can if you cant do the best that you can and you wreck you want to gain all the spots you can after you wreck its just a checklist that you go down as the circumstances present themselves and i think thats the good thing about having been through a lot of this stuff before is you dont really get stressed out about it you just go and do what you know how to do and hope that everything works itself out
2623092 i grew up on road courses and won races from the time i was five years old on road courses
2623093 weve always run good on the road courses and enjoy coming here and being a part of both the road races
2623094 i think you approach it just as you would any other track obviously the strategy is a little bit different here than it would be at some of the places but you approach it just as you would any other race and you want to do as good as you can to get the best result that you can
2623095 im pleased by the effort by everybody at eddie dhondt motorsports
2623096 im happy for eddie dhondt that he was able to go off on his own deal and be successful
2623097 i find it hard to believe how a dish with five spices be bland
2623098 i normally wouldnt take it off the bill since i didnt see anything myself but since youve been here before and you are so nice about it i removed it
2623099 im sorry it wasnt for your liking may i offer you a substitute or dessert
2623100 this is so much better than buca i hated that food it tasted like jack in the box
2623101 i think you better plan my bday dinner at buca cause i can afford that
2623102 how is it for the love of god that you still cant make it taste a bit better
2623103 hes so aggressive right now i think brian orakpo has been good for sam to tell him get here faster or you gotta be tougher
2623104 this senior class the older guys are doing a lot better job of coaching the younger ones than our previous two years we think its bringing some of those younger ones on quicker
2623105 sam acho eddie jones and henry melton gave us the chance to move lamarr houston inside and not have a dropoff
2623106 its not that much of a difference to me i played left tackle all through high school and when i started out here i played left
2623107 as a swing guy i went to right tackle when cedric dockery went down its just switching from right technique to left technique its not a big deal
2623108 hes pure size hes 320 something pounds but he doesnt look like it you look at him and he can really move
2623109 hes a great christian young man you put him on that field and all he does is block people and get after them it doesnt feel outwardly as nasty but hes got a great tenacity level
2623110 if they dont have that theyre going to have a hard time playing so all of them i would like to think have a good degree of it
2623111 i get a little bit of time with john chiles every day quite a bit hes doing a nice job i think you can definitely see spurts where hes very comfortable there
2623112 working on the little things is always a challenge for any wide receiver john taking a bunch of snaps at quarterback and then coming out in certain packages and playing wideout its just going to be a learning process for him

2623114 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2623115 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2623116 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2623117 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2623118 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2623119 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2623120 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2623121 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

2623132 last year he finished strong and this year he looks like he is on the same page hopefully that second half trend will continue
2623133 it is a theory of whether or not it is contagious i dont believe it because the pitcher can make some great pitches and get out of an inning ive seen it it was good to score some runs and keep applying the pressure
2623134 ive never been one to get out of the gates blazing i build and i like that
2623135 i build through the season and get better and better and i get tougher to deal with on a day to day basis
2623136 a couple of things i read didnt make any sense
2623137 maybe chief silva has to come and grab somebody in his neck and pin them to the wall
2623138 im very close to doing that so write that down
2623139 maybe half of the team wants to do the best they can i can talk about the starting rotation we want to do our best every time we cross that line you know
2623140 but maybe half of the team doesnt have that mentality they only think to finish strong and to put up the numbers thats great but that affects us as a team that doesnt work out
2623141 instead of moving a runner they want to get a base hit just because of the numbers instead of to get a ground ball maybe i want to strike him out because of my numbers you know what i mean thats what were doing right now
2623142 i dont care if we are 40 games behind we should play better than this
2623143 when i hear somebody say something about selfish play i challenge anyone to go in there and look at the tape from every game from march 31 to present time and show me an example of someone being selfish
2623144 i stand corrected if someone can point it out when you are saying someone is selfish i need specifics
2623145 he shouldnt have said it to the writers he should say it to me and the teammate he is directing it at its the wrong way to send a message you dont do that in the paper you do that internally and he has never said anything to me
2623146 i dont know who it was directed at but if he had said that to me i would know who he was talking about because i would have asked him for an example
2623147 i want to see his next start well know more tomorrow when he has a bullpen
2623148 i talked to brad today and he said he was fine
2623149 he was feeling for it a bit because of the weather it took him a long time to warm up he did it in stages he was a little tentative a little anxious
2623150 not many staffs are successful doing that we need their contributions down the stretch with manny ramirez we have the ability to have some games and score to beat people but you cant rely on that to be the case we need these guys with experience
2623151 derek you give him the ball and he doesnt make excuses hes good if his sinker is going south instead of sideways hes another guy who pitched well against me for boston
2623152 a eso se ha acostumbrado el hincha el directivo y el jugador

2623194 seorang hamba dihadapkan pada hari khiamat membawa hasanah sebesar bukit lalu ada seruan siapa yang pernah di iniaya oleh fulan boleh datang untuk dibayar maka datanglah beberapa orang lalu mengambil bahagiannya sehingga tiada tinggal satu pun dari hasanah yang banyak itu sehingga hamba itu menjadi bingung lalu tuhan berkata kepadanya untuk mu ada simpanan pada ku yang tidak aku perlihatkan kepada malaikat atau seorang pun dari makhluk ku lalu ia bertanya apakah itu jawab tuhan ia itu niat mu yang kau selalu niat akan berbuat kebaikkan aku tulis untuk mu berlipat ganda tujuh puluh lipat ganda
2623195 barangsiapa yang mengerjakan amal shalih baik laki laki maupun perempuan dalam keadaan beriman maka sesungguh nya akan kami berikan kepadanya kehidupan yang baik dan sesungguhnya akan kami beri balasan kepada mereka dengan pahala yang lebih baik dari apa yang telah mereka kerjakan

2623201 maka keluar rohnya mengalir bagaikan titisan dari mulut kendi maka langsung diterima dan langsung dimasukkan kedalam kafan dan dibawa keluar semerbak harum bagaikan kasturi yang terharum diatas bumi lalu dibawa naik maka tidak memalui rombongan malaikat melainkan ditanya roh siapakah yang harum ini dijawab ruh fulan bin fulan sehingga sampai kelangit dan disana dibukakan pintu langit dan disambut oleh penduduknya dan pada tiap langit dihantar oleh malaikat muqorrbun dibawa naik kelangit yang atas hingga sampai kelangit ketujuh maka allah berfirman catatlah suratannya di illiyin kemudian dikembalikan ke bumi sebab daripadanya kami jadikan dan di dalamnya aku kembalikan dan daripadanya pula akan aku keluarkan pada saatnya maka kembalilah ruh ke jasad didalam kubur kemudian datang kepadanya dua malaikat untuk menanya siapa tuhan kamu maka dijawabnya allah tuhan ku lalu ditanya apa agamamu dijawab islam agama ku ditanya bagaimana pendapat mu tentang orang yang diutuskan dikalangan kamu dijawab ia utusan allah ditanya bagaimana kamu mengetahui itu dijawab aku membaca kitab allah lalu percaya dan membenarkannya lalu terdengar suara benar hambaku maka berikan kepadanya hamparan dari syurga serta pakain syurga dan bukakan untuknya pintu menuju ke syurga supaya ia mendapat bau dan hawa syurga lalu diluaskan kubur sepanjang pandangan mata kemudian datang kepadanya seorang yang bagus wajahnya dan harum baunya seraya berkata terimalah khabar gembira ini saat yang telah dijanjikan allah kepadamu lalu ia berkata siapakah kamu jawabnya aku amalmu yang baik lalu ia berkata ya tuhan segerakan lah hari khiamat supaya segara aku bertem dengan keluarga ku dan kawan kawan ku

2623274 sister you are not going to leave i wont allow your love for this autobot to thrive any longer
2623275 you were born a decepticon and you were raised as one no sister of mine will have the heart of an autobot
2623276 thats right and thats the way its going to be until your damn attitude changes
2623277 for the life of me i cant image that being a proportionate response to the charge that georgia has attacked russian peacekeepers
2623278 its hard for us to understand what russias plan is here
2623279 ik ben vlaamsgezind geworden op de normaalschool net als veel van mijn leeftijdsgenoten
2623280 nog nooit heb ik iets gedaan voor vlamingen alleen ik heb ze altijd samengenomen met de nederlanders omdat onze gemeenschappelijke ervaring een verruiming is wanneer vlaanderen en nederland hun krachten bundelen maak je de vijver een heel stuk groter het verschil tussen 6 miljoen vlamingen die nederlands spreken of 22 miljoen nederlandstaligen is toch wel bijzonder groot ik ben dan ook voor een zo groot mogelijke vijver
2623281 met de middelen waarover vrt beschikt vind ik de kwaliteit van de vrt heel behoorlijk maar het is evident dat als je maar een klein aantal mensen hebt je daar uit moet putten wanneer je systematisch een maand naar de vrt kijkt zul je heel wat dezelfde mensen zien velen zijn door die talloze tv optredens al helemaal opgesleten je ziet tussen de zenders heel vaak het gevecht om iemand die goed is zoals jan leyers elke zender zou die man willen want slechts enkelen kunnen zijn programma de weg naar mekka zo goed en rustig presenteren als hij bij het maken van zulke kwaliteitsprogrammas heeft vrt uiteraard geld nodig en daar ligt tegenwoordig het probleem overheidsmiddelen schieten tekort waardoor de openbare omroep gedeeltelijk afhankelijk wordt van commerci le inkomsten dat is een gevaarlijke situatie ik ben ervan overtuigd dat de commerci le zenders absoluut vrede zouden nemen met een grotere overheidsdotatie voor de vrt zo blijven er immers meer commerci le inkomsten over voor de commerci le zenders vandaag kennen we een trend naar een onzuivere gemengde omroep waar kijkcijfers aan belang winnen tegenover de kwaliteit die fetisj voor kijkcijferdichtheid is dodelijk de liberalisering van de sector is absoluut funest voor de openbare omroep
2623282 dat is correct maar ik stel me de vraag of een publieke zender wel entertainment mo t brengen naar mijn mening niet ik ben niet voor de versimpeling van radio 1 en klara ookal is hier absoluut geen meerderheid voor te vinden ik ben de culturele hond in het kegelspel wat dat betreft
2623283 intellectuele lezers komen niet vaak voor in de politiek als je kijkt naar de huidige situatie zijn er helaas te weinig intellectuele lezers daarover maak ik verder geen grapje de mededeling is al treurig genoeg
2623284 wij als belgen zijn goed geplaatst om te weten wat voor reusachtige hindernis de taal kan zijn
2623285 je moet het ene doel voor het andere niet laten we hebben zowel het spoor bewandeld naar de franstalige belgen als naar de rest van de wereld in 1972 schreef ik een franstalig boek over de cultuur van nederland en vlaanderen cest une main tendue la francophonie als ze ons willen leren kennen moeten ze gewoon dat blad lezen het is zelfs in hun eigen taal
2623286 de kern van de zaak is dat vlaanderen en walloni elkaar niet meer kennen zelfs binnen de partijen is er geen overlegstructuur meer het opbod en de stoerdoenerij van de partijleden heeft ervoor gezorgd dat we in deze situatie terecht zijn gekomen door die fanatisering verlaten politici steeds meer het pad van de wijsheid en overleg als je felle uitspraken en beloften van de wever of maingain hoort dan weet je van tevoren dat dit niet tot oplossingen leidt het is als in een huwelijk of relatie als je als 2 personen wil samenleven moet je met elkaar rekening houden want buren blijven we hoe dan ook
2623287 de franstaligen nemen de hele cultuur mee wanneer ze ergens gaan wonen de taal krijgt dus voorrang op het grondgebied hier wringt het schoentje want wij vlamingen denken daar anders over vroeger zijn er 500 000 vlamingen ge migreerd naar walloni en allemaal pasten ze zich aan de voorouders van de waalse politieke klassen komen bijna allemaal uit vlaanderen denk aan een spitaels vancauwenbergh enzovoort wij hebben ons aangepast maar de franstaligen doen dat niet
2623288 de geschiedenis is belangrijk maar op een bepaald moment moet je naar de toekomst kijken stop met kankeren over wat er mislukt is kom naar buiten met een oplossing en sta niet steeds te kwekken over wat je gaat zeggen en wat er al dan niet gezegd is de vlaamse politiek is t lang een politiek geweest van miskenning voor mij is de afkorting van vb vlaams belang eigenlijk vlaamse beerput wij voeren politiek op basis van een vat vol eeuwenlange frustraties dat moet nu eindelijk stoppen als het belgische project al mislukt tussen 2 gemeenschappen wat dan met het europese
2623289 de globalisering en europese eenwording zorgen ervoor dat we met onze eigen taal en cultuur scherper en pittiger omgaan uiteraard is er ook een dreiging aan verbonden want het engels is de meest vervuilde taal van de wereld mensen die geen engels kunnen spreken het zelfs overal zie je affiches met be young be smart dat kan men toch ook gewoon in het nederlands zeggen niet
2623290 het belang van goed schrijven en spreken in de eigen taal is belangrijk voor iedereen als je het niet goed formuleert is het ook niet goed bedacht mijn levensmissie is daarom nooit af nooit rond het is een permanente zorg die ik probeer door te geven aan de generaties achter mij want de bladen boeken en bundels die ik uitgeef zijn ook voor hen al te vaak blijft cultuur binnen dezelfde generatie deze inteelt is zeer jammer daarom blijf ik doorgaan doorgaan alsof het nooit eindigt
2623291 en daarna stage doen bij een immobili nkantoor dat is mijn droom
2623292 met de vriendinnen een dagje shoppen een gezellige romantische komedie bekijken of eens stevig uit de bol gaan
2623293 ik heb heel wat bewondering voor de plaatselijke bevolking want ondanks hun leed blijven ze geloven in de toekomst
2623294 veel liever zit ik in mijn thuisstad knokke heist waar ik alles en iedereen ken
2623295 je gaat undercover wanneer je je voordoet als een gewone burger maar wel verslag uitbrengt als journalist
2623296 als waakhond van de democratie heeft hij het recht n de plicht om wantoestanden aan te klagen
2623297 anders dan bij de politie is het de taak van de journalist om iets dat blijft woekeren terug onder de aandacht te brengen
2623298 het is als het ware een rappel aan de overheid van doe er iets aan
2623299 zowel het vermoeden van onschuld als het recht op privacy zijn belangrijke ijkpunten
2623300 media kunnen aan deze regels tegemoet komen door te werken met rasters en initialen
2623301 daders kunnen ontsnappen aan hun veroordeling wanneer de journalist de dader onvoldoende onherkenbaar heeft gemaakt
2623302 deze journalisten willen vooral geen hulpje zijn van de politie
2623303 het laatste dat journalisten willen is dat men hen gaat zien als medewerkers van de politie
2623304 wanneer er een systematisch patroon zit in het doorgeven van vertrouwelijke gegevens aan de politie zullen mensen minder geneigd zijn om informatie aan journalisten te geven
2623305 al meermaals werden journalisten bedreigd of aangevallen door bijvoorbeeld hooligans omdat men hen als medewerker van de politie beschouwde
2623306 een journalist valt onder de wet tot bescherming van de journalistieke bronnen
2623307 dit wil zeggen dat het de journalist vrij staat om gegevens door te geven aan de politie
2623308 wanneer de fysieke integriteit van n of meerdere personen wordt geschonden kan een journalist wel verplicht worden om zijn gegevens door te geven
2623309 als het zo ernstig is dat levens in gevaar komen is er uiteraard geen twijfel om je gegevens door te geven maar dat wil niet zeggen dat je dat als journalist systematisch moet doen
2623310 wanneer een burger getuige is van een misdrijf en niets onderneemt kan hij veroordeeld worden
2623311 het wordt zelfs de politie weinig gegund om zelf strafbare feiten te plegen dus voor een journalist kan dit uiteraard ook niet
2623312 het is wel belangrijk dat je je taak als journalist ernstig neemt en niet vervalt in sensationele berichtgeving
2623313 enkele elementen liggen moeilijk binnen de partij maar dit is slechts een vertrekbasis

2623315 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2623316 i have lost 46 friends in the war i hate to bust your bubble but i have i have lost 46 marines in iraq and i deal with it everyday by having good friends not attending therapy but talking about it being open about it
2623317 now the old king is dead long live the king
2623318 would it unearth you to know that there is a part of my heart that you cant touch
2623319 its wrong to suppress your feelings to leave anger unresolved rahel
2623320 my counselor who insisted that i call him roger told me
2623321 how about if i can get you a gs500 for close to the same price
2623322 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2623323 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2623324 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2623325 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2623326 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2623327 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2623328 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2623329 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2623330 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2623331 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2623332 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2623333 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2623334 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2623335 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2623336 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2623337 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2623338 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2623339 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2623340 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2623341 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2623342 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2623343 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2623344 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2623345 we are disappointed that the state has decided to take this action we firmly believe that the facts in this matter support our position and our legal counsel has advised us that our position is strong the company will vigorously defend this matter and we look forward to having the courts decide the merits of our case
2623346 we have a real product that we sell to real customers see all these sales to distributors we promise that we think they actually sell them to customers
2623347 i spent 35 years getting to know real estate in many metropolitan areas
2623348 and i pride myself to have all the information at hand when it comes to evaluating a deal i think information is very very important in ones decision process so i have another 32 years to try to catch up in the football business
2623349 but having the experience in real estate i hope it doesnt take that long
2623350 im not considering moving the team im not considering selling it so i think that question at this time is
2623351 were working very hard to bring forward a plan that hopefully we and the legislators can work on and move it forward as was promised to us when the twins and the gophers resolved their issues
2623352 as i have said many times as time goes on and with the cost of materials going up the way they do the task becomes more daunting
2623353 we feel that the location of the metrodome is really the gateway to downtown minneapolis
2623354 these guys are trying to invest in an economic development package
2623355 but hes trying to kind of sweeten the pot a little bit or at least make it easier for state leaders to participate in a difficult project by saying im going to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the economy and create jobs and economic development in a time that couldnt be better to do it
2623356 i found wilf to be straightforward and friendly and obviously a very savvy businessperson
2623357 i think the vikings are a pretty important community asset but there is not any proposal before anybody the issue will have to be discussed by minnesotans and well have to decide how to proceed
2623358 its not easy but were trying to do what we can for the short term for the next year or two
2623359 our lease is up in 2011 we want at least to have whatever revenue enhancements we can
2623360 and we set our goals very high we expect to win the division
2623361 we pride ourselves to be more developers than real estate investors
2623362 were a family that whatever we build on we hold on so were long term players
2623363 my dad and my uncle knew nothing really about the business of football they loved to watch the game
2623364 he tries to watch but usually its my mother who watches and she relays the results to my father
2623365 i think as we get better the nervousness will wear off
2623366 this is similar to other businesses in the sense that its still all about having the right people and the right character and right personalities
2623367 but its different in that sports and the vikings in particular so many people care about it so many people are passionate about it
2623368 ive been very fortunate to work with a bunch of very good owners
2623369 i think the wilfs are unique because and all owners have passion to win and things but i think the wilfs take it a step further just as far as having a total family atmosphere and applying that how they run their own businesses how close knit their families are how close mark and zygi and lenny are applying those same principles to here
2623370 i feel like a fan first and as a fan i want to have a chance to win a championship
2623371 thats the fan in me who wants to win and wouldnt mind the owner spending the money to get us that championship so i speak as a fan and as an owner that our primary goal is to win championships
2623372 at first when we came in as ownership it was a very exciting time
2623373 following our passion for football and being involved in such a storied franchise it was more like a kid enjoying his fantasy being involved meeting the players but like anything else it wore off not the fact the passion wore off but the fact that realizing the responsibility is much greater than what it seemed at first
2623374 our philosophy is that were very blessed in our business
2623375 we want to make sure that we give back and the vikings have a great tradition of that so were really just building on a tradition that was there already
2623376 dream come true to be involved in ownership in the nfl

2623386 if all our misfortunes were laid in one common heap whence everyone must take an equal portion most people would be content to take their own and depart
2623387 if you are christian why are you here i explained that many of the biblical sites were important for me and i considers this to be spiritual journey he did not understand but offered me some cheetos and iced tea
2623388 youll love traveling with us we have more room than airplanes
2623389 were not sure where they are right now but theyve been notified
2623390 a cease fire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2623391 all those actions and signals we have seen are not things which would not be conducive to a cease fire
2623392 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on nonuse of force with south ossetians
2623393 expressed grave concern on the further deterioration of the situation
2623394 and it is clear that the conflict has now expanded to other areas of georgia than only south ossetia
2623395 regrettably i have come to the conclusion it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground in the council on a draft statement to the press
2623396 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2623397 a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2623398 kori jones japan airlines has sent your bag it is at reception
2623399 nuclear war is not beautiful or interesting at all but there most disappointing brutal and most complete form of destruction nothing touches the heart
2623400 we have fans that love us and we have to show that spirit its very difficult for your players but you have to move on we only had hours to get ready to play
2623401 this is the first time in my life to deal with this before a game
2623402 i have to have patience and let our players get over it to help them deal with it
2623403 you kind of accept it more when its a natural occurrence
2623404 but you dont accept it when its violence then to be a coward and kill himself come on he just ruined an entire family ridiculous amounts of people are affected by that
2623405 shes a very good christian girl but now you have to think what if it wasnt her father it was her
2623406 the thing about it is i can come in with a lot of things on my mind but when i start to play i can put them all aside and focus on one thing
2623407 all who work here are not money minded people but servants of god who choose to help the poor over themselves

2623425 why care about everyone else anything you do to help others is insignificant in the history of the earth so might as well worry only about yourself and your family

2623427 the thing that you really need is something that you cant catch even if you chase after it its something that you had in yourself since the beginning

2623429 the single most important thing you can do in businesses is be yourself

2623432 all in all i thought we played some good footy
2623433 it was just a shame we maybe could have kicked a little straighter to take away some of that i suppose hope that they had maybe up to the first quarter
2623434 we might have reduced that and it might have been a little bit easier
2623435 it is pleasing to have over a 10 goal win i dont think weve done that for a fair while at the club
2623436 i think the players felt maybe a bit of relief there that it was not always scratch and fight and crawl and just trying to get a win up
2623437 its great that the light flickers or the opportunity still sits there but for us the main thing was getting back on the winning wagon again
2623438 were dedicated to giving our players an opportunity to sink or swim and also the young players an opportunity to develop their game and an understanding of how tough it is and how good the opposition are
2623439 by the start of next year we hope them to be a lot better prepared for a better season
2623440 given that wed only kicked one goal those couple of goals got them three goals and all of a sudden they were a couple of goals in front
2623441 on that basis we would have played for another six months and not picked them up that changed the game
2623442 there was plenty of recognition for crawf and goo brent guerra in his 150th game today but more importantly we got the four points that makes it a certainty to finish in the top four which is what were after
2623443 now weve had the disappointment of being taken apart on the scoreboard so its going to take all our resilience and our determination to ensure we come up again next week
2623444 but that indefinable confidence would have to be a little bit shaky over a couple of guys
2623445 fades shows creativity and effort its all about the image your trying to convey

2623448 the results of cross assiduous reporting show through in every chapter a remarkable portrait a
2623449 this is the first to take an authoritative journalistic and scrupulous look at the history of cobain and his band
2623450 the short unhappy life of kurt donald cobain now has its worthy biographer
2623451 heavier than heaven will likely stand forever as the definitive kurt cobain biography
2623452 shakes up the prevailing conceptions of cobain a compelling biography
2623453 the tapes of bill english lockwood smith and nick smith capture a mixture of cynicism and arrogance which will make some people seriously doubt the veracity and durability of john keys assurances that national does not have a secret batch of right wing policies to be implemented once the party is back in power

2623457 the logical decisions that management makes in order to sustain success ultimately are the same reasons they lose their positions of leadership thus the dilemma thats because once established most technologies over time foster improved performance these are sustaining technologies but occasionally these sustaining technologies are up ended by disruptive technologies in many cases the disruptive technologies actually had worse performance in the near term and generally underperformed the sustaining technologies in the mainstream market so these are not break throughs in the performance sense but they are generally cheaper quicker smaller and simpler than the existing competition they concentrate on a few features that new fringe customers heavily desire and they ultimately disrupt the status quo marketplace

2623466 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
2623467 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
2623468 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
2623469 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
2623470 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
2623471 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
2623472 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
2623473 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
2623474 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
2623475 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
2623476 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
2623477 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
2623478 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
2623479 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
2623480 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
2623481 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
2623482 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
2623483 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
2623484 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
2623485 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
2623486 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
2623487 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
2623488 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
2623489 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
2623490 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
2623491 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
2623492 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
2623493 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
2623494 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
2623495 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
2623496 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

2623506 equal grounds to consider ourselves as distinct from jews as jews do from us
2623507 as a black man is in danger just by going to the gas station
2623508 c apitalization is governed by the nature of the word not by a political or racial agenda
2623509 jewish identity connecting jews to other jews comes from deep within jewish history
2623510 that jews have suffered is undeniable but jewish suffering is claimed to have been so enduring so intense and so particular that it is to be treated differently from other sufferings the issue is complex and cannot be fully debated or decided here but the following points may stimulate thought and discussion skip but none of this is the point whether those who question the holocaust narrative are revisionist scholars striving to find the truth and shamelessly persecuted for opposing a powerful faction or whether they are crazy jew haters denying a tragedy and defaming its victims the fact is that one may question the armenian genocide one may freely discuss the slave trade one can say that the murder of millions of ibos kampucheans and rwandans never took place and that the moon is but a piece of green cheese floating in space but one may not question the jewish holocaust why because like the rest of the jewish history of suffering the holocaust underpins the narrative of jewish innocence which is used to bewilder and befuddle any attempt to see and to comprehend jewish power and responsibility in israel palestine and elsewhere in the world
2623511 look were a religion no a race no a cultural entity sorry a religion
2623512 the jewish people as a whole will be its own messiah
2623513 anti semitism is nothing but the antagonistic attitude produced in the non jew by the jewish group the jewish group has thrived on oppression and on the antagonism it has forever met in the world
2623514 your boys may be on their way to that war tonight and you you dont know it any more than you knew that in 1916 in london the zionists made a deal with the british war cabinet to send your sons to war in europe
2623515 i am going to use a word you hear the word you read the word and you use the word jew as though it is something that could be weighed and felt has a background im going to use that word although i never use it in my own personal affairs or in my private life now i want to explain that dr samuel johnson wrote the first english dictionary in 1797 thats only a few years from 1800 which isnt so very long ago it consists of two thick volumes and it has possibly every word that was then used in the english language i have shown that to many important people in all walks of life and they were amazed because when i told them what i am going to tell you now they didnt believe me so i acquired these two books cost a little money theyre first editions rare in that book in those two volumes the first english dictionary ever published by dr samuel johnson about whom many of you know the word jew does not appear the word jew does not appear that word was coined forced on you stuffed down your throats by control of all the media by the people who are interested in leading you to slaughter
2623516 the conspiracy for world dominion through a world slave state exists and cannot at this stage be abruptly checked or broken off of the momentum which it has acquired it now must go on to fulfillment or failure either will be destructive for a time and hard for those of the time in which the denouement comes

2623535 i often write about how it is hard to review teen books as an adult you just dont think like a teenager anymore so sometimes adult reviewers can get frustrated by how teenagers act barbara shoups wish you were here is so pitch perfect though that as the child of divorced parents whose mother remarried when i was a teen well let me just say this woman knows of what she writes she nails so much of the frustration of that situation it is eerie flux has reissued the book it came out in may and im so happy with it expect more in my august column

2623538 when i first told robin about my history i could see her connecting in a way that displayed a combination of humility empathy and sympathy a rare trait for anybody in a society thats too busy to communicate in ways that are more complex than a one sentence e mail
2623539 robin in fact is on a short list of people in my life who i believe can connect with people on an emotionally deep level she has a sincerity as well as a raw and honest but affecting laugh that can put the most unrefined person at ease
2623540 the book industry screws artists in lots of ways but im beginning to think the greatest crime its perpetrated is forcing writers to accept its convenient marketing categories as meaningful to the value of their work

2623542 i wasnt sure what to expect and even if id been told what to expect i dont think it would have prepared me for what i found to say that this book is about grief and moving beyond grief isnt sufficient it took me by surprise with its strangeness and beauty and glimpses of humor amid the darkness

2623546 teenage is the time of passage between childhood and adulthood in traditional societies this passage is accompanied by rites which suit the psychological demands of the transition but in modern society the high school fails entirely to provide this passage
2623547 we believe that teenagers in a town boys and girls from age 12 to 18 should be encouraged to form a miniature society in which they are as differentiated and as mutually responsible as the adults in full scale society therefore replace the high school with an institution which is actually a model of adult society
2623548 if a teenagers place in the home does not reflect his need for a measure of independence he will be locked in conflict with his family
2623549 to mark a childs coming of age transform his place in the home into a kind of cottage that expresses in a physical way the beginnings of independence keep the cottage attached to the home but make it a distinctly visible bulge far away from the master bedroom with a private entrance perhaps its own roof

2623553 id say its probably four things that have been driving it one is economic obviously the effect on housing and the total economy has some effect on you when customers cant pay their bill they either downgrade or drop off completely and watch free tv particularly on some of your low end type customers second issue would be piracy and fraud as you know our system has been has been compromised and its compromised in two ways third thing then is its really competitive is really competitive offerings in the marketplace the biggest being probably the phone companies and fios and u verse where there are a lot of introductory offers and offers out there that and i think they had about 300 close to 303 000 net additions in the second quarter so they have taken those some from us and some customers from others obviously in the high definition front we havent been as competitive as we would like in the second quarter particularly versus directv and finally operational efficiencies really in two ways one is just our total overall customer service in terms of are we giving customers a great experience and are we doing everything right so customers dont have to call us and we certainly have we certainly made some progress there
2623554 starting as of august 1st we were at 114 hd national channels i believe directv talked about being at 100 channels last year i think the latest thing i saw they were at 95 channels in august 1st so they talked about last year having 100 channels they didnt meet that goal we were actually the first company to have today i believe 114 national hd channels including one thats in 1080p for video on demand so thats true video on demand so weve made progress there although thats in the third quarter obviously not in the second quarter
2623555 we have a satellite being launched by a canadian company in the fourth quarter of this year that we have leased all the capacity on that should be operational by the first of next year we then have echo14 launching i think the end of next year then we have echo15 in 2010 i think its reasonable to expect that we would launch something in the neighborhood of one satellite per year end up with 10 satellites in our fleet that are operational and they while they have 12 to 15 year lifetime i think were on a kind of a path of one a year to add capacity
2623556 i think as soon as the next satellite gets turned on we have a chance to be more aggressive than we are today were a little bit more aggressive today obviously and were doing a couple of different things the first big thing we do we have the only 8 all hd package so if youre going to buy an hdtv set and you dont want to put anything on it that is not hd were the only guys that have the system for you to do that right and it starts with less than 1 a day so thats pretty aggressive but its aggressive in a way that its from a pricing point of view its pretty aggressive from a packaging program and packaging point of view as well if you go to a cable company before you can get it youd probably be buying 50 of products before you get your first hd channel its a kind of add on tier so its competitive in that market
2623557 but we have 10 or 15 channels probably in 1080p that well put up

2623560 i didnt get called up that kind of got me perturbed they didnt invite me to big league camp and i was a little perturbed about that too i told them i dont know what else i need to do to get called up here i guess that was the closest i came to making it to the big leagues

2623565 we are disappointed with our revenue performance in the quarter and certainly are not immune to the challenging economic conditions
2623566 despite these conditions we remain optimistic about the continued transformation of deluxe
2623567 begin to shift our portfolio from traditionally mature print related markets in decline to business services markets that are growing
2623568 it is interesting for this first quarter that your revenue declined 8 percent and on a year to date basis they are down 7 percent so you are talking about a pretty dramatic reversal
2623569 yet you are telling us that you think longer term you can grow mid single digit so we are having a hard time bridging that gap
2623570 obviously the stocks been down and it is down an awful lot what probably scares investors here is that you are talking about a potentially huge organic decline that has occurred over the last 18 months
2623571 the play here is with the people who are bearish they are seeing that even with these new services results wont turn around in the short or near term say in the next two quarters but long term investors orientation is different and they are definitely seeing a lot of value in deluxe
2623572 but for long term and patient investors this is definitely a good entry point into the stock
2623573 absolutely believe that sooner rather than later we can start getting some top line growth
2623574 synergistic capabilities will bring them along obviously we would not have done them if we did not think these things were going to help us a lot

2623584 early this morning the seattle police department received notification that one of our officers was involved in an off duty shooting in sturgis south dakota
2623585 we believe that four other off duty seattle police officers were present when the shooting occurred
2623586 the seattle police department considers this a matter of utmost seriousness
2623587 all five officers will be placed on administrative reassignment relieved of duty pending further investigation by the south dakota authorities

2623599 the first couple days training here it was just kind of like whoa but today maybe the air was a little bit thinner it wasnt crazy bad for us
2623600 the conditions were just so humid and so hot it was just a real war of attrition today
2623601 will they be able to perform up to the level of their conditioning given the pollution its less about long term health risks thats not the issue
2623602 we tried very hard to work out in the worst part of the day and we stayed out there when it was hottest
2623603 we are not seeing any supply issue for tellurium we have a couple of sources and we have locked down our long term contracts for raw materials that has helped us maintain the supply as well as the price
2623604 its an awful lot of hype as opposed to a lot of reality
2623605 no one has come up with a full blown production setup and that has soured all the venture capital and private equity companies
2623606 within a relatively short time we will have gigawatt factories
2623607 today were looking at 1 50 per watt and by 2010 our goal is going to be 0 70 per watt
2623608 where we play is in the very sunny high solar resource areas where its also very warm
2623609 however even if polysilicon came down in price significantly first solar could cut their prices and still see the same margins that the traditional module makers do
2623610 it would definitely hurt them on pricing but they would still be extremely profitable at lower prices

2623619 the outlook that i have on the united states military is completely different now
2623620 i have a huge amount of respect for what they do its a job that not everybody can do and not everybody is willing to do with the sacrifices that they make day in and day out and being away from their families as long as they are they work 16 hours a day everyday to me the job is amazing
2623621 the difference in going from iraq to afghanistan is stark
2623622 driving through kabul we saw more clearly just how much a reality the war is having to ride in a convoy in a humvee with guards protecting us made me concerned for the first time on this trip it was my first time going to a war zone i was anxious and nervous at the same time i was really excited about going but also there was the fear of the unknown

2623629 their anger is because somebody else overpowers them instead of fighting with each other they should come together and create positive art

2623645 im hoping the huge increase in the number of applicants is because we have a reputation
2623646 and because people have noticed the new theatre and recognized the potential of training
2623647 weve had some dark days asking ourselves whether we should keep the program
2623648 one of the key things is a certain autonomy and self reliance
2623649 our students have a sense of independence and understanding of what goes on behind the scenes
2623650 it will be justified it will be fixed everything will be documented and it will be corrected
2623651 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day

2623671 i tried everything second seems to be my place what can i say every time he wins i finish second and unfortunately every time i finish second he finishes first weve got to change that
2623672 you got to go you got to go hes coming
2623673 it was the opportunity to play strategy and i give the total credit to tim cindric
2623674 this is one of the first races where we didnt have the car but we took chances
2623675 we have got to start capitalizing on these cars that can win these races
2623676 dixon had a bit of speed on us but i think we had a better car in traffic it was between him and i to win this race and i think it is just unfortunate
2623677 you have to give a lot of credit to the fans because they wanted to show theres an interest in this sport
2623678 were a performing team here weve always been trying to sell a good product
2623679 bruton will have an opportunity to come in here and justify some of the situations that are going on
2623680 are deal was if you dont like some of the details send the contract back
2623681 i think that what can happen is well be doing a lot of things here and i think anything that we do is going to make the indycar series better as well as nascar
2623682 if you could wave a magic wand and the lawsuit was dropped we would go to work on getting a race and try to change their mind
2623683 im not bitter im just dissatisfied and unhappy and i feel bad that the team that we had the race track that we had they have both completely been put into a second class kind of atmosphere
2623684 with the opportunities weve been given we did as good a job as we can
2623685 we started 20th moved up to 12th and were running really well i could have easily driven up another few spots
2623686 we just have to figure out what happened to the right rear bearing well give them something to run with in chicago
2623687 senator mccain continues to be stubbornly committed to the bush administration position of an indefinite military presence in iraq despite the fact that the iraqi government is calling for a timeline despite the fact that the iraqis are sitting on tens of billions in oil surplus while our economy is struggling at home despite the impact on our troops and despite the deteriorating situation in afghanistan
2623688 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2623689 it will be notional and aspirational dates but it will be based on conditions i know that
2623690 they will be times that we hope they can be out by they will be based on conditions on the ground not according to hard deadlines
2623691 the first gig we ever played in the u s was in detroit and we have always had an affinity with this part of the country pete and i are very aware of the problems people are having in michigan and feel we should give something back for all the support we have had over the last 40 years
2623692 air travel is fun air travel is fun air travel is tons o fun nonstop fun air travel is
2623693 i took him inside gently sat him down and googled it
2623694 and so mom ate me and i was a seed and i was in moms stomach and then i grew and grew up big and popped out of moms face and my face came out of her face and i was big and strong and i did that i really popped out and and
2623695 i like hot stink i like hot stink i like hot stink i like hot stink i like hot stink i like hot stink
2623696 there were countless snags one of my friends figured out that you could order a negative quantity of books and we would credit your credit card and then i guess wait for you to deliver the books to us we fixed that one very quickly
2623697 hearts of hope now hopes to build a dorm room to house up to 10 young women along with adequate restroom facilities any small donation even just 50 or less will help as the costs of such a dorm are minimal it amounts to less than 3000
2623698 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
2623699 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
2623700 sends a message to all of the countries in the former soviet space that russia is resurgent and is willing to flex it muscles
2623701 i thought our guys competed very hard it was their fifth practice in three days and yesterday we got after it with the pads its a tough game played by tough people and the mountaineers right now are playing pretty tough
2623702 his legs are tired hes been running a lot its not anything bad what that is is tired legs and it was just precautionary plus needed to play i told you all we wont have any hesitation playing no 14 at quarterback
2623703 i thought he stepped up in the pocket and threw a couple strikes
2623704 brad starks is a natural now im hoping he can be the starting slot wideout guy and then be the third quarterback but some things dont always go as planned it was good for him to play and now he knows he will be forced into the situation
2623705 hes built like a man and hes going to bring another threat to our already powerful offense it will be a nice change up to
2623706 i was pleased with the one defense on the goal line
2623707 we put the ball on the near hash with no time left on the clock and its used for the end of the game we sent in our fast hurry up field goal team and it worked out okay
2623708 you are wrong its the light the northern light the light that rules darkness rules me you are blessed to have seen it i am not let me take you there where it awaits with life and let it forgive the curse laid on me
2623709 immensely profitable of a few individuals at the top and a complete ripoff for most everyone else

2623711 while the chinese internet audience has continued to grow so has the interest in targeting this large economy through paid and natural search
2623712 at least dean martin knew how to put on a good hour fulla sly sexual innuendo and barfly gags galore right
2623713 its totally bent up and mangled the shaft ripped out of the hull
2623714 it must have been an ungodly scene for anyone on board the stern had to be leaping up and down like a horse
2623715 literally but looking for an old fashioned type that knows how to open doors and how to treat a lady
2623716 i spent 35 years getting to know real estate in many metropolitan areas
2623717 and i pride myself to have all the information at hand when it comes to evaluating a deal i think information is very very important in ones decision process so i have another 32 years to try to catch up in the football business
2623718 but having the experience in real estate i hope it doesnt take that long
2623719 im not considering moving the team im not considering selling it so i think that question at this time is
2623720 were working very hard to bring forward a plan that hopefully we and the legislators can work on and move it forward as was promised to us when the twins and the gophers resolved their issues
2623721 as i have said many times as time goes on and with the cost of materials going up the way they do the task becomes more daunting
2623722 we feel that the location of the metrodome is really the gateway to downtown minneapolis
2623723 these guys are trying to invest in an economic development package
2623724 but hes trying to kind of sweeten the pot a little bit or at least make it easier for state leaders to participate in a difficult project by saying im going to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the economy and create jobs and economic development in a time that couldnt be better to do it
2623725 i found wilf to be straightforward and friendly and obviously a very savvy businessperson
2623726 i think the vikings are a pretty important community asset but there is not any proposal before anybody the issue will have to be discussed by minnesotans and well have to decide how to proceed
2623727 its not easy but were trying to do what we can for the short term for the next year or two
2623728 our lease is up in 2011 we want at least to have whatever revenue enhancements we can
2623729 and we set our goals very high we expect to win the division
2623730 we pride ourselves to be more developers than real estate investors
2623731 were a family that whatever we build on we hold on so were long term players
2623732 my dad and my uncle knew nothing really about the business of football they loved to watch the game
2623733 he tries to watch but usually its my mother who watches and she relays the results to my father
2623734 i think as we get better the nervousness will wear off
2623735 this is similar to other businesses in the sense that its still all about having the right people and the right character and right personalities
2623736 but its different in that sports and the vikings in particular so many people care about it so many people are passionate about it
2623737 ive been very fortunate to work with a bunch of very good owners
2623738 i think the wilfs are unique because and all owners have passion to win and things but i think the wilfs take it a step further just as far as having a total family atmosphere and applying that how they run their own businesses how close knit their families are how close mark and zygi and lenny are applying those same principles to here
2623739 i feel like a fan first and as a fan i want to have a chance to win a championship
2623740 thats the fan in me who wants to win and wouldnt mind the owner spending the money to get us that championship so i speak as a fan and as an owner that our primary goal is to win championships
2623741 at first when we came in as ownership it was a very exciting time
2623742 following our passion for football and being involved in such a storied franchise it was more like a kid enjoying his fantasy being involved meeting the players but like anything else it wore off not the fact the passion wore off but the fact that realizing the responsibility is much greater than what it seemed at first
2623743 our philosophy is that were very blessed in our business
2623744 we want to make sure that we give back and the vikings have a great tradition of that so were really just building on a tradition that was there already
2623745 dream come true to be involved in ownership in the nfl
2623746 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2623747 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2623748 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2623749 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2623750 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2623751 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2623752 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2623753 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2623754 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
2623755 time to die poor mates you made me what i am

2623764 if john edwards believes america cant win the war in iraq he should convince his democratic counterparts including sens obama and clinton to immediately cut off funding for the war and bring the troops home
2623765 he was wrong about the surge hes been wrong about iraq and hes wrong in the way he describes whats happening in iraq right now
2623766 he was wrong about the surge hes been wrong about iraq and hes wrong in the way he describes whats happening in iraq right now
2623767 the american people said very clearly in the election in november that they want a different course the congress is now meeting its responsibility
2623768 the president needs to sign that legislation if he vetoes it they need to send him back similar legislation again
2623769 so that everybody in the community will know that all those government vehicles are safe to be on that road and i think its important
2623770 if zeimers combat career was brief so was his training
2623771 but zeimer had missed the intense four week pre iraq training a taste of what troops will face in combat that his 1st brigade comrades got at their home post in october instead zeimer and about 140 other members of the 4 000 strong brigade got a cut rate 10 day course on weapon use first aid and iraqi culture thats the same length as the course that teaches soldiers assigned to generals household staffs the finer points of table service
2623772 the truncated training the rush to get underprepared troops to the war zone is absolutely unacceptable says representative john murtha the pennsylvania democrat and opponent of the war who chairs the house appropriations defense subcommittee
2623773 matthew had come home on leave nov 8 after more than five months of basic training
2623774 individuals who enlist under the 13x infantry option attend field artillery osut one station unit training which combines army basic training and field artillery ait advanced individual training all in one course
2623775 staff sgt thad rule with the u s army recruiting office in glendive said matt joined the future soldier program at the start of his senior year of high school shortly after he turned 17 he spent nearly 10 months learning some of the basics about the army preparing him for his training
2623776 rule said matt wanted to do a combat job and couldnt wait to join the army to speed things up he opted to undergo artillery support training rather than going into the infantry a move that got him into the army a month earlier
2623777 matt was 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed maybe 175 pounds when he went in for basic training
2623778 he was proud as a peacock when he came home for the holidays
2623779 the army and the white house insist the abbreviated training was adequate they can get desert training elsewhere spokesman tony snow said feb 28 like in iraq but outside military experts and zeimers mother disagree the armys rush to carry out president george w bushs order to send thousands of additional troops more quickly to iraq is forcing two of the five new brigades bound for the war to skip standard training at fort irwin calif these soldiers arent getting the benefit of participating in war games on the wide mojave desert where gun jamming sand and faux insurgents closely resemble conditions in iraq
2623780 after leaving the u s on jan 13 damon said matt went to kuwait for additional training before shipping out to iraq on jan 25
2623781 under cover of darkness sunni insurgents were attacking his new post from nearby buildings amid the smoke noise and confusion a blast suddenly ripped through the 3 ft concrete wall shielding zeimer and a fellow soldier killing them both

2623792 shahrizat bought the house from ambiga what does that tell you
2623793 if mothers could learn to do for themselves what they do for their children we should have happier households let the mother go out to play if she would only have courage to let everything go when life becomes too tense and just take a day or half a day out in the fields or with a favorite book or in a picture gallery looking long and well at just two or three pictures or in bed without the children life would go on far more happily for both children and parents

2623817 we recommend for inclusion amongst others the right to trial by jury the right to administrative justice and international human rights as yet not incorporated into uk law
2623818 we believe that there is a strong case for detailed rights for children and we recommend that the public should be consulted about including specific rights for other vulnerable groups
2623819 we want to see a bill of rights that would set the bar for the universal standards to which everyone is entitled and fills the gaps in the protection of more vulnerable people such as the elderly children or people with learning disabilities

2623901 today at 8 30 a m while driving along pacific coast highway with my 6 year old daughter i got a call confirming that elisabeths father was stabbed to death
2623902 im in shock and not prepared to speak to those girls about this yet what could i possibly say
2623903 i just cant imagine whats going through her mind right now
2623904 wiz has always been a dedicated athlete and teammate team has always come first to wiz just like family and that is because of the qualities instilled in her by todd and barbara
2623905 wiz worked tremendously hard as an athlete to pursue and live her dream of being an olympian always with the support of her parents her character driven lifestyle and her determination has earned her many friends and fans through her illustrious career
2623906 its a situation in which your mind races wondering who could have been involved
2623907 the fact that elisabeth was there and witnessed it well she doesnt deserve that
2623908 how could it be that during a defining moment in your life such a tragedy as this could touch your family its got to be difficult for him
2623909 im sure i would have grown up in the business and would have worked there in any after school job but weve all kind of led our own path
2623910 oh lord why me but you know what it have to be you because it always cannot be me for you need to take on some of these challenges would you not want to live through some of these challenges so that you can be an inspiration to your children or a mentor for a love one
2623911 its been a good first four practices with good days weve been able to meet walk through and then practice theres been good enthusiasm and im pleased so far we have a long way to go but theres effort enthusiasm and guys are trying so that part of it has been very good
2623912 theres been a lot of speculation as far as the stadiums completion and there being something tied into my contract theres nothing like that at all this contract got negotiated a long time ago and certainly there were a lot of things talked about like ive said all along as long as rutgers and the state of new jersey are committed to being the best we are going to grow responsibly and i think thats what weve done there was speculation that there is some letter or an addendum to my contract that says theres a buyout and theres no such thing did we talk about it yes could i of had it if i wanted yes but im part of something bigger than just football im part of rutgers university and i thought the commitment was there so i didnt want to do things that way when youre part of something there has to be trust
2623913 ive been at a few places so theres always some dissent its not just at rutgers no matter how popular the program is theres always a fraction that doesnt agree with it but i dont feel any pressure and i dont think our players do i tell people all the time this university and its governance made a decision long before i was the head coach that they were going to be a major college football program part of that is joining the big east conference and along with that goes certain expenses or certain things you have to do if youre going to be competitive again as ive said all along this place is very special to me but one of the reasons it is special is because we want to be the best were going to do it the right way but were doing everything we can to someday be the best football program in the country that goes with academically and weve quite frankly pretty much have gotten to that now all we have to do is keep it up as far as the academic performance of our players in relation to the rest of the country we got to 12th in the country in 2006 and that was great but its what have you done for me lately so we have a lot of challenges ahead of us but i think and feel a great deal of support from our school the state of new jersey our administration and our governor personally i think theres a lot of excitement i think sometimes the squeaky wheel gets the grease and thats part of life i dont worry about it
2623914 i shrug it off im afraid that when youre born and raised in a place and most of your family still lives there i feel bad for them because they read it and nobody knows how youre feeling what is important to me is these kids the staff and my family we have great people around here and thats one of the biggest assets with bob mulcahy director of athletics and kevin macconnell deputy director of athletics we have guys that are tirelessly working to help this program then when you look at this coaching staff i think its just really really good and then our players they are our strength without them this program goes nowhere and we have great young men in our program not only football players but people all that is what i focus on and its fun
2623915 i think when you have a program you have young players that are known about during recruiting but then you dont hear from them for a year or two but just because youre not hearing from them doesnt mean theyre not getting better and better they are and you guys see them at practice but the general public doesnt see them all the time because theyre not quite ready to go play in the game when you have a program all those people are in place and now theyre just waiting their turn and were getting there are we there at every position not quite yet but i look at some of the competitions that are going on out there on the practice field and i would love to say yes we are getting closer
2623916 the neat thing about college football is every year you lose some guys to graduation and you have some new guys come in now when you lose a guy like ray rice who did so much for your program its hard its not coincidental that things really took off during his time here now he certainly had a great supporting cast and ray would be the first one to tell you that but rays a phenomenal football player and a great teammate to have and were going to miss him having said that kordell young mason robinson jourdan brooks and joe martinek have looked really impressive so far thats spring time and now do we have a ray rice no we dont but we have other guys and theyre going to do their best and i think their best is going to be pretty good we lost two starting tackles a starting guard a defensive tackle and some guys in the secondary just like every team but theres a great deal of competition out there between qualified people and i think like the old saying the cream will rise to the top that will happen
2623917 i think were close right now we have some young guys on the offensive line that are going to be really good football players is it going to happen by september 1 i dont think so theres where the continued progression is going to be critical and can we stay healthy until theyre ready i hope so if not they are going to have to play
2623918 hes doing well so far hes done everything i was happy when our trainer told me he could do everything besides two a days and we dont have many of those hes rehabbed incredibly well and hes been able to hold up so far todays a big day because itll be the first time he gets hit on it live
2623919 you go with people youre comfortable with so you have some kind of relationship thats been my history im very hesitant to go outside of people we know once in awhile weve done it and been successful but im very happy with the staff right now i think theyve worked incredibly hard not only in football but also in recruiting and in mentoring their players but academically and in other ways in their life i think this staff is really coming together well but we havent played a game so well see
2623920 on offense its going to be mike teel and tiquan underwood as the two captains on defense we actually have jason mccourtyfour captains pete tverdov kevin malast courtney green and jason mccourty so we have six captains which ive never done i havent been a head coach that long but in seven years ive never done that im excited about it i think theyve done a very good job our whole leadership team has done a good job
2623921 weve had a few guys come back off injury which is good zaire kitchen is really playing well hes kind of picked up where he left off where as last time he came back from knee surgery he really struggled for awhile charlie noonan has come back from surgery and really come back as his old self damaso munoz missed the entire spring and i was concerned if hed be ready to go at the beginning of camp he really busted his tail to be ready and hes playing well damaso and ryan dimperio and in the middle of a great competition
2623922 on defense theres some good competition going on inside at tackle because we dont know who its going to be that backs up pete tverdov at the tackle position alex silvestro and blair bines and some of the young guys are really competing also its competing for what we have about eight guys so its a matter of who gets to start the game and who gets more reps whos the 40 rep a game guy and whos the 20 rep a game guy
2623923 offensively i think theres great competition on the o line for some of the depth of the line kevin brock is our tight end but theres really good competition for whos going to be our second tight end and when we go two tights whos going to get on the field
2623924 we recruited him to be an offensive tackle but we happened to have two multiple year starters at both positions so we didnt want to tip the boat there we scheduled anthony in at guard and he met our expectations and became a starter but the plan all along was to move him out to tackle during his sophomore year after he came here he was pretty heavy and over the course of time he has gotten himself down to where hes 315 320 lbs and we need him to come through big at the left tackle spot everything indicates that he will but he has to go do it
2623925 what do we need to be successful now if they can help us win now were going to use them as long as theyre on board ive never redshirted a kid or played a kid if he wasnt on board with it i learned a lesson a long time ago when i wasnt a head coach but was part of a staff that did that and the guys heart wasnt into it we didnt get his best it has to be a consensus that its whats best but as a head coach you can certainly lead that consensus a little bit but some guys are just adamantly against it so i wont force the issue i dont believe in that
2623926 i think those six captains are definitely leaders one of them is a repeat captain in mike teel mikes our quarterback and a multiple year starter so if you said theres one guy its probably mike but i think all six of captains are really looked up to by their teammates
2623927 its mainly for men who are exhausted by the summers heat

2623935 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2623936 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2623937 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2623938 sometimes i think im from another world when i try to tell a woman just actually where i stand at i want a girl when i want a girl but when i dont want a girl i want a girl who understands that and thats some hard sh t to explain to a woman thats in love with you its a pitiful thing
2623939 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2623940 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2623941 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2623942 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2623943 the ceilings were white then too i was always told that white was supposed to calm you ya know make you feel like the room was bigger and cleaner didnt work so well in the school bathrooms they still smelled like piss and clorox one of those smells you could only stand for long enough to pee and get out always hated it floors were dirty too i dont think they ever really cleaned them the janitors i mean i think they just let it get to where it smelled like that because it drove us kids nuts vengeful little minds theyd have if so huh
2623944 im sorry to interrupt but you sound as if youre conflicted you speak of him fondly but with such anger did he cross you in some way
2623945 my game plan was to work my way to the lead
2623946 once i did i controlled the pace and no one was really gaining on me i really didnt have any anxious moments today
2623947 the racing surface wasnt as fast as last week when we set a new world record miller continued
2623948 ive won big races but this one is real special since i grew up in ohio and everyone involved with harness racing talked about the adios im happy for everyone associated with this horse
2623949 were just thrilled with the win this is our biggest win ever and largest purse that weve ever won as a two year old we just had no racing luck in the big races in drawing outside posts
2623950 when i was 14 years of age i quit school and was working for cecil champion we were at the meadows when the great and late stanley dancer won the adios with albatross here i am today winning the adios with shadow play what a thrilling moment
2623951 but im really happy for all of his owners they are great people and have been in the sport of harness racing for a long period of time i really didnt have any concerns after last weeks big mile he came back sound and thats all one can ask for this is a very nice and he deserves to get his due place with the other adios winners
2623952 they came at us today but our horse withstood the challenge he raced great i cant win any stanley cups anymore but this is quite the feeling

2623959 certainly a steady hand and a calm hand at the wheel at all time

2623961 they still came back to support her former high school teams
2623962 it was just a great great couple supporting the programs and supporting the school
2623963 he never wanted to be above anybody their comments were always positive it never appeared to me in all these years ive known him that he was above anybody else i never got that kind of impression they were great human beings
2623964 he was just so incredibly supportive as a father of an athlete some people can get a little worked up at sporting events but he was just there in the stands waving his flag whether it was for team usa for ucla or for lakeville
2623965 it was a reaction that i dont even have to describe
2623966 i wanted to leave now but why is that dead body covered in motor oil bleeding from its anus with two bloody knives and a pole laying next to it

2623975 european commercial and political involvement in china thus developed a momentum of its own
2623976 the true protector of the chinese against the rapacity of the other imperialist powers
2623977 japans policy would be influenced more by britain than by any other government
2623978 acquired strategic commitments thousands of miles from home and altered the whole distribution of power in the world
2623979 it was inevitable that christianity would be misunderstood and that the most diabolical motives would be attributable to its propagation
2623980 guan county can justly be characterized as geographically isolated politically weak militarily ill defended and with a population increasingly restive
2623981 despite the reforms of 1898 the chinese army was still one of the least effective in the world generally speaking the troops were badly paid badly feed badly housed badly armed and badly trained above all they had bad officers
2623982 by the last decade of the nineteenth century china had become an area where the great powers were confronting each other chinas gradual political and social disintegration seemed to invite foreign intervention and the race for spheres of influence in china climaxed as the century drew to a close
2623983 theory that people and societies like animals and plants compete for survival and by extension success in life formulated in the late nineteenth century social darwinism built on the theory of natural selection as described by british scientist charles darwin social darwinism was employed by some as the philosophical underpinning for imperialism racism and unbridled capitalism
2623984 coined the phrase survival of the fittestto describe the competition among human individuals and groups
2623985 great britain since the opium war had more citizens in china than all the other european powers combined and had staked out a zone of commercial domination in the lower yangtse valley
2623986 russia in china the russian reaction to the boxer rebellion
2623987 an undisguised desire to utilize the opportunity of the boer war for the strengthening of russias position against england it was reluctantly agreed that not much could be immediately undertaken in this regard but the alliance with france was revived and directed now in express terms against england
2623988 shantung was rapidly converted into a sort of oriental prussia with
2623989 kaiser wilhelm who had a gift for the vivid but unfortunate phrase making sent his brother prince heinrich to the china station with a number of warships and the admonition if anyone at all should try encroaching on our rights go at him with a mailed fist
2623990 unlikely that any european power would have placed its armies under the command of a japanese general
2623991 benefited from the trading concessions exacted by the british from the chinese in the treaty of nanking in 1842 then through most favored nation privileges american missionaries benefited from a french chinese treaty providing for toleration of christianity
2623992 american trade with china hovered around one percent and with japan two percent of total american foreign commerce
2623993 the first open door note set forth the doctrine of most favored nation treatment in the spheres of influence and the leased areas of china it was sent in the fall of 1899 in the form of identical notes to russia great britain germany france italy and japan in march 1900 hay announced that he received final and definitive acceptances although all the replies were actually ambiguous the second circular note sent in july 1900 called for the preservation of chinese territorial and administrative integrity as well as equal trade opportunities no formal replies were requested
2623994 firstly the open door policy as suggested by the united states did not mean that the united states was opposed to aggression in china it only meant that the united states demanded a share of the loot that is why the united states raised no protest against the spheres of influence established by the european powers but only put forward the principle of equal opportunity for all this meant i also want to share the privileges you enjoy in china you get your share and i get mine lets all get our shares lets continue to recognize the present chinese government and enjoy in common all the privileges in china such was the gist of the open door policy
2623995 before the treaty of tientsin in 1858 there were only a handful of protestants and not a great many roman catholics
2623996 towards the close of the year 1898 there was serious trouble in the northern part of the province of kiangsu for two seasons there had been partial failure of the harvest at time due to lack of rain and at others to floods official corruption greatly aggravated the evils experienced and when famine threatened the whole country began to be infested with bands of thieves and robbers
2623997 moreover especially in the northern proinces for more than twenty years after 1875 no single year was free from natural catastrophe such as great floods and droughts with which the administrative resources of the manchu government were inadequate to cope
2623998 in january 1898 it was reported that 48 counties and districts in shantung were suffering from famine what made the situation more unbearable was the corruption and inefficiency with which local authorities handled the relief
2623999 a huge refugee problem created mainly by the flood of 1898 but also by repeated lesser floods going back to 1892 aggravated an already desperate situation
2624000 a number of historians have pointed to the decisive importance of the summoning of the legation guards in late may
2624001 the church has set out for easter it is a journey of penitence or of deep review of our life we are called to examine our practical acceptance of the gospel to help us in this effort the church points out to us a path that can be summarized in three words prayer fasting almsgiving prayer can have many expressions personal and communal but we must above all live its essence listening to god who speaks to us in addition to being an external practice fasting which consists in the moderation of food and life style is a sincere effort to remove from our hearts all that is the result of sin and inclines us to evil almsgiving far from being reduced to an occasional offering of money means assuming an attitude of sharing and acceptance we need only to open our eyes to see beside us so many brothers and sisters who are suffering materially and spiritually thus lent is a forceful invitation to solidarity
2624002 what is the essence of poverty true poverty is first and foremost an acknowledgement a realization of
2624003 the contemplative life and the active life have always been contrasted as springing from contrary thoughts and aspirations contemplation gathers in action gives out the one seeks for light the other longs to bestow its possession on others but real life does not admit of such a separation thought and action have the same father the monk works with his hands or undertakes some apostolate the great doctor has his hospitals the artist his exhibitions action should have a limit and give place to solitude because external action disturbs the soul while silence calms it but carried too far silence in its turn has a disturbing effect one can lose ones balance
2624004 christ my child many would like to live a more prayerful daily life they desire the peace which comes from a closer union with me still they will not do what it takes to reach this heavenly peace let me tell you how to achieve this limit your activities to a few useful projects and abandon all useless interests to do this you will have to control some of your present desires when you have limited your interests you will have more time to turn your attention to me this deliberate separation from all useless interests is necessary for you if you are to come closer to me such interests are like chains around your mind they tie down your attention and prevent you from turning easily to me throughout the day to few know how to give me their full attention for any length of time too many people are continually absorbed in unnecessary distractions
2624005 the failure of the other to conform to my hopes is not necessarily the fault of the other
2624006 such situations invariably tempt me to reevaluate my original commitment and to reassert the question of durability concerning the affective element of my availability to the other
2624007 where does one find the strength to meet the demands of fidelity the ground of fidelity necessarily seems precarious the only way in which an unbounded commitment on the part of the subject is conceivable is if it draws strength from something more than itself from an appeal to something greater something transcendent
2624008 when it doesnt turn out like the fairy tales said it would
2624009 if were living the gospel we dont get every need every help every preference every luxury met
2624010 in examining our needs in the light of the gospel we find this if you have all of your needs met all of what helps you met most of your preferences met and most of your luxuries met you are not living a gospel life you are blind to the real world especially the poor
2624011 we cant saturate ourselves with what other people need for basics and still be living a gospel life
2624012 if somebody has no coat give him yours and your shirt as well
2624013 ask yourself if your stuff makes you feel good if you really need it if its outdated if it inspires you if your life will change if you let it go
2624014 its because you moved everything to make room for christmas decorations
2624015 in wealthier nations when hard times hit we cut back on discretionary spending we eat out less frequently we cut back on movies we are more careful with our energy usage the destitute who are already barely existing on less than one or two dollars a day are faced with enormous price increases on the staple foods on which their very survival depends what do they cut back on
2624016 because he asks it of us out of love for him
2624017 parents teachers educators ministers and priests must all remember that our responsibility is not to form change or transform young people but to be good shepherds our role is not to manipulate people or to make people in our own image we are gardeners we put water on the seed and remember that the seed has its own life our responsibility is to help people find their inner freedom people belong to themselves before they belong to their parents they belong to god
2624018 it is very significant for our spiritual life that jesus always asked for some small effort from his followers before he performed his miracles the blind man was told to wash in the pool before he could see the loaves and the fishes had to be brought to jesus before he fed the multitutde and at cana the earthen vessels had to be filled with water which was turned into wine god does not transform the world or individual souls through miracles alone he expects our cooperation he only asks for works that are possible for everyone small deeds done with great love the very simplicity of the deed itself is part of our humbling experience we are made fully aware that it is not our insignificant actions but the power of god that is at work in us
2624019 when as a superior it was necessary for st john of the cross to correct his subjects he was cautious lest through impatience or anger he would succeed only in saddening or discouraging them
2624020 he made his corrections with much gentleness and charity and always saw to it that the one being corrected would not leave his presence sad
2624021 who has ever seen men persuaded to love god by harshness
2624022 a number of years ago i visited a hospital for children with severe handicaps in the middle of the hospital ward was a television which the nurses watched while attending to the children children are terribly intuitive they sense what is happening around them these children knew the nurses were more interested in the television than in them a person knows when he or she is valued and loved we give value to people by the way we look at them by the way we listen to them by the way we touch them and care for them we give value to them by the way we are present to them
2624023 he who devotes himself to the conversion of souls and forgets the wants of his own soul falls into a dangerous illusion god wills that we should love our neighbour as ourselves but not
2624024 if you are devoted to everybody be also devoted to yourself otherwise what would it profit you to devote yourself to everyone if you were to be lost reserve also some time some care for yourself begin by first taking care of yourself in vain would you devote yourself to the care of others if you were to neglect your ownself care for yourself first and last
2624025 she who devotes herself to the raising and education of her children and forgets the wants of her own soul falls into a dangerous illusion god wills that she should love her family as herself but not more than herself that is love of her family should not induce her to neglect herself
2624026 a rule of life also assures of a regular life and of fidelity to the spirit of the carmelite order many people today want to live a spiritual life but often find that they do not know how to organize their lives in a regular way the rule of life helps create a setting of constancy of purpose and disciplined orderly living the rule is a protection against inconstancy and haphazardness and assists your concentration on the goal of prayerful union with god
2624027 when god is loved he very readily answers the requests of his lover this he teaches through st john if you abide in me ask whatever you desire and it shall be done unto you john 15 7 a person can truthfully call god beloved when he is wholly with him does not allow his heart attachment to anything outside of him and thereby ordinarily centers his mind on him some call the bridegroom beloved whereas he is not really their beloved because their heart is not set on him they do not obtain their request until through perseverance in prayer they keep their spirit more continually with god and their heart with its affectionate love more entirely set on him nothing is obtained from god except by love
2624028 we must pray without ceasing in every occurrence and employment of our lives that prayer which is rather a habit of lifting up the heart to god as in a constant communication with him the first end i propose in our daily work is to do the will of god secondly to do it in the manner he wills it and thirdly to do it because it is his will
2624029 i do all for you because you ask it of me out of love for you
2624030 because when a man does something solely for the glory of god he is not disquieted even when the undertaking fails he has already attained his purpose which was to please god god is please because the man worked with a pure intention here are some signs or marks showing that one engaged in a spiritual undertaking is working solely for god 1 he is not disturbed if the work fails since god does not will its success neither does he 2 he is quite happy when others succeed as when he does so himself 3 he does not desire one assignment rather than another but cheerfully accepts what his superiors decide upon 4 when he has finished his task he does not look for thanks or approval and so if ever his work is criticized and belittled he is not afflicted god is pleased and that is all he asks if on the other hand the world applauds he is not puffed up if we have the happy lot to be found worthy to do something that gives pleasure to god what greater reward could we desire it has been said that the pure intention of acting only for the purpose of pleasing god is the heavenly alchemy that transforms iron into gold that is the most trivial actions such as eating working playing sleeping when done for god are changed into the gold of holy love
2624031 whereas relativism that is letting oneself be tossed here and there carried by every wind of doctrine seems the only attitude that our society thinks can cope with modern times we are building a dictatorship of relativism that does not recognize anything as definitive and whose ultimate goal consists solely of ones own ego and desires we however have a different goal the son of god the true man he is the measure of true humanism
2624032 the highest freedom then depends upon a person choosing rightly in terms of what a human being should be
2624033 laymen should make such use of these helps prayer sacraments amp liturgy that while meeting their human obligations in the ordinary conditions of life they do not separate their union with christ from their ordinary life but through the very performance of their tasks which are gods will for them actually promote the growth of their union with him
2624034 whatever you are doing whether speaking or acting do everything in the name of the lord jesus christ giving thanks to the father through him
2624035 through the very performance of their tasks which is gods will for them
2624036 woe to me if i do not preach the gospel
2624037 woe to me if i do not live my family life
2624038 i am seeing children who are being raised to be children all of their lives they are being trained but not in the way they should go in another twenty years the entertainment focused christian youth of today will be the entertainment focused adults who act much like they did in their teen years if the years of ones youth mean one fun activity or sport after another when do children learn to enjoy work must our children always have great fun while being educated will it spoil their childhood if they dont have lots of playtime the essence of proverbs 22 6 is that we reap what we sow
2624039 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2624040 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2624041 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2624042 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2624043 the china of the future will reflect its own culture and traditions but it will also reflect the universal aspirations of mankind and theres no deeper human desire than liberty
2624044 weve advanced both our nations interests by expanding free and fair trade and encouraging the rise of a chinese middle class which can be an enormous market for american exports
2624045 we have also cooperated on other shared challenges from fighting pandemic disease to opposing north koreas nuclear weapons programs
2624046 we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2624047 weve emphasized that being a global economic leader carries with it the duty to act responsibly on matters from energy to the environment to development in africa
2624048 i first visited the country more than three decades ago when my dad was americas representative in beijing
2624049 poverty was rampant and the streets swarmed with bicycles today china is sprinting into the modern era beijing is covered in skyscrapers and filled with cars and the people of china have more connections to the world than ever before
2624050 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2624051 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2624052 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2624053 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2624054 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2624055 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2624056 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2624057 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2624058 techvista microsoft research msr indias annual research symposium features some of the best recognized scientists from across the world as speakers techvista brings together the research community academia and government onto a common platform
2624059 i dont think that is a very good idea for us right now the synergies between our two companies are not particularly large
2624060 that is where our capital and our energy will go
2624061 will your lovingkindness be declared in the grave your faithfulness in abaddon will your wonders be made known in the darkness and your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness
2624062 where can i go from your spirit where can i flee from your presence if i go up to the heavens you are there if i make my bed in the depths you are there if i say surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me even the darkness will not be dark to you the night will shine like the day for darkness is as light to you
2624063 the treasures of darkness riches stored in secret places so that you may know that i am the lord who summons you by name
2624064 we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the surpassing greatness of the power may be of god and not from ourselves we are afflicted in every way but not crushed perplexed but not despairing persecuted but not forsaken struck down but not destroyed always carrying about in the body the dying of jesus that the life of jesus also may be manifested in our body
2624065 the god who said light shall shine out of darkness is the one who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of christ
2624066 i saw dida improve since last season he has proven to be ready physically
2624067 not only is she hot but she plays halo 3 put all that together with that sexy accent and oh lordy im in love
2624068 the more i think about it alto hime only got closer to ranka because he was asked to
2624069 i wonder if what it takes to tip the scales in sheryl favor is for alto hime to realize the very real possibility that he would lose her forever they have been together for some time and share many intimate moments where they confided in one another they have a level of trust that they share with no one else
2624070 what john did to minimize damage in the seventh was as big as the home runs we hit to tie it
2624071 that gave us a chance to do what we did
2624072 that was a great at bat against veras that changed the complexion of the game
2624073 he did a great job behind the plate and he had good at bats all day long
2624074 there is a concern that if it happened again now it would sideline reggie for a long time
2624075 dont speed dont get stopped by the police dont get into an accident
2624076 john if i ever left the dodgers it would be for a guy like you you are a classy gentleman and one of the best guys in baseball but i cant take the job
2624077 you know charles bronfman the expos owner told me you wouldnt take the job
2624078 garret anderson and i were just talking about that how it looked a lot like that 2002 rally
2624079 it was a close game and we blew it up a bit
2624080 that definitely put us on a nice little roll in the postseason that year but right now were not going too crazy with it our goals are pretty high we want to do well at the end
2624081 you dont want to get too far ahead of yourself but weve been putting together games when everyone is putting pressure on the pitchers
2624082 when you do that that second time around that third time around its going to be tough on the pitcher
2624083 it was crazy that was one of the best innings ive been a part of eight runs especially against the yankees thats unheard of
2624084 preocupa me o futuro porque l que vou passar o resto da minha vida
2624085 um dia eu vou morrer e tudo que restar de mim ser o links
2624086 ainda estamos analisando os casos de pessoas desaparecidas na regi o um longo processo
2624087 meus especialistas conversaram com os mccann durante dez horas e afirmaram que eles n o est o escondendo nada
2624088 failure is equal to wrong and as such is bad
2624089 do i actually believe what ive been told about my abilities or about my deserving this
2624090 mas nos termos do velho paradigma de software seu carro chefe era o navegador um aplicativo para desktop e sua estrat gia era usar seu dom nio no mercado de navegadores para construir um mercado de altos pre os para produtos para servidores
2624091 dos aplicativos que fazem o uso dele o nico componente essencial em sistemas cuja infra estrutura de software principalmente de c digo aberto ou de algum modo commoditizado
2624092 com a proposta de n o tratar o software como artefato mas como um processo de comprometimento com seus usu rios os programas s o corrigidos alterados e melhorados o tempo todo e o usu rio participa deste processo dando sugest es reportando erros e aproveitando as melhorias constantes
2624093 i think the beijing games could end up being unique im not sure how many other countries would have either the resources or the control of the resources to be able to put them behind an event like this
2624094 i think london is much more likely to be the model for the games in the future
2624095 i wouldnt be afraid or daunted by these big figures or the scale of what you see in china just hold faith with the great games that were going to host in london in just four years time
2624096 i dont think theres a lot of learning to be had from previous host cities because every host city is different
2624097 hey you guys water boarded some terrorists a few years ago and use video surveillance you have no right to tell us how we beat our political dissidents to death our people can eat now
2624098 oh yea sure we murdered a few thousand protesters and have 90 of the internet censored but look at you and your record so just leave us be
2624099 beware heresy is about to be spoken it is that you might care to take one of the most sublimely constructed and complex of all mechanical cameras and butcher it
2624100 the sacrificial victim is a linhof technika which entered production as far as i know in the early 1960s certainly my 1963 linhof in practice book refers to it
2624101 with this provocative book greenwald a former constitutional lawyer and author of a tragic legacy and how would a patriot act purports to expose the rank myth making and exploitation of cultural gender and psychological themes by the republican party the author begins his attack by targeting john wayne whom he sees as a template for right wing notions of american courage and conservative manliness waynes avoidance of military service and his string of divorces both at odds with his public image are emblematic in this account of a fundamental hypocrisy implicit in conservative mythologies greenwald goes on to argue that prominent republicans from ronald reagan to mitt romney display the same hypocrisy in their public ideologies and personal lives shouldering much of the blame are the press and the media including matt drudge ann coulter chris matthews and even maureen dowd all of whom propagate popular attitudes about virile republicans and effeminate democrats
2624102 do we dare not vote to prevent a worse pilot than w from sitting in the white house

2624145 yes i do she killed her own father i dont think it would bother her that her people are being slayed because of her inability to do her job correctly she doesnt even respect the crowned king and shows it publicly if not for her strong power i would have feed her to the scourge long ago and further more she angers me by flirting and dauntlessly trying to lure my husband to her bed
2624146 adelle i do not want jaina proudmoore nor have i ever wanted her despite her several advances ive been all over azeroth and the outlands ive found only one woman in all of these lands who completes me and thats you adellerose you have my heart and soul no one can take that away from you not even death
2624147 it will take more than some slutty tart to take me from our bed no other woman could ever compare when it comes to my desire

2624149 big words from a big witch eh no adelle rose say what you really feel
2624150 i feel you have not only failed us but that you jaina proudmoore are a failure instead of learning from your mistakes and letting someone else talk with the horde you keep repeating them over and over failure constantly repeated does not sit well with me especially when it depends on the survival of my people and our faction

2624194 what do you call a man with no arms and no legs in the water
2624195 i think just trying to throw every day put a snag in trying to get it better
2624196 a day or two more and i should be back to good health
2624197 by the time we start the oakland series i think ill be ready to go i would like to think i could play tomorrow but if its still lingering a little bit im not going to push it so that will give me plenty of time to get ready
2624198 thats the easy way to put it i want to pitch well no matter what the situation is good thing it wasnt a save situation but you never want to go out there and give up runs
2624199 just to evaluate it i just fell behind hitters i didnt make good pitches and that ended up hurting me
2624200 its been a little bit of an adjustment as far as having more days off and just getting regular work
2624201 getting in the game in situations like that just to get some work in just to stay sharp its been kind of a learning curve for me
2624202 whether or not the whole adrenaline thing with the closer in a save situation is there typically it hasnt been there with him
2624203 i dont think he really cares what inning he pitches
2624204 it was amazing i could go through every adjective i know amazing incredible exciting awesome it still doesnt do it justice
2624205 the best part about it was walking along and looking up in the stands and seeing maple leaves canadians in red standing up and then chinese in red standing up and waving canadian flags so many maple leaves i felt like i was walking into the stadium in toronto
2624206 the coolest part was hearing everyone in the tunnel singing o canada i had chills as i walked into the stadium
2624207 how much does a hot ticket like this go for
2624208 i was told when i picked them up last night that i could have sold them on the street for us 15 000
2624209 for a supposed multicultural world or at least its being pushed on western countries aka white countries there certainly wasnt a lot of multicultural people at these opening ceremonies a lot of black hair
2624210 i was empty at the end just in terms of fuel i just havent had seven hour rides
2624211 the guy that i raced today wasnt the guy who won the tours so i dont put myself in that category
2624212 but it was great of him to come out and do this race and to race with all the people hes a class act out there it was fun we didnt talk a whole lot because it seemed like it was pretty much business
2624213 at the end i realized i was thoroughly cooked but i said i am having a good time
2624214 thats why i wanted to come out here i didnt expect to beat this guy so i just wanted have something out there to shoot for train for stay in shape for and it was a blast it really was
2624215 i wont come back unless im in shape and i feel like im in decent shape you cant show up to this race if youre not in shape so it just depends on how i train id love to be back
2624216 i dont know what happened its got to be flattened by now it was squishing all over
2624217 that was a product of lance and i being together
2624218 it was lances idea i would have never considered that
2624219 its a wonderful life remember the scene where the mob gathers outside the savings and loan then rushes into the lobby when the doors are opened
2624220 we know we have to have a well diversified portfolio
2624221 to say buy nestle because its a swiss company really doesnt make any sense anymore
2624222 what drives a companys earnings what they do or where they are
2624223 global companies that are working hand in hand with government and private entities around the world to build stuff and to help to create the environment where these countries can grow
2624224 its hard to talk about companies in sound bite terms
2624225 was it the brokers who didnt do the due diligence was it the lenders who didnt investigate was it those that pooled the loans as investment securities whose fault is it
2624226 investment quality had been prudently originated and had been properly underwritten
2624227 it was unusual to see these kinds of lawsuits in the past but now theyre becoming much more common
2624228 its the number of foreclosures and the discovery of lending abuses
2624229 lenders are saying to brokers i relied on you guys to get good information on these borrowers
2624230 im reluctant to say all the blame is on the lenders said brent lindahl a member of the mortgage banking group for the twin cities law firm of briggs and morgan
2624231 borrowers were all too willing to take the money when it was available everyone thought the price of housing would continue to go up and that wasnt the case and that turned out to be a problem
2624232 primarily employed persons who have illegally entered or are illegally present in the united states these persons are placed by olen staff co in work assignments with other companies
2624233 have facilitated concealed and derived substantial income from this employment of illegal aliens
2624234 it has been many years since we have used their services it is our policy not to comment on pending litigation
2624235 i talked to our lawyer and he told me not to answer any questions
2624236 we work very hard on convincing business owners to be socially responsible and that means you need to do your job you need to do your documentation
2624237 most of your business is going to come over the internet and youre going to see very few of your customers
2624238 we all hope for successful gas discovery and extraction currently the bulk of the royalties go to the gas companies and a portion to the landowners who deserve this benefit and also to the state of new york but local governments which will be heavily impacted by the gas drilling process must get a long term benefit from this resource
2624239 i propose that the states royalties be put in a dedicated fund for counties where the natural gas is produced a significant percentage of all gas royalties going into this fund would be used for community development projects such as schools healthcare facilities and modernizing local infrastructure that would support family farms and small businesses that way we boost the economy and benefit our communities over a long period of time
2624240 a progressive republican governor named stan hathaway came up with this idea after taking a look at what coal mining had done to the people in west virginia the coal companies kept the profits the state capital kept the royalties and the local economies deteriorated marcellus shale gas is a finite resource lets get long term benefit out of it for ourselves and future generations
2624241 fixed theres 275 users on your machine and one of them is you dont be so selfish logout now and give someone else a chance

2624276 the fragments of fictional prose introducing each level indicated braids ambition they mused on the nature of relationships regret and temporal paradoxes world 2 introduces a limitless rewind mechanic you can reverse any mistake erasing the concept of failure framed by a wistful reflection on perfect forgiveness between lovers it sounds grandiose in summary but its not the connection is never forced

2624285 veremos qu ocurre ahora hay que tranquilizarse y estar concentrado hasta el final voy a trabajar todo lo que puede hasta el final
2624286 tambi n m s de 400 millones de d lares en la ampliaci n y expansi n del sistema de transporte de gas natural que opera transportadora de gas del per tgp y 1 380 millones para aumentar la producci n de l quidos y gas de camisea a cargo de pluspetrol
2624287 entonces es imposible que un pa s duplique o triplique en 12 meses su infraestructura para abastecer de gas a las plantas el ctricas porque un ducto se construye en cuatro a os
2624288 tan pronto se tuvo un reporte t cnico que nos diera certeza de la seguridad se requiri al operador la ampliaci n del sistema que comenz el a o pasado y hoy est en marcha la ampliaci n de la planta de compresi n de chiquintirca y un ducto adicional de 107 kil metros
2624289 entonces el escenario ser a muy complicado por la mayor vulnerabilidad a la tiran a del precio alto del petr leo en el mercado internacional
2624290 ello permitir contar con m s gas natural para atender la mayor demanda de las empresas de generaci n y tener una situaci n m s holgada en el tiempo m s breve posible
2624291 i guess my foul mouth and i are just too offensive for that upstanding and mature group of cheaters pirates market fixers spies liars extortionists backstabbers and egomaniacs
2624292 while coleman natural beef is a relatively small supplier for whole foods market we are extremely disappointed that we must now question colemans assurances
2624293 at whole foods market one of our top priorities is consumer safety and we go to great lengths to ensure the safety and quality of our meats
2624294 we are currently cooperating with the usda the massachusetts department of public health and the montgomery county health department in pennsylvania as part of a routine multi state investigation into these confirmed cases of

2624297 malaysia has failed a major test in nation building to demonstrate that we are shaping up to be a more civil society where sensitive issues of inter faith problems can be discussed in a mature and responsible manner to promote national unity and religious harmony in the country
2624298 such understanding tolerance and sensitivity would undoubtedly have been present in the first four decades of malaysian nationhood and i have no doubt that if such a forum had been organised ten years ago there would not have been the insensitive intolerant and deplorable reaction evident today
2624299 one of the most idiotic movies about american politics ever made
2624300 once you pull off the road you see the trees and the dunes and you kind of forget where you are

2624306 if i believe i could beat up the main character of the movie it is not worth watching

2624308 i dropped the class because i didnt want it to damage my gpa
2624309 as president alan evans must accept responsibility for the groups failure to publicly disclose on time how much money the organisation donated to the labor and coalition parties
2624310 we have an obligation to be involved in the political process in order to advance the interests of our members
2624311 it is important to note that we do not donate money to political parties instead we purchase tables at political functions and events that are attended by members of parliament at both a state and federal level he told the meeting
2624312 internally we have a set of rules that govern this process namely that what we give to one side of politics we give to another in order to ensure fairness and that we only attend those events at which there are representatives from the areas of relevance to our members
2624313 unfortunately this is a reality of being involved in the political process today
2624314 money given at fundraisers flows into the coffers of the major parties and buys influence just like direct donations
2624315 the nrma has no reason to not disclose its political contributions and took steps to ensure its obligation was met the spokesman said
2624316 unlawful proposals that would jeopardise its bid to build the national broadband network
2624317 i dont think it is in telstras interest to be seen to be the company that is still trying to implement work choices ms gillard told abc television
2624318 in a democracy people who want to be a member of a union then the union has got the right to represent them and companies right across the country should recognise that
2624319 i dont think it is in telstras interest to be trying to squeeze the last bit of bitter lemon out of work choices she said
2624320 there are no new awas awas cannot be amended so if people want to move to new arrangements they need to move to a new industrial instrument
2624321 obviously where interest rates are is a matter for the reserve bank and it acts independently and we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates acting prime minister julia gillard told abc television
2624322 but if interest rates were to fall then we expect banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2624323 treasurer wayne swan has already made clear were making it easier for people to switch loans so they can be there looking for the best possible deal
2624324 they were the sweetest family ever they are a really christian family
2624325 they follow usa volleyball they would leave little messages for the players the whole reason they were here is because their life is usa volleyball
2624326 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2624327 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2624328 i shop here because the standards are higher so yes this really concerns me
2624329 maybe this guy isnt acting maybe he is actually this friggin crazy

2624337 okay ive spotted your runners theyre at holts market here in bean station
2624338 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2624339 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2624340 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2624341 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2624342 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2624343 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2624344 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2624345 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2624346 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the inter party dialogue charamba said in the herald
2624347 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2624348 there are things which were referred to the principals and need to be sorted out before president mbeki comes at the moment there is no clear position
2624349 were looking at at least right now 18 feet wide and 15 20 feet high
2624350 when we told one of the people that this is what we were doing he said were going to have to have pull off areas to be able to stop and read it and we thought that was a good idea
2624351 thats the whole idea because if you keep kids involved in athletics and activities and doing things they stay out of trouble so the whole idea was to give them an opportunity and sports is a big thing here in wellington
2624352 now our next goal is to start getting signs up you know start making it happen
2624353 fortalecer a democracia e redefinir o novo cen rio pol tico
2624354 we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement
2624355 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2624356 it is clear that the conflict has now expanded in other areas than south ossetia we see a deteriorating situation in abkhazia
2624357 the georgians must pull out of south ossetia and must agree to sign a document of non use of force in south ossetia
2624358 the ceasefire is not a solution this adventurous gamble has failed the only way to deal is to go to the status quo ante
2624359 the violence has to stop foreign forces have to be withdrawn
2624360 to go as soon as possible to the region to propose to the parties concerned some elements to get out of the crisis
2624361 an immediate cessation of hostilities the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia the re establishment of the situation that existed before
2624362 georgia has struck a deadly blow against its own territorial integrity and therefore to its sovereignty it is hard to imagine how south ossetia can be persuaded to reintegrate with georgia after this
2624363 jika saya disuruh menamakan jemaah yang saya buat ini maka akan saya namakan jemaah pergerakan iman harakatul iman tetapi kita tak boleh menambah nama dalam islam dengan nama

2624366 mike defensor is in the private sector now can not a person as a private citizen prosper
2624367 we dont want people to succeed bakit ganun gaganda ang pilipinas kung gugustuhin natin why is it like that the philippines will prosper only if we want to
2624368 as it is it is not easy to develop bilateral ties with our trading partners but if back home if were not seen as cohesive its hard thats why i said once i return to the private sector i will write a sequel to that book a damaged culture a beautifully written book
2624369 i thought the book would awaken us as a people but it seems the filipinos are still sleepy
2624370 maraming pwedeng gawin ang ating bayan kung magkakaisa tayo our country can do a lot of things if we are united but from what im seeing it brings me to do we philippines want to be helped parang wala tayong magawa na hindi babatikusin e its as if we cannot do anything that will not be criticized
2624371 i feel sad that a very substantive agreement which i thoroughly reviewed has to be given a i dont know what words to use
2624372 leave a legacy of a stable economy so that whoever succeeds her will have something to start with

2624375 you really think youre young enough for the part you were interested in

2624377 we were all there by his bedside he did not go alone he knew how much he was loved and how many lives he had affected by his story
2624378 last year people were picking us to win the national championship game and we went 6 6

2624382 robert says if you want to contact him use myspace
2624383 our goal is for all people regardless of gender sexuality ethnicity or other such things to have the freedom to create their own identity and be respected for their personal qualities
2624384 many parents feel forced to change he to she or she to he and other details as they read stories for their children because so many details in childrens books are so very traditional
2624385 based on prejudice or traditional gender roles that rein in individual freedom
2624386 break down traditional gender roles and offer children broader role models allowing them to be all they can be
2624387 for both vilda and olika their values are the top priority and i think that is simply the wrong approach when you want to make good childrens books
2624388 you cannot write a book simply because you want it to be gender equal you can however write a good book that is gender equal but as soon as you can see the thought behind the book i think the artistic side has failed
2624389 it is perfectly possible to make good literature that takes these issues into consideration
2624390 we have good authors and illustrators and we insist there is a good story that is absolutely the most important thing
2624391 portraying a gay family in a story that is not simply about gay families shows that these families exist too and are just as normal as other types of families
2624392 i really cant see how that can affect the quality of the story itself
2624393 i guess there are people who really feel very threatened when you try to open up perceptions on sexuality and gender identity
2624394 prerequisite that they only take in authors with the same perspective that affects their access to books in a way that just isnt good
2624395 you have too much time on your hands to be giving us so much work
2624396 youre not the boss of me now and youre not so big
2624397 we are the boss of you now and we are so big

2624400 most people when they nod off look as if they need a blanket i look as if i could do with medical attention i sleep as if injected with a powerful experimental muscle relaxant my legs fall open in a grotesque come hither manner my knuckles brush the floor whatever is inside tongue uvula moist bubbles of intestinal air decides to leak out from time to time like one of those nodding duck toys my head tips forward to empty a quart or so of viscous drool onto my lap then falls back to begin loading again with a noise like a toilet cistern filling and i snore hugely and helplessly like a cartoon character with rubbery flapping lips and prolonged steam valved exhalations for long periods i grow unnaturally still in a way that inclines onlookers to exchange glances and lean forward in concern then dramatically i stiffen and after a tantalising pause begin to bounce and jostle in a series of whole body spasms of the sort that bring to mind an electric chair when the switch is thrown then i shriek once or twice in a piercing and effeminate manner and wake up to find that all motion within 500 feet has stopped and children under eight are clutching their mothers hems

2624406 yo tengo un grave problema no soporto a los narradores de la televisi n mexicana de repente se les olvida que est n haciendo televisi n hay unos que piensan que est n haciendo radio entonces nunca te dejan disfrutar de la ceremonia y hay otros que pierden la proporci n y sienten que est n en la cantina con los cuates no es lo mismo estar ante un micr fono habl ndole a un p blico nacional e internacional que estar en una cantina con los cuates

2624410 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2624411 it wasnt until after we put the dogs back in the house and were about to release the fawn that we realized it had six legs
2624412 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2624413 its like theres a semi parked right outside with the engine running but when you look out there isnt one
2624414 it doesnt matter if the windows are open or closed you still hear it
2624415 its like an engine thing a low frequency vibration i think it would be an annoyance
2624416 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2624417 this is an isolated incident we have a single building and a limited number of people affected were relieved to know this problem is contained

2624419 no young people should be put through what these kids had to go through
2624420 they say something is in there but nobody knows what it is
2624421 i feel kind of scared to go back in there because no one knows what it is and it might be something that can kill you
2624422 they didnt tell me anything about whats going on with me
2624423 she went to sleep last night and woke up with her eyes swollen shut
2624424 thats when we found out there were other reports of people with problems
2624425 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2624426 studies have shown that microbes can survive the shock levels of being launched into space
2624427 and as more and more organisms are discovered under extreme conditions its become more plausible that things could survive in space for the time it takes to go from one planet to another
2624428 one hundred years ago people wondered if animals could go from one land mass to another
2624429 everything that is going on on earth occurred because the meteorites happened to land here but they are obviously landing in other places
2624430 if there is another planet that has the water and all of the things that are needed for life you should be able to get the same process rolling
2624431 the case against obama appears to be growing with each passing day we all know there were some problems with his fake birth certificate that was posted on the web recently however i have to admit that at first i was not all that convinced that anything would come of it but today in the rocky mountain news it verified that obama is and has been a citizen of kenya and the united states since 1963
2624432 i work in a restaurant i cant take off a whole shift to go sit in a caucus we need to all be on the same primary system why should 2 000 people in iowa have the same say as 2 million in pennsylvania
2624433 grant will give it a hundred per cent at everything because thats just in his character and hes got nothing to prove to me
2624434 whatever he does im just excited to watch him race because he looks great in the water he just has to get into that head space and thats where hes at and hes just really focused i suspect he is extremely relaxed

2624441 venerable herman of alaska wonderworker of all america a spiritual mission was organized in 1793 made up of monks of the valaam monastery they were sent to preach the word of god to the native inhabitants of northwestern america who only ten years before had come under the sovereignty of russia st herman was among the members of this mission
2624442 the serpent was clever more clever than any wild animal
2624443 do i understand that god told you not to eat from any tree in the garden
2624444 not at all we can eat from the trees in the garden its only about the tree in the middle of the garden that
2624445 one is a colonial model where a few families control the nations resources the other which we defend is based on the nationalization of natural resources for the benefit of everyone
2624446 but in bolivia the press is engaged in media terrorism i know its not you the journalists but the owners of the means of communication they manipulate the news and the polls they lie to the public
2624447 because there were perhaps 20 young protesters compared to crowds of supporters
2624448 although we faced problems with the ioc problems in iraq problems of getting our athletes here because there is no proper flight and no proper visas in the end we did it
2624449 i can confirm that the two policemen were severely beaten up by brazilian troops of the un mission here
2624450 we deplore and condemn this behavior and those at fault should be punished
2624451 i have a friend who can quote david bowie lyrics even before bowie sings a verse

2624455 our first five practices were probably the best weve had since weve been here
2624456 we had some great highlights tonight but overall this was a very ordinary practice
2624457 weve got to achieve above expectations and tonight most of it was just very ordinary we dipped down a little bit today but i expect them to meet our expectations and get back up to that level of play
2624458 dont measure yourself by what you have accomplished but by what you should have accomplished with your ability
2624459 ive seen a million faces and ive rocked them all
2624460 for then there will be great distress unequaled from the beginning of the world until now and never to be equaled again if those days had not been cut short no one would survive but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened

2624462 in humans the categories of gay and straight are socially constructed
2624463 homosexual behavior is of relatively frequent occurrence in the female when she is threatened by another female but it is rarely manifested in response to sexual hunger
2624464 homosexual alliances between mature and immature males may possess a defensive value for immature males since they insure the assistance of an adult defender in the event of an attack
2624465 frontally placed perhaps because selection favored a position maximizing stimulation during the genital genital rubbing common among females
2624466 when one female has hit a juvenile and the juveniles mother has come to its defense the problem may be resolved by intense gg rubbing between the two adults
2624467 in black swans if two males find each other and make a nest theyll be very successful at nest making because they are bigger and stronger than a male and female
2624468 having a same sex partner will actually pay off as a sensible life strategy
2624469 people view animals as robots who behave as their genes say but animals have feelings and they react to those feelings
2624470 as long as they feel the urge for sex theyll go for it
2624471 the behavior in captivity was certainly enhanced in terms of homosexual activity
2624472 cattle evolved in the forest so a visual signal was not going to be useful for them
2624473 no big deal and it increases cohesion among members of that team
2624474 it makes flock life easier and jail flock life is very difficult
2624475 we should be calling humans bisexual because this idea of exclusive homosexuality is not accurate of people
2624476 homosexuality is mixed in with heterosexuality across cultures and history
2624477 better to keep your mouth closed and be thought a fool than to open it and remove all doubt
2624478 i dont know the key to success but the key to failure is to try to please everyone

2624480 a fool says what he knows a wise man knows what he says
2624481 we are what we repeatedly do excellence then is not an act but a habit
2624482 nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves
2624483 no sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the world as it is but the world as it will be
2624484 where there is hatred let me sow love where there is injury pardon where there is doubt faith

2624508 would not drill in the grand canyon i believe this area should be kept pristine
2624509 i respect the rights of the states to control the waters off their coasts but i think we should tell states like california and florida that we will drastically increase the revenues they would receive if they opened up those waters for exploration
2624510 illinois indiana michigan minnesota new york ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin
2624511 as you are undoubtedly aware in 2005 a bipartisan majority in congress enacted a permanent ban on drilling for oil and gas in the great lakes
2624512 drilling in the great lakes would adversely affect millions of americans in the eight states that border these lakes further endanger the ecological web and threaten the beauty of our shores
2624513 seeing as you signed a pledge to preserve and restore the great lakes during your primary campaign i hope your newfound stance on offshore drilling will not be followed by support for drilling in the great lakes

2624517 im fairly confident at this point that what were going to see is the appointment of an independent investigator to make sure that politics is not involved into the inquiry into the monegan firing and if it was motivated by the handling of the wooten case or something else

2624539 if mothers could learn to do for themselves what they do for their children we should have happier households let the mother go out to play if she would only have courage to let everything go when life becomes too tense and just take a day or half a day out in the fields or with a favorite book or in a picture gallery looking long and well at just two or three pictures or in bed without the children life would go on far more happily for both children and parents

2624576 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2624577 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2624578 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2624579 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2624580 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2624581 how do you know if a possum is really dead
2624582 go back to sleep honey ill do the papers for you
2624583 im not going to hurt you im just trying to deliver this last paper
2624584 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2624585 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2624586 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2624587 the one with the naked child running in front of the drum set i was that child well not that child but a child like that

2624594 most importantly business users can obtain enterprise level support from sun but not just sun for either staroffice or openoffice
2624595 the business of supporting openoffice org and for that matter staroffice is in fact growing astonishingly fast around the world the mac element is pivotal too even in areas where you see few macs such as in india though that may be changing too
2624596 but the mac presence grants cios and others tasked with choosing the right software for their organizations the assurance and confidence that they can adopt the opendocument format our native format and the only published iso standard file format for office documents and have an office array that includes macs linux solaris windows and so on
2624597 in short openoffice org and the mac version in particular suture the wounds inflicted by 20 years of divergence the connecting thread is the file format and the understanding that what counts is creating communicating preserving files in a format that resists the fragility of monopoly and the reliance on any one company in fact there is a plugin that gives users the ability to read write odf and with open office 3 0 and staroffice 9 0 well have native support of ooxml which ms office 2007 uses
2624598 staroffice is pitched more to those who want the indemnification against suit by microsoft governments oems and to those who want the ease of having at one go the application plus the most useful extensions
2624599 its also more for those who wish to buy again at the outset the support services training that sun sells
2624600 but support services training are also available for openoffice org and many prefer it over staroffice because it may be in a language that staroffice is so far missing or because an officiating body has insisted that the license of the application be open staroffice is built with open source software same code as openoffice org but the license of the actual application is closed to make modifications one can easily download the corresponding openoffice org code and work with the community

2624836 small minds discuss other people while great minds discuss ideas
2624837 at travelers cafe in october and i will be doing a book signing and reading at semilla hopefully in september i will post the dates once i arrange them
2624838 arts and entertainment magazine every thursday once in a while i have an article appear on a different day but you can bank on thursdays
2624839 you know i could tell something was wrong i even had a customer come over to me once and say gee she looks sad like shes smiling but she
2624840 i dont think im splitting hairs when i say that to accuse anwar of trying to form the government through the back door is unfair
2624841 he has not dangled any inducements to any legislator to join our coalition
2624842 if elected legislators join pakatan rakyat they do so of their own volition and from promptings that have more to do with their perception of who can deliver a better deal to the constituencies they represent than from considerations of personal advancement
2624843 which comes first the development needs of their constituencies neglected over 45 years or their sense of fealty to the party that fielded them as candidates
2624844 action is what is needed to save the nation dangling on a precipice beyond which lies moral squalor in practically every aspect of governance
2624845 the government of abdullah ahmad badawi is patently unable to retrieve itself from this squalor i dont have to trot out the farcical sodomy charge against anwar to substantiate this point
2624846 just look at the accusations leveled against the no i and no 2 in the country on a host of issues ranging from the mongolian womans murder to the misuse of government machinery and funds for party purposes
2624847 before you are done with that there are the doubts about the top cop and the top prosecutor in the land to deal with its a pandoras box of horrors
2624848 a detractor who would go to indiscriminate lengths to lampoon the calibre of anwar would now conceivably be petrified by the looming prospect of his premiership
2624849 hes got to draw his chestnuts out of the fire
2624850 if he were not silent then id concede that chandras strictures on the morality of defections would be hard to ignore
2624851 but when you are dealing with a situation of pervasive moral squalor such as that in the country the notion that you must abide by marquee of queensbury rules is a recipe for paralysis
2624852 this is pure modern electro tekto ragga biz mayhem guaranteed a va le faire
2624853 i like the makossa and megablast remix best the original track is also cool

2624871 yeah disappointing i finished with 67 75 i started alright right 24 25 couldnt get started the second round missed two early then two towards the middle for a 21 and finished with a 22 today so yeah a little disappointed expecting a bit more
2624872 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2624873 im proud of him because politics is dirty especially with republicans
2624874 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2624875 sen mccain is clearly willing to note who he thinks is the aggressor here
2624876 i dont think you can excuse defend explain or make allowance for russian behavior because of what is going on in georgia
2624877 thats kind of like saying after saddam hussein invaded kuwait that kuwait and iraq need to show restraint or like saying in 1968 when the soviet union invaded czechoslovakia that the czechoslovaks should show restraint
2624878 john mccain was there a month ago in this community and was asked a question about this dhl issue and did not say one word about his role in this or the role of his campaign manager that is the furthest thing from straight talk that we can imagine
2624879 we see it as an endorsement of the strategy we developed limo has had an advanced and intricate governance model and now analysts have said the governance model theyre working on for symbian will be very similar so we see it is a validating point for the idea of collaboration and openness it allows us to shift the conversation around openness from debating its merits to talking about tactics
2624880 im not going to have to worry about him because somebody else down south is going to take him out if that man is elected president hell be shot sure as hell the hate would be so deep down south
2624881 the kkk or someone will assassinate obama if we get a n president all you n s sic will think youve won and that the white people will have to bow to you f that
2624882 people on these racist and white supremacist websites are being quite careful because they know that if they make a threat they will very likely get a visit from the secret service
2624883 the scary thing out there is the lone wolf phenomenon there are enough crazy people in this movement that it is possible one of them will decide today is the day to kick off the aryan revolution
2624884 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2624885 our unomig military observers report ongoing military preparation by the abkhaz de facto authorities for a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2624886 this is a conflict that is expanding and getting out of control
2624887 the proximate cause is the massive escalation perpetrated by outside forces
2624888 the georgians have made an offer of a ceasefire and its concerning that the russians wont respond to that
2624889 its clear that the russians are looking to prolong the conflict in some way because they will give no assurances either about a cessation of hostilities or about withdrawing their forces
2624890 there is great dispute and controversy about the origins of this including prior mobilisation of russian troops on the other side of the georgian border
2624891 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia

2624900 even as sirius satellite radio and xm satellite radio strive to convince consumers to pay for a service they have received for free since its inception the nations broadcast radio stations are rolling out new digital technology that delivers better audio quality less interference and a host of new features
2624901 mobile phone users are unlikely to pay extra to access the growing range of video and audio content available on their phones according to a global kpmg survey this trend could push operators into rethinking their business models

2624949 the attorney generals statement that he recognizes what can be regulated on the basis of whether it walks like a duck is an indication that he doesnt understand the law in this area and he is inviting entirely unnecessary litigation against the state of new mexico
2624950 if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then its probably a duck
2624951 we are disappointed by attorney general kings uncharacteristically glib assessment of a serious matter
2624952 further we are disappointed that the attorney general is issuing a verdict through the media prior to his office completing its research on this matter
2624953 election officials are only permitted to regulate public statements that explicitly address elections they are not permitted to regulate public statements that relate to officeholders conduct even though those officeholders may be running for re election
2624954 if the deputy secretary of state thought we had instructed him to simply ignore our letter then that was a misunderstanding on his part of what was said
2624955 in the letter the center for civic policy set forth a number of claims supporting nmyos actions and urged the secretary of state not to grant the attorney generals request
2624956 before they made a decision to disregard or follow the ags advice the sos was asked to let the ags office closely examine the ccps claims and report back that is where the issue stands today
2624957 we wanted to see what the center for civic policy was saying too why they were saying our advice was incorrect or flawed
2624958 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2624959 and we are willing to disengage disengage immediately and as soon as they stop to shoot at us were willing to take any steps first steps required for us
2624960 the reality is that the small nation of georgia is being brutally attacked by big neighbour russia mr saakashvili said as the conflict over control of south ossetia widened well beyond the breakaway region
2624961 russian tanks unprovoked came into georgia into a small nation in the middle of the country
2624962 theyre fighting war and theyre bombing us all around the country theyre bombing us from the west from the east and from the north and from the south they are bombing civilian targets he said
2624963 and the point is this should stop immediately the world should unify time for the world to deal unequivocally to deal with this violence speak with one voice to condemn these war crimes
2624964 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2624965 during these uncertain times pennsylvanians want government to tighten its belt spend their money wisely and provide tax relief wherever possible
2624966 99 percent of the farmers and ranchers want to get rid of the spurge because when they get rid of the spurge they got more grass and things for their livestock they got better production in the fields and i think most of them want to do it and biocontrol is the best agent they have because the chemical works but it takes a lot of extra labor and it is expensive
2624967 you have to go into cancer treatment with a very positive attitude which is not easy for everyone to do but i learned early on that you do need a positive attitude to fight as hard as you possibly can

2624971 these are the best these are colorado peaches theyre not stored in a warehouse for very long and they come up here and you can keep them for a long time in your refrigerator last year i kept mine for 3 weeks
2624972 so this first year i think we will be ok it is if this drought continues to linger on for a year or two
2624973 one of the issues we will have to deal with this field wont be as big of an issue but some of those other fields the empty heads out there we are going to have to figure out a way to shred them and knock out them small heads to get them to germinate before we put the crop in next year
2624974 and in some cases the wheat fields didnt even get a chance to head out
2624975 the wheat and the barley people are turning claims in right now there is nothing there alot of them figure they are not even going to combine it the hay fields alot of them are getting zeroed they are zeroing out the hay fields there is just nothing there
2624976 in our case we are more diversified we got the farming operation we did get some hail storms on our winter wheat up north but fortunately it created an opportunity to go make some feed

2624988 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2624989 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2624990 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2624991 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2624992 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2624993 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2624994 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2624995 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2625000 here in fiji there will be some fairly major changes changes structurally
2625001 we are looking at some vicious investments in fiji we are currently talking with real estate agents because we will be purchasing a building in lautoka
2625002 business in fiji has been quite solid in spite of all of the issues and oil prices and so forth in fact it has been fairly positive and so we are looking forward to good business here
2625003 we are purely confident about 2009 and our development in fiji
2625004 all i was trying to do was the right thing
2625005 the agent said we are going to be watching him we cant be watching you
2625006 they are humans no matter what they do all i was trying to do was the right thing i was just trying to do my job
2625007 its the most significant hospital building boom since after world war ii
2625008 some of our hopes wed placed in technologies have had some setbacks
2625009 i shop here because the standards are higher so yes this really concerns me
2625010 i knew he was a little bit slow and i could see us catching him and to get him on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2625011 i think this is the view dario had on the last lap in chicago last year
2625012 going into turn three i was like finally im going to win a race
2625013 i tried everything second seems to be my place what can i say every time he wins i finish second and unfortunately every time i finish second he finishes first weve got to change that
2625014 you got to go you got to go hes coming
2625015 it was the opportunity to play strategy and i give the total credit to tim cindric
2625016 we have got to start capitalizing on these cars that can win these races
2625017 dixon had a bit of speed on us but i think we had a better car in traffic it was between him and i to win this race and i think it is just unfortunate
2625018 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2625019 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2625020 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2625021 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2625022 i guess the course is going to change quite a bit
2625023 its still going to be playing difficult but probably not to the extreme it was playing the last couple of days
2625024 i made a double bogey at the 18th because i was so mad i was almost fighting for the lead and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the rest of the whole round
2625025 we didnt move fast enough on both sides of the ball id like for the offense and defense to move and play a little faster so we have to work through some things but overall it was a good scrimmage 115 to 120 plays we got in some good work
2625026 for the players they go back out stretch and play they actually played better after the rain delay than i thought they would
2625027 traditionally its not very good when you have to come inside for 45 minutes and head back out
2625028 it seems like every year the majors are getting harder and harder
2625029 this year we have played in a lot of wind almost every week even a normal week on the tour we have played in a lot of wind
2625030 the open championship had winds stronger than the others and then weve had it tough again this week as well
2625031 i would definitely say this year is the toughest set of majors ive ever played
2625032 augusta wasnt easy and the u s open is never easy
2625033 how can you afford such a lovely house do you come from a wealthy family
2625034 lalu i know you come from a poor family how on earth can you afford such a palace
2625035 i was surprised to find a parking spot so close by
2625036 i had to drive 2 hours to get here and we dont make this trip very much so its a hassle
2625037 i can see how some people may be annoyed since its their saturdays
2625038 its just an inconvenient time its a bad weekend and a bad day i mean its back to school and there are a lot of shoppers
2625039 and it is with us that the change of the world well be brought about in a matter of time it may not be with us or even our children but some day our cause will be completed and our glorus undertaking will have brought about a change in the people that have oppresed us for so long
2625040 it is us who will go to hell who must go to hell in order to ler our childern live forever in heaven these men who have attacked us and have now imprisoned us mean to stop us we have chosen to fight back and not a better time could it have been by being here we show the world how commited we are to our cause our famlies know how great we are but the rest of the world needs to know too there is only one thing we can do to prove our greatness and that is to revolt some more
2625041 we will escape form this prison as no prison of theirs can hold us or our ideals
2625042 we well use the bombs if we must to show the world what great men we are
2625043 if you use glitter be prepared to have it on you forever glitter is the herpes of craft supplies
2625044 the earths environment stores energy then all of a sudden it releases it
2625045 the mccain campaign is out with another contrast ad and this one suggests that senator barack obama bears some of the responsibility for skyrocketing gas prices
2625046 who can you thank for rising prices at the pump
2625047 i strongly condemn this attack and will always support israel in confronting terrorism and pursuing lasting peace and security
2625048 senator obama is coming to express his strong commitment to the us israel friendship and to israels security and show his solidarity with israel and its struggles for peace and against terrorism
2625049 weve had a great visit so far starting on friday in kuwait and now here in afghanistan
2625050 first and foremost were here to see the troops to thank them for their extraordinary service and to let them know that we and the folks back home are proud of them
2625051 were in afghanistan because this is the central front in the war on terrorism
2625052 were talking to our military and diplomatic leadership and to the leaders of afghanistan about whether we have the right strategy and the right resources to defeat the taliban and al qaeda and to support lasting stability
2625053 we need a sense of urgency and determination we need urgency because the threat from the taliban and al qaeda is growing and we must act we need determination because it will take time to prevail but with the right strategy and the resources to back it up we will get the job done
2625054 i am thinking this is the week when historians will say that the mccain campaign jumped the shark judging from this weeks management of mccains campaign communications id say the biggest obstacle facing the arizona senators quest for the oval office is his own decision helped by bad advice from his new chief campaign adviser steve schmidt to walk away from the mccain brand
2625055 at a time of great peril and promise war and strife we are blessed to have such a powerful reminder of mans potential for great evil but also our capacity to rise from tragedy and remake our world
2625056 let our children come here and know this history so they can add their voices to proclaim never again
2625057 mr obama seemed to have navigated one of the riskiest parts of a weeklong international trip without a noticeable hitch
2625058 there is a constant and natural tension in the creation of satire the delicate art of satire is suffocated by heavy handed elucidation but if the satirist fails to make the point clearly enough the whole enterprise backfires in unintended misinterpretation
2625059 ronnie and i always waited until everything was decided and then we endorsed
2625060 ooo look at me im making people happy im the magical man from happyland in a gumdrop house on lollypop laaaaaaane
2625061 specifying constraints the constraints in a decision are the restrictions placed on potential solutions to a problem identifying data needed for marketing action often marketing research studies wind up collecting a lot of that are interesting but irrelevant for marketing decisions that result into marketing actions the data should be able to provide manager with information that allows them to make clear choice of action to take for their product determine how to collect data determining how to collect useful marketing research data is often as important as actually collecting the data the two key elements in deciding how to collect data are concept and method concepts are ideas about a product or service to find out about consumer reaction to a potential new product marketing researchers frequently developed a new product concept that is a picture or verbal description of a product or service the firm might offer for sale methods are the approaches that can be used to collect to solve all or part of a problem
2625062 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2625063 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2625064 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2625065 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2625066 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2625067 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2625068 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2625069 should talk to the american people and talk to the world
2625070 i would be very direct with president putin that these actions will have consequences long term in terms of our relationship with russia and it is in violation of the norms of international conduct
2625071 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
2625072 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2625073 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds
2625074 if god forbid we live to see barack obama president we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before and our country will be weakened in every way
2625075 slumps are like a soft bed theyre easy to get into and hard to get out of
2625076 o k thats it im just going to have fun
2625077 why is secretary mike leavitt kowtowing to birth control companies and abortion activists
2625078 if he is seeking to protect conscience rights of those who want nothing to do with abortion he needs to recognize that contraceptives can cause abortions
2625079 any of the various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
2625080 an early draft of the regulations found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review
2625081 it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
2625082 the truth is that life begins at creation and anything that destroys that life is an abortion
2625083 we hope mr leavitt will have the courage to stand for truth against abortion advocates
2625084 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
2625085 it will be accomplished solely through private investment with no new consumer or corporate taxes or government regulation
2625086 you know who is in charge now the gestapo agents at homeland security they are in charge
2625087 every american should be offended and outraged by comparisons between our dedicated public servants risking their lives every day to enforce our immigration laws and the nazi secret police no matter who is making the comparison that such a vile statement was made by a member of congress is truly reprehensible and irresponsible
2625088 ice actions have been entirely legitimate and carried out in a professional manner in an effort to deal with a national illegal immigration crisis
2625089 such a reckless comparison to the gestapo borders in making such comparisons congressman gutierrez is providing license for people to resist by any means necessary
2625090 fair joins with dhs assistant secretary julie myers in demanding that the house leadership take action against representative gutierrez his statement deserves the strongest possible condemnation from his colleagues
2625091 garret anderson and i were just talking about that how it looked a lot like that 2002 rally
2625092 it was a close game and we blew it up a bit
2625093 that definitely put us on a nice little roll in the postseason that year but right now were not going too crazy with it our goals are pretty high we want to do well at the end
2625094 you dont want to get too far ahead of yourself but weve been putting together games when everyone is putting pressure on the pitchers
2625095 when you do that that second time around that third time around its going to be tough on the pitcher
2625096 it was crazy that was one of the best innings ive been a part of eight runs especially against the yankees thats unheard of
2625097 real results by the end of my first term in office

2625109 thats why your seeing 2 3 a pound prices for high grade apples in the store which is kinda tough to swallow
2625110 these gingergolds are the first pick of the season the prices have doubled since last year theyre going for about 300 bucks a fruit bin
2625111 when you can get 200 300 theres profit coming back to the grower
2625112 ill give them the support in return by purchasing their food and hopefully this will keep going on
2625113 we really didnt have any frost in the spring weve been lucky weve had no hail yet this year but a lot of people have in the state of new york
2625114 sometimes you can use them for cider utility apples sometimes just juice it kind of depends on how bad the hail storm is and how long it goes
2625115 youll have storms one town over and you wont have anything the next town so if you have farms in different parts of the area then youre probably better off because you wont get totally hit

2625127 i think the lesson lies to some degree elsewhere it lies in the method of the campaigning the style of the campaigning and the appeal to the electorate and i think we certainly need to look at the early election
2625128 there are lessons clearly but there needs to be a great deal of thought into what those lessons mean
2625129 the conservatives in the northern territory were coming off a very low base
2625130 in many respects the only way was up as far as conservatives in the northern territory are concerned
2625131 and i didnt detect many federal issues running through the northern territory campaign
2625132 the election result is hardly a ringing endorsement for either side of politics law and order platforms
2625133 i think every state is different and has its own unique circumstances
2625134 it was going to be a very tough race up there
2625135 labors opponents up there ran a very very vicious really law and order campaign so i dont think its that unusual in northern territory politics to see this
2625136 very hard working very committed and a very intelligent new young leader
2625137 dijo un portavoz de la casa blanca a los medios
2625138 backed by his friendly southern drawl the practiced charm of a courtroom warrior and a smile bright enough to blind the cameras eye john edwards never lacked the confidence to take the big risk
2625139 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career
2625140 feel invulnerable that they feel it has gone on all of the time that im not going to be scrutinized at this level and it will stay private
2625141 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic

2625146 i liked him before but i dont see any integrity
2625147 the image of him and his wife was very important the image of that union
2625148 i have great things to say about john edwards he opened that window up for our rural community
2625149 it gave something to our community and our students and their families
2625150 i dont think it is in telstras interest to be seen to be the company that is still trying to implement work choices
2625151 in a democracy people who want to be a member of a union then the union has got the right to represent them and companies right across the country should recognise that
2625152 i dont think it is in telstras interest to be trying to squeeze the last bit of bitter lemon out of work choices
2625153 there are no new awas awas cannot be amended so if people want to move to new arrangements they need to move to a new industrial instrument
2625154 its a wonderful opportunity to stand side by side with locals in goolwa and other south australians and say enough is enough we actually need urgent action
2625155 its not good enough for the federal government to sit on its hands and say its too hard
2625156 to save the river we need water and we need it now

2625161 there will be no champion if one does not go through the ultimate pressure
2625162 the coaches can be very dictatorial issuing orders to athletes without explaining why
2625163 some also get angry with us and say were meddling that athletes should just follow their orders
2625164 they need to calm down not see this as the beginning or end of their life but a step along the way

2625178 we had everyone together and had great energy i was really impressed with the young kids and impressed with how our leadership group has taken over
2625179 i thought it was one of the best first practices weve had in the five years that ive been here

2625184 we still dont know what exactly is causing this massive blackout and sesco is still trying very hard to reconnect the supply as soon as possible
2625185 normally this kind of massive blackout is when the state grid got disrupted
2625186 it depends on where the fault is but its all linked the fault could be with the state grid maybe this is quite major

2625189 in its first four days its had 1 8 million hits that shows that the community is very interested in the information it can provide
2625190 the liberal party wanders around saying its all a waste of time presumably they would abolish it presumably they believe in less information for consumers
2625191 but consumers recognise that in a competitive market the more information they can have the better and we agree and were determined to give them that information
2625192 we said before the election the biggest impact on grocery prices was international factors we said before the election the biggest henpeck on petrol prices was world oil prices and that continues to be the case
2625193 the now prime minister and now treasurer were asked can you guarantee to bring prices down they said before the election no but we will do whatever we can to put more competitive pressure in to the market
2625194 the only people who give false promises are those who say things like we can keep interest rates at record lows and promises they no they can never keep
2625195 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2625196 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2625197 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2625198 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2625199 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2625200 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2625201 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2625202 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2625203 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2625211 as for housing the situation has gone from bad to worse in recent days as credit rating agencies announced they will downgrade billions of dollars in bonds backed by risky subprime home loans
2625212 market losses from forced sales are near but there is still little actual credit loss from defaulted mortgages thats still ahead and the loss magnitude will depend on the depth and length of the housing recession based on housing markets early to the distress party colorado the leading example bubble zone foreclosures will increase for at least the next three years announcements of bottom in 2008 are fantasy based

2625220 delinquencies defaults and foreclosures have continued rising especially in the 2006 vintages of subprime lending however so far our assessment is that this risk is likely to remain largely contained

2625241 the court basically told the city that if thats all it has it cant take these homes
2625242 its too late for the city to manufacture more evidence so the courts ruling is a fatal blow to the city we are confident the owners will prevail on remand
2625243 we agree with appellants that in light of the principles laid down in gallenthin the city did not find actual blight under any subsection of n j s a 40a 12a 5 that the record lacked substantial evidence that could have supported the new jersey constitutions standard for finding blight and that the absence of substantial evidence of blight compels reversal
2625244 this victory for the long branch homeowners is a victory for property owners across the garden state sending a clear message that abusers of eminent domain will be held accountable
2625245 this obviously shows that something wasnt done right its vindication
2625246 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa
2625247 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2625248 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees

2625251 shipments in the business jet and turboprop segments continue to rise steadily
2625252 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2625253 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2625254 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market

2625258 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense

2625283 they were very excited about making this trip to china one of the messages that came back was to a friend of todds an e mail after the opening ceremonies letting her know that todd had seen the opening ceremonies and enjoyed them and was inspired by them
2625284 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2625285 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2625286 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs

2625288 well make sure that you cant get around our rules on family reunification by going through back doors
2625289 the government considers the ruling to be wrong its incompatible with the eus efforts at combating illegal immigration
2625290 the european court of justice must not be allowed to determine denmarks policy on foreigners
2625291 its not a matter of just a small corner of our foreigner policy
2625292 im ashamed of a country that supposedly stands for freedom and democracy and has now put so many people in this situation
2625293 if you cant enjoy the game unless youre pretty sure your team is going to win baseball is not the game for you remember the best team in baseball is going to be beaten about 70 times a season

2625301 it was a big break through because its now cheaper to bring in the morphine powder and make it here in a pharmacy
2625302 if to be free of pain is a human right then people should ask their mps to have this service in their constituencies
2625303 its difficult to abuse oral morphine there is no addiction or diversion compared to the tablets

2625305 we can control the pain of cancer of 98 per cent of the patients we treat and have the pain controlled for hiv aids patients they usually get severe pain from infections such as kaposis sarcoma commonly called kisipi in uganda if they have access to the antibiotics fungi then as the infection is cured then we can withdraw the pain killers
2625306 we want to see that this medical specialty come to your home
2625307 this leads to untold suffering for the patients and family
2625308 aids has brought an epidemic of death and increased the urgency fro palliative care services not only in hospitals but in the community and reaching to village level where up to 57 per cent of the population may never see a health professional
2625309 palliative care must reach these people through training of health and non health professionals who live in the villages 20 50 per cent of patients with hiv aids have severe pain aids has brought a great increase in cancers and kaposis sarcoma is now the highest occurring cancer in uganda

2625314 tujuan sertifikasi ini salah satunya adalah untuk memberikan rasa tenang bagi perusahaan dalam menjalankan usahanya karena ada support selain itu juga ada rasa aman dari para penegak hukum yang sewaktu waktu dapat melakukan razia
2625315 ketika mereka datang untuk mau razia mereka sudah melihat piagam ini yang ada lambang polri nya tentu akan memberi faktor psikologis tertentu
2625316 jadi bisa saja ada data yang tidak comply dengan yang ada di sertifikasi tetapi piagam ini akan memudahkan pemeriksaan yang dilakukan kepolisian

2625322 qu gran estrategia intent todo pero el segundo parece ser mi lugar qu les puedo decir
2625323 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2625324 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2625325 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2625326 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2625327 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2625328 india cannot become a nation with islands of high growth and vast areas untouched by development where the benefits of growth accrue only to a few
2625329 the heads of state or government while acknowledging the significant steps taken to alleviate poverty in the region resolved to continue to combat poverty through all available means including especially through peoples empowerment they committed themselves to continuing to share each others experiences and success stories of pro poor poverty reduction strategies such as micro credit systems community driven initiatives and the raising of the consciousness of the poor on their right to resources and development
2625330 the need to continue to address the major barriers hindering effective trade liberalization in the region which include sensitive lists of items and non trade barriers ntbs
2625331 they directed that the decision to revise the sensitive lists by the safta ministerial council smc be implemented early they also recommended that while revising the sensitive lists special consideration be given to the ldcs the leaders directed the safta committee of experts scoe to expeditiously resolve the issue of non tariff measures ntms and para tariff measures ptms in order to facilitate and enhance trade under safta
2625332 emphasized their commitment to implement safta in letter and in spirit thereby enabling saarc to contribute as well to the dynamic process of asias emergence as the power house of the world
2625333 underlined the need for taking concrete measures to improve trade facilitation in terms of the mutual recognition of standards the adoption of common tariff nomenclatures and the harmonization of customs procedures
2625334 they directed the relevant saarc bodies to expedite their work in these areas
2625335 i shop here because the standards are higher so yes this really concerns me
2625336 in its first four days its had 1 8 million hits that shows that the community is very interested in the information it can provide
2625337 the liberal party wanders around saying its all a waste of time presumably they would abolish it presumably they believe in less information for consumers
2625338 but consumers recognise that in a competitive market the more information they can have the better and we agree and were determined to give them that information
2625339 we said before the election the biggest impact on grocery prices was international factors we said before the election the biggest henpeck on petrol prices was world oil prices and that continues to be the case
2625340 the now prime minister and now treasurer were asked can you guarantee to bring prices down they said before the election no but we will do whatever we can to put more competitive pressure in to the market
2625341 were probably going to see gasoline at the retail level around 3 50 for labor day
2625342 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the marketplace
2625343 the biggest driving factor now to the downside is the fact that the u s economy has a lot of company right now in terms of weakening economic growth
2625344 we have decided to temporarily offer you our individual software products at a reduced amount of 20 off retail dont miss this opportunity to secure your device at a discount
2625345 looking at bmws line up with all the gas issues of the day they may be in better shape than lexus said stephanie brinley a product researcher with autopacific she said munich based bmw may pass lexus by the end of the year
2625346 we definitely have enjoyed having that status as the best selling luxury brand said greg thome a spokesman for lexus in torrance california
2625347 that is not our number one goal especially in context of this market
2625348 it is not at all a focus to beat lexus said jan ehlen a spokesman for bmw north america
2625349 all we are doing right now is trying to maintain profitability in the current market conditions
2625350 the brands are getting two different parts of the market mr hall said
2625351 bmw has a much younger demographic and a broader line up with several niche low volume vehicles for which lexus doesnt have a competing model he said retailer just group has recommended shareholders accept a 800m hostile takeover bid
2625352 im not going to indicate what may or may not have been discussed at cabinet but our position is quite straightforward we dont support the use of capital punishment
2625353 when an australian overseas has been convicted and is subject to capital punishment as a sentence we make representations on behalf of australian citizens
2625354 when it comes to other individuals who arent australian citizens well make a judgment on a case by case basis as to whether its appropriate to make representations or to join in representations at a regional or multilateral level
2625355 but the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty
2625356 so i wont be making any individual representations so far as the bali bombers are concerned
2625357 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to the death penalty
2625358 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes

2625387 we knew it was going to be tough they are the best team in the world and it was also a difficult time of the year for us to come out here and play we gave it our all in the first 30 minutes but couldnt maintain the momentum
2625388 theyve got some experienced men up front and some exciting youngsters coming through the new laws also suit them well theyre very dangerous on the counter attack

2625402 our study suggests that very high levels of omega 3 fatty acids have strong properties that may help prevent the buildup of cholesterol in the arteries
2625403 this prospective study provides new evidence that plasma concentrations of epa and dpa are associated with a lower incidence of nonfatal myocardial infract heart attack among us women
2625404 while we dont recommend americans change their diets to eat fish at these quantities because of concerns about mercury levels in some fish increasing intake of omega 3 fatty acids in the us could have a very substantial impact on heart disease

2625420 a news and media blog in the libertarian tenor with limited government overtones facilitating the flow of ideas information e commerce and inspiration within the democratic republics of the world
2625421 my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government
2625422 commerce with all nations alliance with none should be our motto
2625423 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
2625424 the happy union of these states is a wonder their constitution a miracle their example the hope of liberty throughout the world
2625425 the constitution is the guide which i never will abandon
2625426 a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and what no just government should refuse or rest on inference
2625427 for all those reasons and the fact that georgia has demonstrated that it is a close ally we cannot simply sit by and say so be it what does south ossetia mean to us
2625428 in other words kosovos declaration of independence claims that kosovo is a special case after the crisis in the 1990s and that it is not a precedent for this reason
2625429 we have strongly supported the ahtisaari plan implying kosovos independence we are heartened by the fact that the kosovo government has clearly proclaimed its willingness and its desire to support serbian rights in kosovo we also believe its in serbias interests to be aligned with europe and the serbian people can know that they have a friend in america
2625430 expect the un mission and nato led forces in kosovo to take immediate action to carry out their mandate including the annulling of the decisions of pristinas self governing organs and the taking of tough administrative measures against them

2625510 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2625511 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2625512 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2625513 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2625514 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2625515 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2625516 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2625517 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised

2625536 if john mccain wants to meet me anywhere anytime to have a debate about our respective polices that is a conversation i am happy to have
2625537 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist in plain english obama means i hope denying my obviously false and desperate allegation of racism will get me elected
2625538 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some white people to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work in plain english obama means why settle for a little cash i hope to ride white guilt to the white house and beyond
2625539 i decided i wont wear that pin on my chest instead im going to try to tell the american people what i believe will make this country great and hopefully that will be a testament to my patriotism
2625540 what is the relationship of the olympic games to human rights abuses
2625541 in how many instances did the chinese regime use the olympics as a pretext for human rights abuse
2625542 have earlier olympics in other lands led to human rights abuse and if so can past and present olympics be compared on quantitative measures of harm caused
2625543 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
2625544 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
2625545 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
2625546 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out

2625561 last year people were picking us to win the national championship game and we went 6 6
2625562 were playing a team that has garnered an awful lot of momentum the last two years
2625563 reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage
2625564 we were focused on the products that were going out for grinding
2625565 we were focusing on the product that we tied to the initial illnesses
2625566 madeleine came here for lunch with her parents not long before she disappeared
2625567 i dont know if this guy took a picture of madeleine its impossible to say but he took a lot of photographs on the beach
2625568 the police said they had had complaints about a man acting strangely on the beaches they thought he might have been a watcher a voyeur they told me to get in touch if i saw him again but i never saw him after that
2625569 they came a lot but i only saw the mccann family here once
2625570 i saw the little blemish in her right eye she really stood out she was the absolute image of the missing madeleine
2625571 i was afraid to do anything i decided to get a good look to make sure it was her so i could report it
2625572 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2625573 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2625574 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2625575 i shop here because the standards are higher so yes this really concerns me
2625576 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2625577 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2625578 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2625579 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2625580 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2625581 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2625582 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2625583 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2625584 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2625585 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2625586 one of the issues around looking at the impact of seizures is that were not quite sure what impact they have because the issue of stockpiling
2625587 we know with a range of other substances like heroin and amphetamines that theres a high level of stockpiling that goes on so when there is a seizure it doesnt necessarily translate to reduced access to the drug on the street
2625588 our sense is that yes this is a big seizure we need to watch it very carefully in terms of the impact but our past history would tell us that the impact at the street level will be minimal if anything
2625589 people would not be sending this quantity of product to australia without a realistic expectation that they stand to be able to move all of this product
2625590 so what youre looking at is a truly phenomenal demand in australia for these sorts of drugs in the modern era
2625591 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity
2625592 my mother always taught me say something good or say nothing at all
2625593 figment of the tabloid press i dont want that garbage in with the puppy story
2625594 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2625595 we go to church and serve the lord and try to lead good lives and do good things
2625596 we have no doubt that this copying has been willful and is intended to trade upon the fame and cachet of the lv trademarks to elevate the status of the infringing guitar strap and of janes addiction
2625597 you talk to them like youre their equal better yet you put them in your shoes
2625598 thats enough for tonight why dont you come back tomorrow
2625599 theyre happy tears because my friends just had a beautiful little baby boy
2625600 i make a conscious effort not to be conscious of it because im rania you know people call me queen but you know thats not me im rania
2625601 one of the major misconceptions about this position is that people think that i might be far removed that i might not be in touch with reality
2625602 the honest truth is that my life is very much about dealing with issues on the ground dealing with the problems that our country faces thats something i do on a daily basis
2625603 i am a mother i care about my children i worry about what they eat i worry about the influences from their friends
2625604 the most important thing is to instill them with the right values
2625605 i just feel that values are the shield that you carry with you throughout life it protects you from whatever life throws at you
2625606 once you feel that others are like you then you want for others what you want for yourself
2625607 you can change the course of a nation through education
2625608 one of the most important things you can do for a girl is empower her with her education once she has the education she can then have control over her income she can change her life she can have choices
2625609 unfortunately in the west people look at the veil as a sign of oppression or weakness this is not true as long as a woman is wearing it because of her belief i always say we should judge a woman according to whats going on in their heads rather than whats going on top of their heads
2625610 once you go beyond the mannerisms the language the cultural idiosyncrasies you realize that youre basically the same you know
2625611 i would like to dispel the misconception that arabs are all extremists that arab people are violent and that women in the arab world are oppressed and suppressed
2625612 the biggest nightmare for the extremists is for us to get along and thats why we have to get along we have to communicate more
2625613 we look at problems happening halfway across the world and we think well thats their problem but its not
2625614 when you solve somebody elses problem youre solving a problem for yourself because our world today is so interconnected
2625615 the idea of rolling out a chinese painting scroll in the center of the stadium gives very tranquil and vacant atmosphere with graceful kun opera and other ancient melodies it explains well the inner tranquility of chinese people
2625616 zhang yimou has artfully put the countrys 5000 year old history into a painting and it was really a masterpiece hes really ambitious and he did it
2625617 the firework footprints strolled all the way along the central line of the capital to the birds nest it was like i saw a historical giant striding
2625618 the fireworks blossomed right above my head i was so astonished and completely speechless
2625619 a huge number of people participated in the opening performances as a symbol of collective efforts rather than individuals it really comes from our populous country
2625620 well you certainly cant sleep through that and i didnt even need my glasses
2625621 alert me when other users add me to their contact lists
2625622 block this person from seeing when you are online and contacting you
2625623 only people on my allow list can see my status and send me messages
2625624 i dont think hes impacted a game like that before and for a dual brownlow medallist thats a big call
2625625 but i think when you kick eight goals in an afl game and you win by four points or whatever we won by i think its his best performance ive seen from him and hes had a lot very very good ones
2625626 it keeps us really alive i think if you lose today its a tough road home from here so hopefully it gives the guys some confidence
2625627 it looked like we were down and out but to fight back was pretty important in the context of the game and the season
2625628 when pav matthew pavlich was lined up from about 25 metres out you obviously think things are going to be hard from here and i must admit i didnt watch the kick and i was happy when we actually got a chance to kick it back in
2625629 but i think this team just keeps on working and working and working and its a credit to them
2625630 theyve been up for sort of six years and its really hard in this competition to continue what theyre doing
2625631 i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2625632 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2625633 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2625634 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway and im not sure politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2625635 i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2625636 believes he should stand alone when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him

2625648 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2625649 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2625650 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2625651 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2625652 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2625653 it all began 75 million years ago back then there was a galactic federation of planets which was ruled over by the evil lord xenu xenu thought his galaxy was overpopulated and so he rounded up countless aliens from all different planets and then had those aliens frozen the frozen alien bodies were loaded onto xenus galactic cruisers which looked like dc 8s except with rocket engines the cruisers then took the frozen alien bodies to our planet earth and dumped them into the volcanoes of hawaii the aliens were no longer frozen they were dead the souls of those aliens however lived on and all floated up towards the sky but the evil lord xenu had prepared for this xenu didnt want their souls to return and so he built giant soul catchers in the sky the souls were taken to a huge soul brain washing facility which xenu had also built on earth there the souls were forced to watch days of brainwashing material which tricked them into believing a false reality xenu then released the alien souls which roamed the earth aimlessly in a fog of confusion at the dawn of man the souls finally found bodies which they could grab onto they attached themselves to all mankind which still to this day causes all our fears our confusions and our problems
2625654 i do not believe that fish evolved into mammals i do not think that it is physically chemically possible
2625655 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2625656 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2625657 because unlike in the united states in the middle east it is the grooms side that pays for all the expenses of the
2625658 senator kennedy killed that girl the same as if he put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger
2625659 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia
2625660 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds
2625661 how did it come about that highly sensitive technical information was given to the chinese why did the president ignore the national security experts who counseled against this deal what damage has been done to our national security
2625662 lone ranger work has taken him dangerously close to the neighborhood of what we used to call treason
2625663 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media
2625664 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
2625665 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
2625666 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2625667 i thought someone had been killed or something bad happened definitely
2625668 he was inside the vehicle had heard the crane actually give way he managed to get out before the crane came down on top of his vehicle
2625669 i thought this person should go out an buy a lottery ticket because this is his lucky day i was really surprised he was able to get out
2625670 its really the familys out here the kids are out here everybodys out here you can see its all set up itll be here like this all night long until it gets dark
2625671 i just think its kind of low key and you got kids out here playing different games and its just kind of family oriented we have a lot of fun

2625674 its a skill and its a learned skill but its also a hobby and it can be something you get little kids small kids in its very family oriented you dont have to be superman to do this it doesnt require a lot of skill to catch a muskrat and thats where everybody starts
2625675 the document is a challenge to various sharia councils who dont believe in gender equality but the world has changed and islamic law has to be renegotiated
2625676 we dont say yes or no to israeli military operations israel is a sovereign country
2625677 we are in very close contact with the israelis and we talk about the diplomatic track that were on
2625678 theyve said that diplomacy can work here and i know theyre doing their part to talk to all of the countries with which they have good relations to explain why its important to have a tough edge to our diplomacy
2625679 were on a diplomatic course and thats the important thing
2625680 i dont know what the iranians would do without the revenue that they receive from selling oil and so the idea that they would somehow deprive the world of iranian oil exports would have to have a pretty devastating effect on iran itself
2625681 can military strikes destroy irans gas centrifuge program probably not
2625682 this analogy is grossly misleading it neglects the important differences between a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment program and a reactor based program and fails to account for the dispersed relatively advanced and hardened nature of irans gas centrifuge facilities
2625683 it also ignores the years iran has had to acquire centrifuge items abroad often illicitly allowing it to create reserve stocks of critical equipment and raw materials
2625684 in its first four days its had 1 8 million hits that shows that the community is very interested in the information it can provide
2625685 the liberal party wanders around saying its all a waste of time presumably they would abolish it presumably they believe in less information for consumers
2625686 but consumers recognise that in a competitive market the more information they can have the better and we agree and were determined to give them that information
2625687 we said before the election the biggest impact on grocery prices was international factors we said before the election the biggest henpeck on petrol prices was world oil prices and that continues to be the case
2625688 the now prime minister and now treasurer were asked can you guarantee to bring prices down they said before the election no but we will do whatever we can to put more competitive pressure in to the market
2625689 these children are transported in special vehicles to the daycare centres and food is given to them free highly qualified teachers give them tuition in the afternoon and all the facilities are provided to them
2625690 perhaps the most famous of these was the 1991 assassination of india s prime minister rajiv gandhi by thenmuli rajaratnam a tamil tiger
2625691 although women make up roughly 15 percent of the suicide bombers within the groups that employ females they were responsible for an overwhelming 65 percent of assassinations one in every five women who committed a suicide attack did so with the purpose of assassinating a specific individual compared with one in every 25 for the male attackers
2625692 paradoxically the strategic appeal of female attacks stems from the rules about womens behavior in the societies where these attacks take place given their second class citizenship in many of these countries women generate less suspicion and are better able to conceal explosives moreover since female attacks are considered especially shocking they are more likely to generate significant news media attention for both domestic and foreign audiences
2625693 i have spent the last few years surveying all known female suicide attacks throughout the world since 1981 incidents in afghanistan israel iraq india lebanon pakistan russia somalia sri lanka turkey and uzbekistan in order to determine these womens motives i compared the data with a database of all known suicide attacks over that period compiled by the chicago project on suicide terrorism this research led to a clear conclusion the main motives and circumstances that drive female suicide attackers are quite similar to those that drive men
2625694 to begin with there is simply no one demographic profile for female attackers from the unmarried communists who first adopted suicide terrorism to expel israeli troops from lebanon in the 1980s to the so called black widows of chechnya who commit suicide attacks after the combat deaths of their husbands to the longtime adherents of the liberation tigers of tamil eelam separatist movement in sri lanka the biographies of female suicide attackers reveal a wide variety of personal experiences and ideologies
2625695 blaming islamic fundamentalism is also wrongheaded more than 85 percent of female suicide terrorists since 1981 committed their attacks on behalf of secular organizations many grew up in christian and hindu families further islamist groups commonly discourage and only grudgingly accept female suicide attackers at the start of the second intifada in 2000 sheik ahmed yassin the founder of hamas claimed a woman martyr is problematic for muslim society a man who recruits a woman is breaking islamic law hamas actually rejected darin abu eisheh the second palestinian female attacker who carried out her 2002 bombing on behalf of the secular aqsa martyrs brigade
2625696 all secular organizations that employ suicide bombings have used female attackers early and often
2625697 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care

2625712 as the world celebrates the opening of the beijing olympics people should pause to remember the atrocities in burma 20 years ago
2625713 this anniversary is testament to the burmese peoples enduring demand for freedom and to the worlds failure to end repressive military rule and china more than any other country has enabled the survival of the brutal burmese regime
2625714 vote to nowhere the may 2008 constitutional referendum in burma
2625715 the chinese government and the olympic movement should be ashamed to have a leader from this ruthless regime as an olympic guest
2625716 at the very least beijing should tell the prime minister that its time for political reform in burma as a responsible power china should put the burmese peoples welfare first ahead of profit from business deals and arms sales that only benefit the regime
2625717 hello mr hermit maybe your hermitage was quiet until the moment you came here now you are here and you sound no more quiet right
2625718 wind is neither free nor captive and the wind always leaves a something behind and the wind always takes a something away
2625719 mr hertmit so you got wait until all is quiet then ask your question above
2625720 from thehermit wind comes and goes without feeling free or captive without taking or leaving nothing but it moves things
2625721 no offence but this reminds me of colonel flagg the army intelligence officer from the tv show mash who said he moved like the wind without anyone seeing him come or go and then he fell out the window and broke his leg while making his divine exit
2625722 mr hermit you mean that the d o m took the words from you and made them into those questions and now no more words left in you and you couldnt say anything you wanted to say is that what mean

2625741 i wouldnt be afraid or daunted by these big figures or the scale of what you see in china just hold faith with the great games that were going to host in london in just four years time
2625742 i dont think theres a lot of learning to be had from previous host cities because every host city is different
2625743 at this rate the arctic ocean could be nearly ice free at the end of summer by 2012 much faster than previous predictions
2625744 however for nearly the past 30 years the data pattern of its ice sheet melt has zigzagged a bad year like 2005 would be followed by a couple of lesser years according to that pattern 2007 shouldnt have been a major melt year but it was said konrad steffen of the university of colorado
2625745 552 billion tons of ice melted this summer from the greenland ice sheet its an amount of water that could cover washington d c a half mile deep researchers calculated
2625746 may have stolen sentences from at least six recent biology papers
2625747 dont be embarrassed by normal healthy positive images of people
2625748 what happens if some it comes into our real life
2625749 this should allow us for the first time to discover the mummy of nefertiti
2625750 some research in how the epidemy spread would be useful
2625751 with dickheads like this having influence over large gullible and powerless populations i sometimes wonder whether a bit of atheistic neo colonialsm wouldnt be of benefit
2625752 you are not alllowed to listen to certain beliefs because you might beleive them
2625753 even when los mycoplasma incognitus killed sickened every animal injected and is being found in many people with complex multi organ symptoms by pcr
2625754 everyone in the world should be exposed to the dissident argument and the mainstream arguments on hiv
2625755 according to harvey bialy he gave a lecture in south america to several scientists who were skeptical of his claims after the lecture the all changed their minds quickly
2625756 if things dont add up we as a society can demand independent studies investigations to get to the bottom of these complex issues
2625757 in 1984 robert gallo claimed hiv was the cause of aids bc the lack of a relaible animal model and a ever extending window period we are going to follow hiv positive people with no other possible risk factors such as drug abuse severe mental illness other infection like mfi azt and compare them to hiv negative matched controls to confirm or falsify gallos hypothesis
2625758 its going to be pretty tough culshaw is nobel prize material although im leaning toward the next potential galileo culshaw
2625759 you should see the film hiv fact or fraud as well you will hear culshaws father figure and mentor duesberg and his pals in their own words
2625760 then you should read project day lily to find out about the mycoplasma incognitus biowarfare prpgram uncovered by two renoun cancer reserachers a microbe that shyh ching lo from the army killed every animal inoculated
2625761 the nicolsons found it in the blood of gwi soldiers

2625765 i am continually astounded that our profession conducts itself devoid of any awareness of the history of science or medicine the nature of a scientific paradigm or the contexts that shape clinical research and clinical practice it seems that most in our field and the media covering our field act as if the clinical research process is an objective process that is not analyzable or appropriate to report on or to subject to criticism the dhhs panel that decides on treatment guidelines consists largely of people who have no clinical experience and amazingly like some medieval or modern ecclesiastical authority have lifetime appointments
2625766 you aint no son of mine for what youve done theyre gonna find a place for you and just you mind your manners when you go and when you go dont return to me my love

2625770 now we know proteins will affect a volume of water comparable to their own thats pretty amazing
2625771 water as we know it does not exist within our bodies
2625772 water in our bodies has different physical properties from ordinary bulk water because of the presence of proteins and other biomolecules proteins change the properties of water to perform particular tasks in different parts of our cells
2625773 water can be viewed as a designer fluid in living cells
2625774 the museum agreed to conceal evidence brought to light by jewish researchers who have rejected the essene theory and to physically exclude them from lecturing at the exhibit
2625775 links are to jewish forward editorial and oriental institute website article
2625776 so what i would like to know is does this exhibit tell the truth
2625777 saw themselves as the true israel and viewed those living in jerusalem including the priesthood at the temple as corrupt
2625778 take claims about dead sea scrolls with a grain of salt
2625779 jerusalem and the second temple were destroyed by titus and the people were again sent into exile marking the end of the second temple period
2625780 well have to do more with him because thats what our offense has to have
2625781 in the couple series he was going to get limited snaps i just didnt see a reason to do that in the first game remember its a long time until we play a game that counts
2625782 hell play more next week so hell throw more in general part of that is game plan part of that is how the flow of the game is going
2625783 it wasnt by design for him to have so few attempts but we knew he was not going to play very much
2625784 i thought we were getting in a groove i wanted to go but thats coachs decision
2625785 i dont know yet that we can all of a sudden be a pass heavy team and throw the ball all over the place
2625786 with a right tackle that was injured the last half of the year coming back a new left tackle and not very much line depth theres no part of me right now that could tell you we would be able to change right now from where we were last year
2625787 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2625788 i just spoke separately with secretary rice and president saakashvili about the grave crisis in georgia i told president saakashvili that i was deeply concerned about the well being of the people of georgia
2625789 over the last two days russia has escalated the crisis in georgia through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2625790 as i have said for many months aggressive diplomatic action must be taken to reach a political resolution to this crisis and to assure that georgias sovereignty is protected diplomats at the highest levels from the united states the
2625791 thats why john mccain will go hide at his ranch for a few days and be done with it poor obama he doesnt have a ranch
2625792 getting him in a swimming suit will be one of the big gets
2625793 one of the great mistakes campaigns make is that we just burn out the candidates
2625794 particularly after he won the nomination kerry needed to take some time that is when he made a couple of mistakes in public events that he would not have made if he had taken off a few weeks
2625795 we are going to correct that this week hopefully with your help
2625796 i want you to know that we arent here to politick
2625797 the main purpose of me being here right now before i head off and see my grandma is to say thank you to all of you because all of you worked so hard to put me in a position where i may have the honor of serving as your president of the united states
2625798 i remember any number of people at the time saying that should have gone to his wife teresas farm
2625799 there was a message that we thought would be conveyed by marthas vineyard that may not be positive
2625800 for somebody who has been called elitist going to hawaii is not exactly going against type

2625806 for the first time weve built a sequence from ancient dna that is essentially without error
2625807 likes attending fancy shindigs and events is still thinking about their best party idea ever
2625808 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2625809 our unomig military observers report ongoing military preparation by the abkhaz de facto authorities for a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2625810 this is a conflict that is expanding and getting out of control
2625811 the proximate cause is the massive escalation perpetrated by outside forces
2625812 the georgians have made an offer of a ceasefire and its concerning that the russians wont respond to that
2625813 its clear that the russians are looking to prolong the conflict in some way because they will give no assurances either about a cessation of hostilities or about withdrawing their forces
2625814 there is great dispute and controversy about the origins of this including prior mobilisation of russian troops on the other side of the georgian border
2625815 falls within the scope of their rights duties and powers
2625816 the united states and russia must take the lead in striving to abolish nuclear weapons
2625817 these two countries should begin implementing broad reductions of nuclear weapons instead of deepening their conflict over among others the introduction of a missile defence system in europe
2625818 i vow to lead the international community for permanent peace
2625819 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2625820 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it

2625839 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
2625840 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2625841 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2625842 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2625843 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2625844 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2625845 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2625846 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2625847 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2625848 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2625849 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2625850 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2625851 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2625852 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2625853 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2625854 i just spoke separately with secretary rice and president saakashvili about the grave crisis in georgia i told president saakashvili that i was deeply concerned about the well being of the people of georgia

2625857 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2625858 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2625859 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2625860 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2625861 of complications from pneumonia in a chicago area hospital his publicist danica smith said in a statement from los angeles
2625862 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2625863 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2625864 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see
2625865 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2625866 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2625867 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2625868 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2625869 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2625870 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2625871 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2625872 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2625873 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2625874 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2625875 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2625876 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity
2625877 my mother always taught me say something good or say nothing at all
2625878 figment of the tabloid press i dont want that garbage in with the puppy story
2625879 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2625880 we go to church and serve the lord and try to lead good lives and do good things
2625881 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2625882 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2625883 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2625884 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2625885 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2625886 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2625887 should talk to the american people and talk to the world
2625888 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
2625889 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2625890 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds
2625891 sou eu e voc n o precisa mais procurar s vio
2625892 we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists from this day forward any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the united states as a hostile regime

2625917 what disgusts the narrator about this character is that he she has a window into what she he could have been gail right seems to be consumed with lust and cares for little more than a sexual relationship its possible that the narrator could see how empty gails words are in this passage shes promising little more than temporary satisfaction followed by post orgasmic friendship this seems to be the same setup of the narrators previous relationships this event could have helped the narrator into seeing what he she had looked like before the romance with louise but also what he she could have been had lousie never came into the picture
2625918 one could say that a mannequin is an essential tool in a capitalist society not unlike the narrator from the novel material goods are a main source of identity to a great majority of people the mannequin could be seen as playing a large part in helping people with identifying themselves with the goods they are sold one could see a mannequin sitting in a brand new car euphorically gazing out with a blank stare and a content smile and may think that they may that a new car will make them as happy as the mannequin
2625919 we live in a time when nothing will ever go away again
2625920 postmodernism as a style and as a condition evolved from the terror of pure excess to the manipulation of available information
2625921 the initial technophobic responses of to the glut of information
2625922 the more contemporary response of mastering the array of information which now forms the fabric of day to day life
2625923 cyberpunk fiction at its best opened up the range of possibilities for imagining the effects of computer and media technology but at its weakest it offered a hard rock bad boy version of the same old scenario overloaded individuals struggling against the system conceived as a malevolent totality
2625924 opera seemed campy and therefore available to gay audiences only when it had become and outdated art form
2625925 gay culture has perfected the art of mimicking the diva to help the stigmatized self image it is received believed and adored
2625926 that rather than being eliminated by ever more sophisticated forms of distribution and access the production of
2625927 postmodernism has become a damn in a river of information
2625928 the postmodern as i have been defining it is not a degeneration into
2625929 all shall be well and all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well
2625930 justice and solidarity and to respect in whatever circumstance the value and dignity of every person who also has a right not to be wounded in what concerns his private life
2625931 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2625932 our unomig military observers report ongoing military preparation by the abkhaz de facto authorities for a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2625933 this is a conflict that is expanding and getting out of control
2625934 the proximate cause is the massive escalation perpetrated by outside forces
2625935 the georgians have made an offer of a ceasefire and its concerning that the russians wont respond to that
2625936 its clear that the russians are looking to prolong the conflict in some way because they will give no assurances either about a cessation of hostilities or about withdrawing their forces
2625937 there is great dispute and controversy about the origins of this including prior mobilisation of russian troops on the other side of the georgian border
2625938 i cannot remember the sound i made on the violin and i did not enjoy trying to play it but i liked to hold and carry it
2625939 as i came to understand music as social currency i realized i needed to declare an allegiance
2625940 punk had nothing to do with being a girl it neutralized rejected and released me i made myself strange becasue i felt strange and now i had something to belong to for which my isolation and oddness were credentials
2625941 for all the changing and saving of the world for all the not being a girl for all the black and white of it the rising above and stepping aside and for all that music had carried and shaped and shown this was the truth the carriage return
2625942 falls within the scope of their rights duties and powers
2625943 the zionist occupation has not yet agreed to the demand to release our prisoners so our fighters are preparing for the next round in
2625944 its a decent system easy to program for but to create something new and outside the box is just a daunting task
2625945 with the wii we have to think of something new and we cant just think of putting new rosters into our sports game which is a feature many people liked its something thats a bit different for us instead of putting out a new madden game with the same graphics controls and everything else we actually have to think to ourselves how to make a game that has some different elements
2625946 we know the wii cant handle xbox 360 graphics maybe not even ps3 type of graphics which run at 30 frames per second but we know that in time the wii will get a major upgrade it wont be called wii 2 but more along the types of wii advanced just something to show that the system is more graphics and processor heavy than its predecessor maybe wii hd is what it will be called
2625947 i know that during my 8 yrs in office there have been many disasters and a war

2625954 were going to come out here with undying canadian pride and honour were just going to throw it down
2625955 i knew these girls could do it we are all pumped up
2625956 it is hard not to be a deer in the headlights that very first race i was shaking a bit on the blocks i think its going to be even better in the final
2625957 even though there was no chinese in my race it was loud as ive ever heard
2625958 the environment seemed to just keep getting bigger and louder
2625959 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2625960 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2625961 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2625962 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2625963 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2625964 we recognize that the right to bear arms is an important part of the american tradition and we will preserve americans continued second amendment right to own and use firearms we believe that the right to own firearms is subject to reasonable regulation but we know that what works in chicago may not work in cheyenne we can work together to enact and enforce common sense laws and improvements like closing the gun show loophole improving our background check system and reinstating the assault weapons ban so that guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists or criminals acting responsibly and with respect for differing views on this issue we can both protect the constitutional right to bear arms and keep our communities and our children safe
2625965 were going to pass the most draconian laws we possibly can where our political machine is the strongest well round up the rest of the bitter clingy hicks rubes and rednecks later when we have an iron grip on power
2625966 regulating gun shows out of existence so that members of the community of people who own guns will be less likely to get together to oppose our socialist agenda
2625967 registration of all gun sales in the country in preparation for eventual confiscation of civilian firearms
2625968 banning every semi automatic firearm in the country with a magazine well
2625969 new d c gun regulations seem to flout supreme court decision
2625970 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2625971 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2625972 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2625973 i was trying to get in and he wouldnt let me in and he said whats your name francona
2625974 he said ive got a mr cona here so much respect around the league
2625975 the united states is already aware of the mistakes in their financial system they are taking a number of steps to restore confidence in their market us public consumption has also begun to recover
2625976 the strains of the more relaxed side of weekend with haunting vocals in the mould of nico
2625977 the everything but the girl marine girls vein of song
2625978 why oh why oh why is the structure of my chromosones
2625979 im not going to indicate what may or may not have been discussed at cabinet but our position is quite straightforward we dont support the use of capital punishment
2625980 when an australian overseas has been convicted and is subject to capital punishment as a sentence we make representations on behalf of australian citizens
2625981 when it comes to other individuals who arent australian citizens well make a judgment on a case by case basis as to whether its appropriate to make representations or to join in representations at a regional or multilateral level
2625982 but the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty
2625983 so i wont be making any individual representations so far as the bali bombers are concerned
2625984 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to the death penalty
2625985 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes
2625986 i dont want to get as i said last night prematurely stressed about it
2625987 im going to write this on the inside cover of my book and im gonna remember it when im dead
2625988 so ma how is it here are they treating you all right
2625989 a country with fewer than one percent of the eus 490 million population has destroyed a treaty painstakingly negotiated over years by leaders of all 27 member states
2625990 religious faith will be of the same significance to the 21st century as political ideology was to the 20th century
2625991 what happened inside the bush white house and washingtons culture of deception
2625992 the role of the american neo conservatives in the irish referendum was very important
2625993 have most american neo conservatives ever heard of the lisbon treaty and if they have do they care
2625994 i can guarantee that is the one thing i will not be asked about
2625995 the obstinacy of president sarkozy to have our fellow citizen freed was without any doubt the determining element
2625996 the church sat on it and suddenly decided to bring it to the public now why
2625997 johnson should apologise personally to all those who were assaulted and abused last night thanks to a half baked gimmick designed solely as a publicity stunt and without a moments thought for the people told to implement it we warned that it could put our members at greater risk of assault but there is no comfort in being proved right when tube workers have been injured and abused
2625998 the european idea will be in danger if we dont protect europeans
2625999 some people go through life with their deck chair facing forward gazing out where they are going
2626000 others go through life with their deck chair facing backwards looking at where theyve been
2626001 i really dont never been able to get my deck chair unfolded
2626002 im building a new dam so the water will divert over that way
2626003 why jackson dont you think mother nature can take care of the course of this stream herself
2626004 well it can be improved upon im sure somewhere down the road there
2626005 im a man see we can always fix things that dont seem like theyre broken see cause f you think about something long enough

2626012 h muito poucas mulheres que conseguem separar suas raivas e conflitos interiores e em geral transmitem s crian as os sentimentos de frustra o derivadas da rela o fracassada com o c njuge freq ente que as crian as se transformem em confidentes da m e e recebam todas as cr ticas que ela faz ao pai
2626013 as mam es devem ter claro que muito importante a presen a do pai na educa o e forma o dos filhos especialmente nos filhos homens
2626014 devem dar crian a a certeza de que ela tem um pai que pode estar longe no caso das m es solteiras ou separadas por m que em algum momento pode voltar ou que est no c u quando se trata de m es que ficaram vi vas por m que estar sempre presente em seu cora o
2626015 quando o menor dos filhos pequeno n o conv m entrar em detalhes porque n o est preparado para entend los a nica coisa que quer ter um pai e ter o direito de pensar que ele existe
2626016 dizer crian a por exemplo que seu pai vive em outro lugar porque com o passar dos anos pode aparecer novamente com efeito muitos pais aparecem quando as crian as j s o pr adolescentes ou quando j est o entrando na vida adulta
2626017 n o se trata de retratar o pai ausente como um super homem ou de dizer lhe que quando voltar vai lhe trazer presentes sen o que simplesmente existe e que tem que viver em outro lugar mas que apesar disso o quer muito
2626018 recomend vel por exemplo que a m e diga ao filho teu pai e eu nos separamos e por raz es de trabalho ele teve que ir se para longe por m quem sabe em algum momento te escrever
2626019 muitas vezes os pais querem participar mas as m es n o o deixam ou condicionam as visitas ao pagamento da pens o aliment cia no entanto e se o pai em algum momento n o puder pagar a m e vai expor a crian a ruptura com seu pai as duas coisas n o deveriam estar relacionadas porque assim se prejudica a estabilidade emocional das crian as
2626020 teu pai est passando por um mau momento tenhamos f e esperemos porque ele te ama e seguramente depois de algum tempo ir procurar te
2626021 em geral as crian as criadas com seus av s s o crian as muito seguras porque foram desde sua inf ncia tremendamente queridas e apoiadas a nica coisa que muitos av s querem estar pr ximo dos seus netos e isso algo que as m es que est o sozinhas e as fam lias em geral devem resgatar

2626028 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia

2626038 these are always case by case bases its always been hard for labor to win the northern territory just as in western australia my own state im expecting a tough and tight election in western australia im confident that well win
2626039 in the community so far as the federal government is concerned i continue to get good feedback from the public who indicate theyre pleased that weve been implementing our election promises and they believe that the government is doing a good job
2626040 the conservatives in the northern territory are coming off a very low base so in many respects the only way was up
2626041 i didnt detect many federal issues running through the northern territory campaign i think it is always very dangerous to try and extrapolate state results on to federal results or vice versa

2626065 makhzenisme2 te sieds si mal a toi et a hmida jai bon espoir de vous recuperer un jour
2626066 nevertheless each one should retain the place in life that the lord assigned to him and to which god has called him this it the rule i lay down in all the churches
2626067 but for the grace of god i am what i am and his grace to me was not without effect
2626068 i think you are already doing what youre supposed to be doing
2626069 therefore i urge you brothers in view of gods mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual act of worship do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind then you will be able to test and approve what gods will is his good pleasing and perfect will for by the grace given me i say to everyone of you do not think of yourself more highly than you ought but rather think of yourself with sober judgment in accordance with the measure of faith god has given you just as each of us has one body with many members and these members do not all have the same function so in christ we who are many form one body and each member belongs to all the others we have different gifts according to the grace given us if a mans gift is prophesying let him use it in proportion to his faith it it is serving let him serve if it is teaching let him teach if it is encouraging let him encourage if it is contributing to thto the needs of others let him give generously it it is leadership let him govern diligently it is showing mercy let him do it cheerfully
2626070 in six days the lord made the heavens and the earth the sea and all that is in them
2626071 when i consider your heavens the work of your fingers the moon and the stars which you have ordained
2626072 this is what god the lord says he who created the heavens and stretched them out
2626073 for by faith we know that the universe was formed at gods command so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible
2626074 for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created things visible and invisible
2626075 at your command all things came to be the vast expanse of interstellar space galaxies suns the planets in their courses and this fragile earth our island home
2626076 for a thousand years in your sight are like a day that has gone by
2626077 you probably wont believe me when i say this but metal really heavy metal death metal

2626079 for forty days the flood kept coming on the earth and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth the waters rose greatly on the earth and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed and the rain stopped falling from the sky the water receded steadily from the earth the tops of the mountains became visible
2626080 he turned the sea into dry land so that they went through the water on foot and there we rejoiced in him
2626081 at your command all things came to be the vast expanse of interstellar space galaxies suns the planets in their courses and this fragile earth our island home
2626082 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them
2626083 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul
2626084 let them praise the name of the lord for he commanded and they were created
2626085 havent you read he replied that at the beginning the creator made them male and female
2626086 for by faith we know that the universe was formed at gods command so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible
2626087 with the tongue we praise our lord and father and with it we curse men who have been made in gods image
2626088 a man ought not to cover his head since he is the image and glory of god
2626089 from the primal elements you brought forth the human race and blessed us with memory reason and skill you made us the rulers of creation but we turned against you and betrayed your trust and we turned against one another
2626090 fossil discoveries show that human beings and monkeys chimpanzees and other primates can trace their lineage to a common ancestor living seven million years ago we humans share almost identical dna and key protein molecules with chimpanzees we also are the most recent descendents of a line of hominid creatures now extinct the earliest fossils of our human like ancestors are about 6 7 million years old the first modern humans appeared 100 000 and 200 000 years ago
2626091 then god said let us make man in our image in our likeness
2626092 in this evolving universe god does not dictate the outcome of natures activities but allows the world to become what it is able to become in all of its diversity one could say that god has a purpose rather than a fixed plan as the 19 th century anglican minister charles kingsley put it god has made a world that is able to make itself polkinghorne states that god has given the world a free process just as god has given human beings a free choice
2626093 the only person that apart from dave scott ive met with a similar level understanding of mixing terrain skills and tactics
2626094 god created the heavens and spread forth the earth he gives breath to the people on it and spirit to those who walk on it
2626095 in the sight of god who gives life to everything
2626096 the spirit of god has made me the breath of the almighty gave me life
2626097 know the lord is god it is he who hath made us and we are his we are his people the sheep of his pasture
2626098 for you created my inmost being you knit me together in my mothers womb i praise you because i am fearfully and wonderfully made your works are wonderful i know that full well my frame was not hidden from you when i was made in the secret place when i was woven together in the depths of the earth your eyes saw my unformed body all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one them came to be
2626099 rich and poor have this in common the lord is the maker of them all
2626100 yet o lord you are our father we are the clay you are the potter we are all the work of your hand
2626101 give them a message for their masters and say tell this to your masters with my great power and outstretched arm i made the earth and its people and the animals that are on it and i give it to anyone i please
2626102 moreover we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it how much more should we submit to the father of our spirits and live
2626103 yet for us there is but one god the father from whom all thing came and for whom we live and there is but one lord jesus christ through whom all things came and through whom we live
2626104 a history of the world imperfectly kept and written in a changing dialect of this history we possess the last volume alone relating only to two or three countries of this volume only here and there a short chapter has been preserved and of each page only here and there a few lines
2626105 science cannot present a detailed step by step account of the origin of life from non living matter
2626106 once we see however that the probablilit of life originating at random is so utterly minuscule as to make it absurd it becomes sensible to think that the favorable properties of physics on which life depends are in every respect deliberate it is therefore almost inevitable that our own measure of intelligence must reflect higher intelligences even to the limit of god such a theory is so obvious that one wonders why it is not widely accepted as being self evident
2626107 theories are not mere guesses or hypotheses as people often suppose
2626108 and god blessed them adam and eve and god said to them be fruitful and multiply and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth
2626109 then god blessed noah and his sons saying to them
2626110 he took him abraham outside and said look up at the heavens and count the stars if indeed you can count them
2626111 i will confirm my covenant between me and you abraham and will greatly increase your numbers
2626112 and god said to him jacob israel i am god almighty be fruitful and increase in number
2626113 i myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where i have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture where they will be fruitful and increase in number
2626114 thus says the lord of hosts the god of israel to all the exiles whom i have sent into exile from jerusalem to babylon build houses and live in them plant gardens and eat what they produce take wives and have sons and daughters take wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage that they may bear sons and daughters multiply there and do not decrease
2626115 a large population is a kings glory but without subjects a prince is ruined
2626116 sons are a heritage from the lord children a reward from him like arrows in the hands of a warrior are sons both in ones youth blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them
2626117 yet the israelites will be like the sand on the seashore which cannot be measured or counted
2626118 from one man he made every nation of men that they should inhabit the whole earth and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live
2626119 you who were not as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but with few in number because you did not obey the lord your god just as it pleased the lord to make you prosper and increase in number so it will please him to ruin and destroy you
2626120 if you remain hostile toward me and refuse to listen to me i will multiply your afflictions seven times over as your sins deserve i will send wild animals against you and they will rob you of your children destroy your cattle and make you so few in number that your roads will be deserted
2626121 mario huam n no ha sabido leer los resultados del fracasado paro nacional y se empe a en seguir utilizando a la cgtp con fines pol ticos creo que se est n alejando de la defensa de los derechos de los trabajadores parar promover sus intereses pol ticos
2626122 todo esto revela que la dirigencia de la cgtp ha puesto en segundo o tercer plano la defensa de los derechos laborales para buscar hacerse de un espacio pol tico posiblemente pensando postular junto a ollanta humala en las elecciones del 2011
2626123 esa es la raz n por la varias bases nos est n tocando las puertas para ingresar a la ctp porque sienten que sus intereses no est n siendo defendidos por la cgtp este jueves por ejemplo vamos a movilizarnos al ministerio de trabajo para reclamar por el pliego de construcci n civil
2626124 tambi n m s de 400 millones de d lares en la ampliaci n y expansi n del sistema de transporte de gas natural que opera transportadora de gas del per tgp y 1 380 millones para aumentar la producci n de l quidos y gas de camisea a cargo de pluspetrol
2626125 entonces es imposible que un pa s duplique o triplique en 12 meses su infraestructura para abastecer de gas a las plantas el ctricas porque un ducto se construye en cuatro a os
2626126 tan pronto se tuvo un reporte t cnico que nos diera certeza de la seguridad se requiri al operador la ampliaci n del sistema que comenz el a o pasado y hoy est en marcha la ampliaci n de la planta de compresi n de chiquintirca y un ducto adicional de 107 kil metros
2626127 entonces el escenario ser a muy complicado por la mayor vulnerabilidad a la tiran a del precio alto del petr leo en el mercado internacional
2626128 ello permitir contar con m s gas natural para atender la mayor demanda de las empresas de generaci n y tener una situaci n m s holgada en el tiempo m s breve posible
2626129 and god blessed them adam and eve and god said to them be fruitful and multiply and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth
2626130 then god said i give you every seed bearing plant on the face of the earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it
2626131 then god blessed noah and his sons saying to them
2626132 the land is mine and you are but aliens and my tenants throughout the country that you hold as a possession you must provide for the redemption of the land
2626133 woe to the shepherds of israel who only take care of themselves should not the shepherds take care of the flock you eat the curds clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals but you did not take care of the flock you have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured you have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost you have ruled them harshly and brutally
2626134 0 shepherds hear the word of the lord this is what the sovereign lord says i am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock
2626135 as for you my flock is it not enough for you to feed on good pasture must you also trample the rest of your pasture with your feet is it not enough for you to drink clear water must you also muddy the rest with your feet
2626136 the earth dries up and withers the world languished and withers the exalted of the earth languish the earth lies under its inhabitants for they have transgressed the laws violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant therefore a curse consumes the earth its people must bear their guilt
2626137 i brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce but you came and defiled my land and you made my inheritance detestable
2626138 you have lived luxuriously on the earth and led a life of wanton pleasure you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter
2626139 and the worries of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word and it becomes unfruitful
2626140 the nations were angry and your wrath has come the time has come for rewarding your servants the prophets and your saints and those who reverence your name both small and great and for destroying those who destroy the earth
2626141 give us all a reverence for the earth as your own creation that we may use its resources rightly in the service of others and to your honor and glory
2626142 we pray for the just and proper use of your creation
2626143 we acclaim you holy lord glorious in power your mighty works reveal your wisdom and love you formed us in your own image giving the whole world into our care so that in obedience to you our creator we might rule and serve all your creatures
2626144 let us pray for an end to the waste and desecration of our earth gods creation for access to the fruits of creation to be shared equally among all people and for communities and nations to find sustenance in the fruits of the earth and the water god has given us in a way that cherishes these gifts
2626145 means that christians are commissioned to model for all humankind how to love and serve this earth the part of the creation upon which we dwell
2626146 genesis 1 26 28 states that human beings are created in gods image and likeness and given dominion over all other creatures dominion does not mean domination but the need for humans to exercise responsibility for the earth as gods representatives in genesis 2 human beings are given the garden to tend and serve symbolizing our obligation to care for creation
2626147 the god who is love unconditionally loves all of the creation and not merely us who are able to enter into a conscious relationship with god
2626148 science has taught us that all creatures including ourselves every species are genetically related and that all living beings are bound together in countless ecological communities of life therefore when we exercise stewardship we are caring for an earth in which god has made everything interdependent how we carry out this our primary vocation and ministry has great consequences for ourselves and for all of gods creatures on this good earth
2626149 we humans have fallen into sin and expressions of greed lust for power neglect and a willingness to turn a blind eye work against the mandate to be good stewards and keepers of gods good earth economic political and social structures and processes can also make this work difficult but contrition repentance confidence in gods forgiveness and the power of gods grace provide a pathway for carrying outs earth keeping as a labor of love

2626157 britain needs a bill of rights to protect the liberty of the individual
2626158 we recommend for inclusion amongst others the right to trial by jury the right to administrative justice and international human rights as yet not incorporated into uk law
2626159 we believe that there is a strong case for detailed rights for children and we recommend that the public should be consulted about including specific rights for other vulnerable groups
2626160 rights such as the right to adequate healthcare to education and to protection against the worst extremes of poverty touch the substance of peoples everyday lives
2626161 and it would help to correct the popular misconception that human rights are a charter for criminals and terrorists
2626162 we want to see a bill of rights that would set the bar for the universal standards to which everyone is entitled and fills the gaps in the protection of more vulnerable people such as the elderly children or people with learning disabilities

2626183 a tactical decision was made not to declare the fact that we had together seized and removed the possibility of 4 4 tonnes reaching the australian streets and that gave us the time and the space to analyse and to investigate what did occur here

2626187 this is another proof that the chinese communist regime is never going to be trusted they promised freedom for the press for the internet and they did the opposite nowadays with the olympics coming soon they actually intensified the crackdowns of the falun gong practitioners and the tibetan people and whoever they think they want to crack down they will do so so there is no freedom in china at all
2626188 yes this is another example its not the only one there are many companies american and european that have gone astray in china yahoo cisco who have collaborated in a way to the system of repression here its a french company eutelsat who is supposed to broadcast content in all the countries around the world in an independent way so by suspending ntdtv they are pleasing the chinese government in order to obtain more contracts so its an unfortunate choice and thats why we are fighting for this channel

2626192 gas prices at around 4 per gallon for a prolonged period could have a dampening effect on traffic and revenue and if declines are not offset by rate increases it could cause moodys to change our stable outlook
2626193 if we get higher fuel efficiencies in our vehicles that could have an impact

2626328 but i cant see anything but positive impacts to the area here if it were to happen to chicago even the notoriety the region would get would be beneficial

2626330 we dont know for sure theres the potential for that but theres no definitive plans
2626331 with 205 nations they all need training facilities to get acclimated to the weather and onu may be able to do that
2626332 they are used to having people use their facilities and they could acclimate a national team ahead of time they would certainly be a place to be considered

2626350 weve worked with a lot of students whove had health issues who havent had the means to get the necessary help so this clearly is a perfect way of supporting them

2626365 what ive said is that im playing the hand that was dealt and that my responsibility is to protect the u s economy and the american people
2626366 bart took something from andrew that he couldnt get back
2626367 he began to hate and he couldnt deal with the hatred and the betrayal it ate him up inside
2626368 it didnt happen often but when it did he didnt forget about it
2626369 bart mcinerney is a good man and would never do anything to harm or endanger another person
2626370 this town has been rocked everyones a little tender right now a little shaky were holding our breaths
2626371 of all the kids ive ever coached he was just very special young man
2626372 he had a natural enthusiasm you just cant teach and he was as dynamic off the field as on if you had 20 kids come up to you youd immediately notice andrew not just his smile but the way he interacted with people he was a bright multitalented energetic world is your oyster kind of kid
2626373 hed be the first kid in a crowd to come up and shake your hand and say hey mr martin how are you this was a kid who had everything together
2626374 we liked knowing where they were and we liked being with them
2626375 we enjoyed the laughter it just felt like one big happy family
2626376 before this went down no one would have ever suspected bart of anything never
2626377 i dont know a family who wouldnt have sent a kid to play for bart
2626378 he had the rosary beads and he would randomly pass them around
2626379 it was kind of annoying because youd have to say it out loud
2626380 i always thought of him as a good baseball coach who was really passionate about the game
2626381 we liked him we thought he was a great guy
2626382 i said okay angie boy i always called him angie boy tell me what you mean
2626383 you never knew when he was going to talk about it
2626384 one day he could come up and say something about the game and the next day he would talk about that
2626385 barts too big a figure and im going to look like a liar
2626386 he wasnt the regular outgoing always ready to do stuff type of kid that he had been it started to bother him more as time went by
2626387 he said he didnt want what happened to him to happen to other children to the younger kids coming in
2626388 it was so hard to believe that it didnt really hit me until the charges were filed
2626389 hed only do it to people he thought he could deal with people who were respectful of authority figures and trusting if he sensed you were like what the expletive are you talking about he wouldnt raise it again
2626390 he would want to know how many times you did it and how long it lasted whether or not you watched porn before whether or not you were using condoms
2626391 he would pull you off the side and say so you been getting em in
2626392 his body language was almost like he was enjoying the conversation
2626393 i still havent told my parents everything even though theyre your parents and theyre going to love you no matter what its still hard to say it
2626394 that conflict may continue long after the abuse goes away
2626395 he or she may feel scarred defective literally like someone missing a hand will feel defective
2626396 during the week hed be mostly fine school and sports took his mind off it
2626397 when it all came out a couple members of the st rose baseball team were really on him
2626398 one kid on the team said to andrew if i see you around im gonna beat you up it was andrews life getting messed up and this guy threatened him andrew got real upset about that
2626399 sometimes he would even joke about it but only with our close circle of friends because he knew we supported him it was different when other people did it
2626400 he wanted to prove to himself that girls still liked him and not just old men
2626401 he was looking for a long term girlfriend and if a girl said no to him it really got to him
2626402 he was loved by many but unfortunately he didnt love himself
2626403 he was capable but not confident and things got worse after a girl dropped him in december and then it got worse after bobbys death he knew bobby
2626404 he was hugging me and looked me straight in the eye and said well never let this happen again
2626405 that was one of the best moods id seen him in in a long time
2626406 he was so happy and looking forward to his senior year
2626407 he said that if he needed a ride hed call
2626408 bryan said something had happened at the tracks and andrew wasnt answering his phone
2626409 unfortunately and tragically somehow andrew came into contact with the train

2626440 it is a pity it took us so much time to score
2626441 in the first half we had many opportunities we displayed a lot of desire in the second half

2626457 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2626458 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo

2626528 im not going to indicate what may or may not have been discussed at cabinet but our position is quite straightforward we dont support the use of capital punishment
2626529 when an australian overseas has been convicted and is subject to capital punishment as a sentence we make representations on behalf of australian citizens
2626530 when it comes to other individuals who arent australian citizens well make a judgment on a case by case basis as to whether its appropriate to make representations or to join in representations at a regional or multilateral level
2626531 but the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty
2626532 so i wont be making any individual representations so far as the bali bombers are concerned
2626533 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to the death penalty
2626534 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes

2626540 para pengemis itu sering ke rumahmu sejak almarhum ibumu dulu tak pernah ditolak pasti dikasih kadang ibumu malah kasih buah buahan baju bekas dan kalau tak ada uang beri beras kalau tak ada sama sekali ibumu malah janji insya allah besok akhirnya ketika ibumu tiada mereka terbiasa lihat pengemis pengemis yang selalu datang kan yang sering mengemis semasa ibumu hidup mereka yakin pasti ibumu menyuruh melakukan hal sama kepada anaknya terhadap pengemis
2626541 ada pula yang kurang ajar waktu ibumu meninggal banyak pengemis yang datang bukan melayat tapi minta sedekah kepada para pelayat yang turut berdukacita
2626542 lihat pak piliek dia mengaku tak pernah memberi pengemis yang datang ke rumahnya sepeser pun dia merasa lebih tenang karena para pengemis tahu kalau ke rumah pak piliek dia tak mendapatkan apa apa maka mereka tak pernah datang lagi
2626543 namanya juga manusia biasa wajar ada ikhlas ada tidak ini bagian dari ujian memuliakan diri
2626544 kau tak ingin tangan yang biasa menadah lagi itu menghunuskan pisau dan menghunjamkan ke jantung kita yang merasa berkecukupan ini ia kelak bisa saja haus darah tak butuh uang atau beras dari kaum kaya atau kikir yang ketakutan karena tak seorang pun mau bersedekah
2626545 tuhan kadang aku bersedekah hanya karena takut mereka menjadi beringas oleh kemiskinannya yang panjang
2626546 jangan jangan ini kabar pertakut agar aku rajin bersedekah berbagi untuk apa yang dikatakan ibu baik untuk kehidupan
2626547 suamiku ingin sekali bersedekah ingin ada pengemis menghampirinya katanya setelah itu dia mati pun tak apa
2626548 itulah aku juga heran kalau sudah malam dia sering berkata ya silakan masuk makan dulu baru mengemis lagi ini sedikit uang untuk anak dan keluargamu hati hati di jalan ya mengemis itu halal kalau tak dikasih kerja oleh pemerintah tak dikasih modal oleh orang kaya mengemis halal lalu setelah itu dia tertawa
2626549 begini pengemis kan paling sering ke rumahmu ini kalau dia datang bawa dia ke rumahku biar suamiku tenteram
2626550 sungguh penemuan yang sangat luar biasa sekali dan sungguh sepektakuler awalnya saya curiga dan tidak percaya sama sekali dengan iklan yang ditawarkan bahkan saya sempat berfikir ah paling penipuan nih

2626576 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2626577 we won some games that we played well in and we won some games where we didnt do so well
2626578 we understand we could have played better we know that once we move the ball on offense and all play together then were an unbelievable team when we dont we become just as good as anyone else thats the most important thing we figured out
2626579 teams are not in awe of us as much as they were with the dream team
2626580 theyve seen us they know us they want to play us they feel they can beat us and thats ok we have to get it done
2626581 thats the point were trying to get across if we can run offense like were playing against ourselves thats much better
2626582 all these guys would rather play in big games theyre ready to play olympic basketball games for the u s
2626583 we won some games that we played well in and we won some games where we didnt do so well

2626587 thats the point were trying to get across if we can run offense like were playing against ourselves thats much better
2626588 all these guys would rather play in big games theyre ready to play olympic basketball games for the u s
2626589 these games are so hyped and theres so much pressure around it that it will fine tune our focus
2626590 weve been working so hard to be the best team but so has everyone else so well see
2626591 soms zie je mensen lopen en dan denk je sjonge god schept me toch mooie dingen
2626592 i am living on borrowed time i do not think i shall live through the next jump if i dont come back try not to take it too hard i wish i could persuade you to regard death as casually as we do over here in the head of battle you expect somebody to be killed and you are not surprised when a friend is machine gunned in the face you have to keep going its not like civilian life where sudden death is so unexpected
2626593 would you prefer somebody elses son to die in the mud you want us to win the war but apparently dont want to have your sons involved in the actual bloodshed thats a strange contradictory attitude somebody has to get in and kill the enemy somebody had to be in the infantry and the paratroopers if the country all had you attitude nobody would fight everybody would be in the quartermaster and what type of country would that be
2626594 i cannot understand why you hope for a quick end of the war unless we take the horror of the battle in to germany itself unless we fight in their villages blowing up their houses smashing open their wine cellars killing some of their livestock for food unless we litter their streets with the horribly rotten german corpses as was done in france the germans will prepare for war unmindful of its horrors defeat must be brought into germany itself before this can come to a proper end a quick victory now a sudden collapse will leave the countryside relatively intact and the people thirsty for revenge i want the war to end as quickly as anybody wishes but i dont want the nucleus of another war left whole
2626595 king boom boom giorno november 3 war memorial auditorium fort lauderdale youre the emcee black tie 8 o clock be there

2626599 excuse me miss weasley but i have something i need to talk to you about
2626600 do you really think that i could not step in and save a damsel in distress
2626601 i wasnt planning on coming but then word got around that the miss ginerva weasley one of the most eligible witches in london was going to make an appearance and i couldnt miss that for anything
2626602 but seriously i knew that you hated these things so i thought i would come to steal you away
2626603 does stealing me away include me having to put my shoe back on
2626604 how many times do i have to tell you to warn me before apperating with me
2626605 it was bloody fantastic how you caught the snitch right before they made what would have been their first goal
2626606 yeah well will see if thats the case next game
2626607 its bloody unbelievable is what it is how difficult is it to just tell me what you want and ill design something for you that you would like and you actually like it
2626608 youre a wizard arent you a wizard who gets hurt more than he should none the less
2626609 i guess i owe you big time for tonight right
2626610 mr weasley i would like to ask ginny to marry me
2626611 i believe so sir if not i might be finding out soon enough
2626612 i couldnt help myself sir i just knew she was the one for me
2626613 serves you right for joking at a time like this
2626614 will you ginny weasley love of my life my own damsel in distress my darling red marry me the man who loves you your knight in shining armor your
2626615 it felt great for us as a team to move the ball that way
2626616 we continued to keep fighting and we persevered through all of those penalties and i think that it shows the character and focus of this team
2626617 we had a couple of missed formations a couple of forced passes a couple of inaccurate throws but thats going to happen in a preseason game thats why were playing these games we want to work those kinks out
2626618 there are a lot of guys here today and i want to thank them for coming
2626619 i want to thank the giants for inviting all these great guys
2626620 its weird for me not to be in uniform with the dodgers right there you heard me torre i beat you before and i can beat you again i havent retired thank you
2626621 i know the players and coaches enjoy seeing those guys again
2626622 these players watched them and respected them it gives the guys a chance to go through memories about great times in san francisco
2626623 we just have to get used to game speed game tackling and just get honed in
2626624 i think we did a pretty good job everybody was hustling we have a couple of big hits out there but all around we are just trying to get a feel for the game again
2626625 he threw the ball away which is one of those situations that we talked about
2626626 he made a couple nice throws there on some back shoulder throws
2626627 i think we did well we moved the ball well
2626628 we were slow a little early they did some good things on defense we got it going after a series or two we had a couple good drives but we just have to finish
2626629 weve got to do a little better job of getting the defense off the field right now
2626630 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2626631 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2626632 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2626633 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2626634 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2626635 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

2626643 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2626644 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2626645 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2626646 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2626647 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2626648 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2626649 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2626650 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2626651 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2626652 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2626653 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2626654 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2626655 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2626656 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2626657 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2626658 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2626659 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2626660 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2626661 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2626662 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2626663 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2626664 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2626665 who are open to doing something on the production side
2626666 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2626667 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2626668 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2626669 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2626670 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2626671 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2626672 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2626673 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2626674 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2626675 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2626676 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

2626681 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2626682 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

2626685 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2626686 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2626687 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2626688 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2626689 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2626690 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2626691 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2626692 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2626693 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2626694 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2626695 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2626696 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2626697 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2626698 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2626699 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2626700 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2626701 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2626702 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2626703 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2626704 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2626705 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

2626710 school performance should not be seen simply as a proxy for intelligence
2626711 doing badly at school is not a cause of schizophrenia but it is a marker for something not being quite right several years prior to diagnosis
2626712 this isnt going to be a way of identifying people at school who are at risk of developing schizophrenia
2626713 but it could be useful when considering someone who is displaying other potential symptoms of impending psychosis
2626714 it is important to recognise that mental illnesses like schizophrenia are not linked to low intelligence the opposite is often true
2626715 there are lots of reasons why young people perform poorly in exams
2626716 problems with concentration and mental distress can interfere with studying and these can also be early signs of mental illness symptoms that commonly begin in late teens
2626717 the people in the study might have had normal intelligence but started having low level symptoms that disrupted their schooling
2626718 i was diagnosed when i was 13 with photosensitive epilepsy sensitivity to light after having three seizures
2626719 it is triggered by flickering lights tv screens computers etc
2626720 it is like i am having a bit like a day dream but you come back really quickly
2626721 when you come back it is like somebody has switched the light back on i can be talking to somebody and all of a sudden they can be saying something different and i havent got a clue what they have been saying i can be very confused
2626722 i have had near misses crossing roads and i burnt myself ironing at home once so i dont iron any more
2626723 when i was younger someone had to sit with me when i was in the bath now i am older i take a shower
2626724 i dont cook alone there needs to be someone there
2626725 the websites and leaflets i had growing up were very negative about it i found there are ways of doing things not everything was restricted
2626726 i was told i could never swim or travel alone i was told i could never do anything alone
2626727 i do not get a lot of time alone most of my time is spent with people but i have taken up surfing and can do this provided there are people around
2626728 of course there are things that you cant do but there are things you can
2626729 it gives voice to young people with epilepsy and presents their real experiences learning from others in a similar situation can bring so much hope and encouragement and above all young people with epilepsy can see that they are not alone
2626730 there is a lot of information out there but young people find it difficult to find the information about their particular type of epilepsy there is such a range they found it difficult to see what applied to them
2626731 there was also a lack of awareness in the ways it could affect their lives
2626732 epilepsy is a much misunderstood condition which is still often highly stigmatised a diagnosis can have a dramatic impact on every aspect of a persons life
2626733 this site allows young people who are sometimes quite isolated by the condition to gain an insight into how other young people with epilepsy are feeling and how they are dealing with situations in their lives
2626734 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
2626735 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2626736 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2626737 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2626738 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2626739 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2626740 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2626741 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2626742 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2626743 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2626744 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men
2626745 if anyone asks a man that he will slap you
2626746 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2626747 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2626748 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2626749 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2626750 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2626751 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2626752 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2626753 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2626754 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2626755 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2626756 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2626757 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2626758 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2626759 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2626760 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2626761 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2626762 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2626763 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2626764 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2626765 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2626766 this collection is for girls who like to be free and do whatever they like if its having a party going to school or being active the fact thats it has been inspirired by the chicama wave palmtrees tropical flowers and sunrises makes it a fresh and colourfull collection
2626767 it took years for blogging to reach the level of awareness that podcasting already has
2626768 i spent 35 years getting to know real estate in many metropolitan areas
2626769 and i pride myself to have all the information at hand when it comes to evaluating a deal i think information is very very important in ones decision process so i have another 32 years to try to catch up in the football business
2626770 but having the experience in real estate i hope it doesnt take that long
2626771 im not considering moving the team im not considering selling it so i think that question at this time is
2626772 were working very hard to bring forward a plan that hopefully we and the legislators can work on and move it forward as was promised to us when the twins and the gophers resolved their issues
2626773 as i have said many times as time goes on and with the cost of materials going up the way they do the task becomes more daunting
2626774 we feel that the location of the metrodome is really the gateway to downtown minneapolis
2626775 these guys are trying to invest in an economic development package
2626776 but hes trying to kind of sweeten the pot a little bit or at least make it easier for state leaders to participate in a difficult project by saying im going to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the economy and create jobs and economic development in a time that couldnt be better to do it
2626777 i found wilf to be straightforward and friendly and obviously a very savvy businessperson
2626778 i think the vikings are a pretty important community asset but there is not any proposal before anybody the issue will have to be discussed by minnesotans and well have to decide how to proceed
2626779 its not easy but were trying to do what we can for the short term for the next year or two
2626780 our lease is up in 2011 we want at least to have whatever revenue enhancements we can
2626781 and we set our goals very high we expect to win the division
2626782 we pride ourselves to be more developers than real estate investors
2626783 were a family that whatever we build on we hold on so were long term players
2626784 my dad and my uncle knew nothing really about the business of football they loved to watch the game
2626785 he tries to watch but usually its my mother who watches and she relays the results to my father
2626786 i think as we get better the nervousness will wear off
2626787 this is similar to other businesses in the sense that its still all about having the right people and the right character and right personalities
2626788 but its different in that sports and the vikings in particular so many people care about it so many people are passionate about it
2626789 ive been very fortunate to work with a bunch of very good owners
2626790 i think the wilfs are unique because and all owners have passion to win and things but i think the wilfs take it a step further just as far as having a total family atmosphere and applying that how they run their own businesses how close knit their families are how close mark and zygi and lenny are applying those same principles to here
2626791 i feel like a fan first and as a fan i want to have a chance to win a championship
2626792 thats the fan in me who wants to win and wouldnt mind the owner spending the money to get us that championship so i speak as a fan and as an owner that our primary goal is to win championships
2626793 at first when we came in as ownership it was a very exciting time
2626794 following our passion for football and being involved in such a storied franchise it was more like a kid enjoying his fantasy being involved meeting the players but like anything else it wore off not the fact the passion wore off but the fact that realizing the responsibility is much greater than what it seemed at first
2626795 our philosophy is that were very blessed in our business
2626796 we want to make sure that we give back and the vikings have a great tradition of that so were really just building on a tradition that was there already
2626797 dream come true to be involved in ownership in the nfl
2626798 there was obviously a concern that had she not followed the protocol we may have used deadly force

2626801 the conscious use of metaphor and metaphorical strategies will make your writing more colorful more intense more illuminating
2626802 i just feel like a weight is off my shoulders just a huge relief
2626803 weve come close we havent been able to close the deal ive had to be patient
2626804 of course im happy for these changes though a part of me worries whether anyone will preserve these centuries old crafts
2626805 former commonality our culture is no longer quite so sure it needs
2626806 i stared at his hand and something went out of me i could feel it a sucking force tidal pulling me out of myself my eyes were dry my vision clear the clarity of the moment its sharp focus

2626834 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2626835 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2626836 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2626837 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2626838 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2626839 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2626840 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2626841 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2626845 the president used to receive regular reports on the political situation in the country from the isi and the mi these reports in sealed envelopes marked eyes only were usually handed over to the president by the c in c on a few occasions the president gave me these reports and it seemed to me that the agencies were keeping the politicians particularly the east pakistanis under close surveillance i rarely found anything insightful in these reports the dib had direct access to the president and his weekly reports used to be fairly exhaustive it was during the presidential election in l964 that the isi and the mi became extremely active emphasis added
2626846 bin laden is safe and no damage has been done to any of his companions
2626847 director general of pakistans inter services intelligence isi lt gen mahmud ahmed has been replaced after the fbi investigators established credible links between him and umar sheikh one of the three militants released in exchange for passengers of the hijacked indian airlines plane in 1999 the fbi team which had sought adequate inputs about various terrorists including sheikh from the intelligence agencies was working on the linkages between sheikh and former isi chief gen mahmud which are believed to have been substantiated reports pti website informed sources said there were enough indications with the us intelligence agencies that it was at gen mahmuds instruction that sheikh had transferred 100 000 us dollars into the account of mohammed atta one of the lead terrorists in strikes at the world trade centre on sept 11 it adds
2626848 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2626849 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2626850 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2626851 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2626852 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2626853 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2626854 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2626855 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2626856 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2626857 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2626858 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2626859 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2626860 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2626861 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2626862 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2626863 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2626864 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2626865 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2626866 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2626867 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2626868 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

2626875 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2626876 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2626877 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2626878 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2626879 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2626880 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2626881 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2626882 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2626883 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2626920 inasmuch as the conversion of the indians to christianity was stated to bee the principal aim of the spanish conquerors they have dissimulated the fact that only with blood and fire have the indians been brought to embrace the faith and to swear obedience to the king of castile or by threats of being slain or taken into captivity
2626921 the christians have an ultimate aim which is to acquire gold and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time

2626923 their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the christians have an intimate aim which is to acquire gold
2626924 ravening beasts killing terrorizing afflicting torturing and destroying the native peoples
2626925 they said if he had been a little bit taller she would have got him in the head
2626926 we must first experience the bitterness of lifes bitter to taste the sweetness of lifes sweet
2626927 this really was a great rescue by firefighters who did what they are trained to do
2626928 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2626929 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2626930 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2626931 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2626932 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2626933 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2626934 every day that the centrifuges continue to spin brings iran closer to a nuclear weapons capability and threatens the stability and security of the region and the world
2626935 provoke us or attack us our army is prepared to attack and to succeed uncompromisingly
2626936 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2626937 our unomig military observers report ongoing military preparation by the abkhaz de facto authorities for a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2626938 this is a conflict that is expanding and getting out of control
2626939 the proximate cause is the massive escalation perpetrated by outside forces
2626940 the georgians have made an offer of a ceasefire and its concerning that the russians wont respond to that
2626941 its clear that the russians are looking to prolong the conflict in some way because they will give no assurances either about a cessation of hostilities or about withdrawing their forces
2626942 there is great dispute and controversy about the origins of this including prior mobilisation of russian troops on the other side of the georgian border
2626943 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia

2626945 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
2626946 located in p tion ville haiti sopudep school is a comprehensive public school serving the poorest residents of the city founded in 2002 the school has grown to over 400 students many of who receive their only regular meal through the schools hot lunch program
2626947 to post signs for her new project in the building and hold a press conference
2626948 sopudep school and the staff are a shining light for the children of haiti with nothing more than their own determination they have built a school that provides an unbelievable service to children that would otherwise have no means of obtaining any kind of education
2626949 it greatly disturbs me that such a success story in haiti should be under attack i have never met people more committed to doing what is right for the children of the community than the staff at sopudep school
2626950 the economic reality of haiti is such that a large proportion of children are inadequately nourished and unable to concentrate while in school i have seen the glazed look of hungry children in haitis schools sopudep has responded to this reality by instituting a feeding program guaranteeing hundreds of children one square meal every day of the week so they can focus on their studies
2626951 by threatening a closing of sopudep school the mayor of p tion ville is clearly showing a complete lack of concern for the health and future of her communitys most vulnerable members
2626952 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
2626953 this is me please like me but if you dont i bleed like the rest
2626954 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
2626955 if adopted in the final constitution by the people ecuador would become the first country in the world to codify a new system of environmental protection based on rights
2626956 i would have lost heart unless i had believed that i would see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living
2626957 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed its the only thing that ever has

2626960 im in like three months where i havent been able to pay my mortgage payment due to that i was laid off in february
2626961 i dont want to see a new generation of homeless people of homeless families because if they lose their home whats going to happen to them so thats what the government should do be pro active
2626962 it helps to have help because a lot of us dont know that there is help for us
2626963 a home is not just a house its a home
2626964 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia

2626975 in madrid now after a bit of frantic bike packing at the zaragosa estacion del tren got the sweet hook up and jonas put us on the tgv and it was an hour and a half to madrid it would have been 4 on the bus and because we rode so well this week a nice hotel
2626976 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2626977 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2626978 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2626979 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2626980 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2626981 you arent going to see dad in the next few days or so because i left my flat iron in the guest bath you couldnt ask him to send it to me could you
2626982 oh says the hmoth that will be air coming in from where the shower is leaking thus creating a vacuum
2626983 ive been running this race since i was 13 years old
2626984 third was my best coming into today and to win it is a dream come true for me
2626985 its the biggest race in australia and to be the first over the line is amazing
2626986 im really excited to win it was my second time running it competitively
2626987 i wanted to run the first 10km hard i didnt want to leave it until the final 4km because its pretty easy from there
2626988 us claims that the military surge is bringing stability to iraq
2626989 i turned around and the guy sitting right behind me was standing up and stabbing another guy with a big rambo knife right in the throat repeatedly
2626990 i got sick after i saw the head thing some people were puking some people were crying some people were shocked the attacker just looked at us and dropped the head on the ground totally calm
2626991 i think he would occasionally feel frustrated with not being able to communicate or understand
2626992 but we have a very patient staff and he seemed to respond well
2626993 there has to have been some particular trigger that led to this kind of an outburst when youve got a perpetrator and a victim who are absolute strangers to each other clearly its not personal because theres no history
2626994 we all like to have control over whats going on in our environment and the difficulty is we dont know who the person is that is sitting next to us
2626995 what leads to people being concerned about it is so what am i supposed to do
2626996 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
2626997 the ad will do nothing to advance the cause of peta except turn people away
2626998 so what got you to do a video about a mouse trap then its a pretty random idea isnt it
2626999 i think the puppet on the right shares my beliefs i think the puppet on the left is more to my liking hey wait a minute theres one guy holding up both puppets

2627009 el bar a no puede encajar dos goles por partido
2627010 siendo un equipo como el barcelona no puedes encajar dos goles por partido de todas formas estamos apurando la pretemporada para rectificar errores
2627011 estamos trabajando mucho el sistema defensivo pep nos insiste en estar muy juntos que nos ayudemos y hagamos m s coberturas en definitiva quiere que estemos m s agrupados y cerrados para evitar que nos hagan pases interiores
2627012 estamos trabajando a un ritmo muy alto y los jugadores ya no acabamos tan cansados como en los primeros d as las sensaciones son buenas el equipo est a un gran nivel juega bien presiona muy arriba y es capaz de agobiar al rival y obligarle a perder el bal n muy temprano
2627013 el tiempo se ha acabado y ahora llega la primera final todav a no hemos trabajado espec ficamente el encuentro no conocemos al rival pero tenemos tiempo por delante para perfeccionar todos estos detalles
2627014 la gente no debe confiarse del wisla est claro que partimos como favoritos que hemos rayado a un gran nivel en los amistosos pero cuanta m s gente vaya al campo mucho mejor puede ser una buena ocasi n para que la gente se enganche al equipo
2627015 je rijdt bij jou de straat uit gaat bij de eerstvolgende straat linksaf de brug over tot de rotonde die neem je driekwart en vervolgens neem je de 2e straat aan je linkerhand
2627016 nuestros atletas van a seguir participando en las pruebas a n con m s pasi n a n con m s determinaci n para el honor de nuestro pa s pero haremos gala de esta pasi n con todos nuestros adversarios incluida rusia no tendremos ninguna reacci n agresiva
2627017 no pod amos dejar pasar esta ocasi n nos comenta el tesorero de la pe a soriana gerardo fern ndez arias porque que el numancia est en primera divisi n es casi casi un milagro el hecho de que este partido sea en la primera jornada nos ha complicado un poco las cosas pero pese al poco tiempo que tenemos por delante vamos a hacer algo grande queremos mostrar la hospitalidad de soria tambi n el entusiasmo y la grandeza de los barcelonistas de nuestra tierra
2627018 somos conscientes de que lo estamos haciendo bien y de que lo hemos hecho bien durante la preparaci n pero tenemos que hacerlo bien de ahora en adelante y a n as est la dificultad de los rivales explica el seleccionador que ni siquiera se plantea los cuartos de final
2627019 hay que ir partido a partido y como mucho pensar en estar lo m s arriba posible en el grupo porque esto es muy largo y hay tiempo para todo
2627020 lo estoy viviendo como lo tiene que vivir un entrenador ocupado en su equipo y en los rivales con la m xima ilusi n y sabiendo que tenemos detr s a toda espa a y que el momento del baloncesto espa ol es bueno pero hay que refrendarlo con hechos no con palabras
2627021 este equipo tiene calidad el momento del baloncesto espa ol es muy bueno y vamos a intentar aprovechar esta calidad para poder seguir diciendo lo mismo despu s de los juegos porque sabemos que las cosas hay que demostrarlas haci ndolas no habl ndolas pero es verdad que hemos llegado al nivel que quer amos
2627022 los partidos ol mpicos no van a tener nada que ver con los de preparaci n hemos ganado todos los partidos pero los hemos jugado en espa a los otros equipos han tenido que viajar y nosotros est bamos all c modamente y con el p blico sin parar de apoyarnos siempre aqu las cosas van a ser sensiblemente distintas
2627023 estados unidos parece que est en un gran estado de forma por los resultados que han tenido y no cabe duda de que sus jugadores son inmejorables china juega en casa y tendr mucho apoyo angola siempre es un rival inc modo porque corre y salta mucho y alemania tiene a dirk nowitzki y parece que ha mejorado el equipo todos son rivales serios que seguro nos lo van a poner muy dif cil
2627024 hoy todo depende del jugador porque nosotros estamos abiertos a que se quede
2627025 no quer an a dos espa oles en la final de suelo me siento decepcionado porque he hecho un suelo bastante bueno y me merec a m s nota

2627029 s lo mi entrenador bob bowman y yo conocemos mis metas y lo que esperamos conseguir
2627030 creo que el mayor obst culo que michael tiene proviene de sus propios compatriotas tiene que superarlos primero
2627031 espero que mi oro abra el fuego de m s medallas
2627032 siempre he dicho que estoy muy a gusto en el chelsea un gran equipo con grandes jugadores y un gran entrenador todo va bien aqu y me quedan dos a os de contrato en los que jugar en el chelsea
2627033 sabemos que cada partido va a ser dificil simo por lo que no podemos ir confiados nunca
2627034 se va hacer complicado porque es un equipo que se van a encerrar atr s pero a diferencia del dia de costa de marfil en el que jugamos algo nerviosos saltaremos al campo m s tranquilos
2627035 no somos un dream team lo seremos cuando lleguemos a la final
2627036 well lindsay thats a noble thing to pray for but i have a better idea cmon lets go for a ride

2627045 son algo especial como vencer en wimbledon ganar el oro aqu ser a algo muy similar
2627046 porque este pueblo tiene un mont n de cosas que ense ar
2627047 las autoridades chinas nos han querido facilitar las cosas nos basta con cruzar la calle para llegar a la piscina adem s as no nos distraemos la villa es una fiesta mayor y lo s por experiencia en cambio en el hotel hacemos vida monacal
2627048 es un jugador que ha marcado muchos goles y que est claro que tiene nivel para estar en el barcelona ya ha demostrado que tiene cualidades para ayudar a ganar t tulos para m es un compa ero m s y ahora debe ser la secretar a t cnica quien decida lo que es mejor para el equipo
2627049 es un gran jugador he jugado con l en categor as inferiores y puedo decir que tiene una zurda de oro la banda izquierda del valencia es suya
2627050 ya dije en su d a que ve a complicado que se fuera
2627051 va a ser mucho m s dif cil al tener que jugar contra l
2627052 no ser ninguna revancha porque ahora hay muchos jugadores que no estuvieron entonces por lo que las circunstancias son diferentes
2627053 siempre es lindo poder ganar una final y mucho m s si lo haces contra la selecci n brasile a
2627054 ellos no son intocables son tocables cu ndo cuando hacen las cosas mal cuando son maleducados cuando no te tratan bien o cuando no son deportivos las patadas que te pega el real madrid en su campo no hacen da o y las que les dan a ellos son una verg enza entonces salen los mediocres de turno que quieren que el presidente les imponga la insignia de oro del real madrid que vale siete pesetas
2627055 era un jugador muy c modo que s lo jugaba en casa cuando hab a que rascar fuera se escond a porque era muy medroso

2627060 jugar en wembley levanta a todo el mundo el united est sin algunos jugadores pero va a ser muy dif cil ganarles

2627066 weapons are to be exclusively in the hands of one group the resistance group
2627067 im not going to indicate what may or may not have been discussed at cabinet but our position is quite straightforward we dont support the use of capital punishment
2627068 when an australian overseas has been convicted and is subject to capital punishment as a sentence we make representations on behalf of australian citizens
2627069 when it comes to other individuals who arent australian citizens well make a judgment on a case by case basis as to whether its appropriate to make representations or to join in representations at a regional or multilateral level
2627070 but the prime minister and i have both made clear that we dont propose to make representations on behalf of terrorists who have been subject to the death penalty
2627071 so i wont be making any individual representations so far as the bali bombers are concerned
2627072 ill be just making the point in our formal bilateral conversation in jakarta tomorrow that we have three of the bali nine still subject to the death penalty
2627073 ill make inquiries about the progress of their cases through the indonesian legal and judicial system and again make the point that when those processes have completed that if any of those three still remain the subject of the death penalty well be making a plea for clemency in accordance with our normal processes

2627083 the fact that deputy tollison took his closed fist and struck the suspect in the face 13 times in my opinion was excessive
2627084 would i still be making those mistakes i did in my life if id had the chance of watching such a series like this one as i was younger
2627085 i did say i was really disappointed in the movie i started the thread while watching it just was not what i expected but see i think that henry was good in the way i can hate him where as on the tudors i just cant hate mr jrm wink
2627086 well said sempereadem i actually enjoyed the boleyn inheritance waaaay more than the other boleyn girl tobg is more popular obviously but in my opinion the boleyn inheritance is much better written more entertaining and really funny in some places and dare i say it better researched
2627087 having lived in both french speaking luxembourg and england where i was born i think you will find that any language has many regional accents so to say someone has a flawless accent depends on your point of view and what region you are from in england you can drive a few miles and find a very different regional accent when i lived in luxembourg at first i couldnt discern a regional accent but after a while i could tell the difference between a parisian french a luxembourgish french and a canadian french i am sure a frenchman could discern many more regional differences to an accent so with regards to elizabeth who learned french from a tutor as opposed to mary who probably picked up her accent from actually living in france and hearing many regional accents there had to have been a difference in their accent i was born in england and grew up in africa till the age of 21 i still have an english accent despite living here in canada for many years my accent is mostly due to the influence of my parents but it has become a hybrid of all the places i have lived i tend to think marys must have also been the same some hybrid of french amp scottish

2627089 it has nothing to do with piracy concerns it has to do with different business terms expectations in that sector and more importantly generally prevailing pricing of pc digital games versus their console counterparts the typical downloadable price for digital only games on pc is actually 19 99
2627090 another consideration is that our distribution costs as a percentage are on average slightly higher on pc than console
2627091 in several cases we have another party beyond just the distribution portals taking an extra bite driving down our share of the revenue for example affiliate sites of our portal partners take a well earned slice of revenue for every sale then the portal gets its cut then we get ours three mouths to feed

2627119 99 percent of the farmers and ranchers want to get rid of the spurge because when they get rid of the spurge they got more grass and things for their livestock they got better production in the fields and i think most of them want to do it and biocontrol is the best agent they have because the chemical works but it takes a lot of extra labor and it is expensive

2627125 i too am disappointed sheppard only gets one episode right at the end of the season and is rarely mentioned in spoilers and so are many sheppard fans i know
2627126 now ive not held a focus group or conducted a poll to assess her liking amongst the fandom and im sure theres a fair few that like her but equally it seems that there is a fair few that dislike her something ive never seen before in a fandom although ti could be argued that this is the only fandom i play in
2627127 joe the writing staff seems a very collaborative bunch however how much contibuting to a script gets a writing credit and how much is helping out the team
2627128 i heartily dislike keller i really cant get past the dithering and the constant whiny voice

2627134 but i suspect that in the years to come what most historians and perhaps the rest of us too will think of when we hear the date august 8 2008 is not china and certainly not old with the hair the mistress and pathetic claims of being
2627135 i suppose if we are thinking about turning our country over to the second carter term or the first mcgovern it shouldnt surprise anyone to see russia go into its aghanistan mode or czechoslovakia or hungary or as roger reminds us georgia
2627136 debka file s geopolitical experts note that on the surface level the russians are backing the separatists of s ossetia and neighboring abkhazia as payback for the strengthening of american influence in tiny georgia and its 4 5 million inhabitants however more immediately the conflict has been sparked by the race for control over the pipelines carrying oil and gas out of the caspian region the russians may just bear with the pro us georgian president mikhail saakashvilis ambition to bring his country into nato but they draw a heavy line against his plans and those of western oil companies including israeli firms to route the oil routes from azerbaijan and the gas lines from turkmenistan which transit georgia through turkey instead of hooking them up to russian pipelines saakashvili need only back away from this plan for moscow to ditch the two provinces revolt against tbilisi as long as he sticks to his guns south ossetia and abkhazia will wage separatist wars
2627137 the kremlin went down to georgia our friends in the caucasus need help
2627138 instability in georgia in the short term and a non nato georgia in the long term would destroy georgias value as a strategic energy corridor a democratic example and a key u s military partner the only central asian oil not from russia or iran passes through georgia via the baku tbilisi ceyhan btc pipeline at a volume of up to 1 million barrels a day conflict with russia would lessen or eliminate this energy supply a greater petroleum monopoly would further empower moscow and tehran conflict in the caucasus would push up oil prices already nearing 125 a barrel hurting american consumers anguished by nearly 4 a gallon gas
2627139 thus when the russian news agency announces that georgia is about to invade abkhazia it may mean that georgia really is about to invade abkhazia but it might also mean as everyone in the region understands that russia is about to invade georgia as a preemptive strike of course

2627159 to be information literate a person must be able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate evaluate and use effectively the needed information
2627160 a new liberal art that extends from knowing how to use computers and access information to critical reflection on the nature of information itself its technical infrastructure and its social cultural and philosophical context and impact

2627168 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2627169 sen mccain is clearly willing to note who he thinks is the aggressor here
2627170 i dont think you can excuse defend explain or make allowance for russian behavior because of what is going on in georgia
2627171 thats kind of like saying after saddam hussein invaded kuwait that kuwait and iraq need to show restraint or like saying in 1968 when the soviet union invaded czechoslovakia that the czechoslovaks should show restraint
2627172 john mccain was there a month ago in this community and was asked a question about this dhl issue and did not say one word about his role in this or the role of his campaign manager that is the furthest thing from straight talk that we can imagine

2627187 one of the issues we will have to deal with this field wont be as big of an issue but some of those other fields the empty heads out there we are going to have to figure out a way to shred them and knock out them small heads to get them to germinate before we put the crop in next year

2627189 the wheat and the barley people are turning claims in right now there is nothing there alot of them figure they are not even going to combine it the hay fields alot of them are getting zeroed they are zeroing out the hay fields there is just nothing there
2627190 in our case we are more diversified we got the farming operation we did get some hail storms on our winter wheat up north but fortunately it created an opportunity to go make some feed

2627208 he can be moody and he needs constant re assurance but if i was stuck in a jail cell with another man for 50 years to life sasha is the definitely the guy i would want as a cell mate
2627209 our collective chi should be channeled for individual body mind discovery and consciousness first before we can attain the plane of awareness needed for group self actualization

2627211 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2627212 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2627213 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2627214 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2627215 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2627216 this government will meet its responsibility to help those in need but policies that increase dependency break up families and destroy self respect are not progressive theyre reactionary despite our strides in civil rights blacks hispanics and all minorities will not have full and equal power until they have full economic power
2627217 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2627218 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2627280 one of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bulklshit
2627281 bullshit is unavoidable whenever circumstances require someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about thus the production of bullshit is stimulated whenever a persons obligations or opportunities to speak about some topic are more excessive than his knowledge of the facts that are relevant to that topic this discrepancy is common in public life where people are frequently impelled whether by their own propensities or by the demands of others to speak extensively about matters of which they are to some degree ignorant closely related instances arise from the widespread conviction that it is the responsibility of a citizen in a democracy to have opinions about everything or at least everything that pertains to the conduct of his countrys affairs the lack of any significant connection between a persons opinions and his apprehension of reality will be even more severe needless to say for someone who believes it his responsibility as a conscientious moral agent to evaluate events and conditions in all parts of the world
2627282 the contemporary proliferation of bullshit also has deeper sources in various forms of skepticism which deny that we can have any reliable access to an objective reality and which therefore reject the possibility of knowing how things truly are

2627337 no because you can not bribe god with good deeds its like your friend rapping and murdering a girl then for five years does nothing but good deeds then dies and tells god well i know i murdered and killed a girl but i was good after that gandi is not a saint he sinned no matter what whether it was lying at some point or lusting etc when dealing with god you either accept him or your dont gondi denied him because of his free will and did not obey god there for god is not his savior and he will not be save from hell

2627352 it has nothing to do with piracy concerns it has to do with different business terms expectations in that sector and more importantly generally prevailing pricing of pc digital games versus their console counterparts the typical downloadable price for digital only games on pc is actually 19 99
2627353 another consideration is that our distribution costs as a percentage are on average slightly higher on pc than console
2627354 in several cases we have another party beyond just the distribution portals taking an extra bite driving down our share of the revenue for example affiliate sites of our portal partners take a well earned slice of revenue for every sale then the portal gets its cut then we get ours three mouths to feed

2627391 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2627392 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio
2627393 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
2627394 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado

2627456 the stocks most sensitive to oil prices are the ones doing the best today but its also a really broad rally
2627457 investors are responding to the decline in commodity prices that weve seen recently
2627458 theyre rotating out of the fundamentally strongest groups and into sectors that may benefit going forward if oil prices continue to retreat
2627459 i dont think the u s consumer is going to come roaring back but some of these sectors are really depressed
2627460 a stronger dollar would be very bullish for stocks in terms of restoring faith globally in the u s marketplace
2627461 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2627462 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2627463 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2627464 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2627465 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2627466 its really sad after the celebration of the opening ceremonies which were the best opening ceremonies ive ever been at
2627467 to the best of my knowledge this is a random action and not targeted at americans its just that you dont expect something to happen in a country like this
2627468 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2627469 the chinese government will try not to let this event have a serious impact on u s china relations

2627472 i telephoned him president sidi ould cheikh abdallahi personally to explain to him the gravity of his decree and suggest he postpone it to avoid the worst
2627473 i explained to him how it could have serious consequences how it could lead to military engagements death and destruction and that it would be best to reconsider his decision but he was stubborn
2627474 it was our duty to remind him of his humanitarian responsibilities to try to dissuade him but he chose to ignore us just as in the same manner he tried to destroy the country and block its institutions
2627475 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2627476 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2627477 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2627478 hi haley im trying to see if we can work in some time for you in the next couple of weeks the schedule is pretty full already how much time would you need

2627485 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2627486 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2627487 our unomig military observers report ongoing military preparation by the abkhaz de facto authorities for a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2627488 this is a conflict that is expanding and getting out of control
2627489 the proximate cause is the massive escalation perpetrated by outside forces
2627490 the georgians have made an offer of a ceasefire and its concerning that the russians wont respond to that
2627491 its clear that the russians are looking to prolong the conflict in some way because they will give no assurances either about a cessation of hostilities or about withdrawing their forces
2627492 there is great dispute and controversy about the origins of this including prior mobilisation of russian troops on the other side of the georgian border
2627493 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2627494 we were focused on the products that were going out for grinding
2627495 we were focusing on the product that we tied to the initial illnesses

2627501 i feel really bad for other people who bought that app like me because public ridicule is so hurtful were real people with real lives and lots of money not morons like everyone is reporting
2627502 rich morons with lots of money and real lives buying stupid
2627503 bad things always happen to me sometimes twice a day
2627504 it all began 75 million years ago back then there was a galactic federation of planets which was ruled over by the evil lord xenu xenu thought his galaxy was overpopulated and so he rounded up countless aliens from all different planets and then had those aliens frozen the frozen alien bodies were loaded onto xenus galactic cruisers which looked like dc 8s except with rocket engines the cruisers then took the frozen alien bodies to our planet earth and dumped them into the volcanoes of hawaii the aliens were no longer frozen they were dead the souls of those aliens however lived on and all floated up towards the sky but the evil lord xenu had prepared for this xenu didnt want their souls to return and so he built giant soul catchers in the sky the souls were taken to a huge soul brain washing facility which xenu had also built on earth there the souls were forced to watch days of brainwashing material which tricked them into believing a false reality xenu then released the alien souls which roamed the earth aimlessly in a fog of confusion at the dawn of man the souls finally found bodies which they could grab onto they attached themselves to all mankind which still to this day causes all our fears our confusions and our problems
2627505 i do not believe that fish evolved into mammals i do not think that it is physically chemically possible

2627509 i think london is much more likely to be the model for the games in the future
2627510 i wouldnt be afraid or daunted by these big figures or the scale of what you see in china just hold faith with the great games that were going to host in london in just four years time
2627511 i dont think theres a lot of learning to be had from previous host cities because every host city is different

2627542 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2627543 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2627544 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2627545 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2627546 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2627547 the fact that they could hire a woman with such a deplorable record is in keeping with dhs pattern of incompetence overall said melanie sloan executive director citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington a non profit government watchdog group
2627548 the hiring was a mistake of one kind or another said ellen howe a tsa spokeswoman
2627549 tsa does have a policy of googling potential employees however it started at a level above this position howe said
2627550 were going to change that and make it broader and deeper into the organization
2627551 these arent the type of people you need at an agency responsible for crisis management where judgment is paramount sloan said
2627552 i continue to be extremely troubled that she was ever hired klobuchar said
2627553 i believe this will lead to significant changes in their hiring practices
2627554 gaping hole in executive ranks at the agency that could lead to heightened vulnerability to terrorist attack
2627555 if someone comes to tsa and they have an existing security clearance that puts them a step ahead in terms of bringing them in faster howe said

2627887 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity

2627961 now im just happy to be here and the most important thing for us was the raising of our flag
2627962 were all proud because this is his home turf where he learned about politics and trade unions and thanks to his struggle there have been important changes
2627963 im going to vote for evo because hes always going to support us
2627964 there was death before in chapare and now we have peace
2627965 the coca leaf pays for our studies our clothes our health
2627966 i am very happy all of china is very happy

2627970 i wont know whether to help him or beat him up
2627971 it felt like i was back on my home court like i was competing in taiwan
2627972 but i wasnt really thinking about it i was just trying to be serious and play each game well
2627973 i was excited when i saw our blue flag being waved in the stadium
2627974 even though we are in anarchy for a few hours yesterday we were no different than developed countries like the united states spain germany or canada
2627975 it reminded me of our heyday before the civil war
2627976 we were watching the opening carnival with great interest but we switched it off when we heard the gunfire
2627977 the main stadium there is now a military base so we trained on the highways and at the smaller banadir stadium
2627978 sometimes the violence stopped us from attending training but we are determined to do well
2627979 its the best name we could get because of its speed and power
2627980 many here are poor and cannot afford to install a satellite dish to watch the olympics
2627981 our main priority is to see the somali flag being hosted here
2627982 we have a young team and although we hope they will do well our desire is to see our flag among the other countries participating in the olympics
2627983 after all air pollution was a major concern in los angeles 24 years ago
2627984 though few now seem to recall the dramatic scene at the end of the womens marathon when the swiss competitor was seen staggering and stumbling from exhaustion the heat and perhaps the effects of air pollution
2627985 air quality was also an issue for subsequent olympic games in barcelona atlanta seoul and athens
2627986 without doubt beijing is facing a huge challenge there are real and understandable concerns for the health of competitors especially those in endurance and long distance events but the current frenzied focus is marked by considerable amnesia
2627987 for us the olympic games are not the be all and end all they are the means to a larger end
2627988 its not just trees that have been planted its an ecological experiment
2627989 its a whole new green lung for the people of beijing
2627990 beijing is striving to be part of the green team
2627991 on the chinese side they are more pragmatic but its a tango by both sides to make changes
2627992 but in each case china with the shared efforts of other parties has succeeded in defusing tensions and improving ties japan is an outstanding example
2627993 the people who are in power now in both tokyo and beijing really see it in their interests to promote and work towards stability
2627994 of course the history issue is here as a permanent irritant but that doesnt mean you cant try to control it and promote regional integration thats where were headed for the time being they have stopped yelling and screaming at each other
2627995 i think aso is more of an opportunist than an ideologue horvat said
2627996 we are just going to say that our hearts go out to her and her family
2627997 tang has no criminal record his neighbors said they hadnt seen any abnormal behavior from him before left hangzhou
2627998 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families

2628000 we know we have to have a well diversified portfolio
2628001 to say buy nestle because its a swiss company really doesnt make any sense anymore
2628002 what drives a companys earnings what they do or where they are
2628003 global companies that are working hand in hand with government and private entities around the world to build stuff and to help to create the environment where these countries can grow
2628004 its hard to talk about companies in sound bite terms

2628007 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2628008 the surge has succeeded yet senator obama commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2628009 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2628010 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge

2628035 soil erosion constitutes the greatest danger for hilly land as it brings about a drastic reduction in the depth fertility and productivity of earth and foliage
2628036 around 8 percent of agricultural land in our country should no longer be cultivated as it is virtually desertland but it is being tilled by farmers who want to justify their subsidies which should be granted on the basis of ground productivity not surface area

2628040 we only have two big guys but we are two years older and we have some of the same guys that have been through this
2628041 what we do with bradley is we will put him in the backfield to take the snap but then he takes off
2628042 he averaged about 110 to 140 yards last year and had one game where he went over 200 besides that he will also be our punt and kick returner as well
2628043 gabriel is a solid hitter at 5 foot 10 180 pounds
2628044 both corey and reid can catch the ball and josh is another big kid at about 6 foot 1 210 pounds the rest of the players will be freshmen
2628045 we need to make bigger plays and understand the game better especially on defense
2628046 if we can understand how to stop our opponents we will be better off
2628047 they are huge and fast they have a kid who is 6 foot 8 and fast but then again brenham will be tough as well as bellville faith

2628060 concert posters were the foundation to get me seen but now that im there i want to use my freedom
2628061 the fine art community never has and never will really respect poster art they tolerate it but they only tolerate it from guys who paint
2628062 there are only probably about four or five current artists in the entire concert poster scene that sell through prints like jermaine does
2628063 you cant really have a conversation about concertposter artists from the 90s to now without jermaines name coming up
2628064 he is definitely one of the very important names among modern rock artists
2628065 theyll know within 10 feet of the door if they like it or not
2628066 i probably thought it was freaky too the first time i saw it but im around it all the time and ive found other meanings
2628067 i dont want to be portrayed that way id like people to come to the art with an open mind and challenge what you are taught to think

2628082 it felt great for us as a team to move the ball that way
2628083 we continued to keep fighting and we persevered through all of those penalties and i think that it shows the character and focus of this team
2628084 we had a couple of missed formations a couple of forced passes a couple of inaccurate throws but thats going to happen in a preseason game thats why were playing these games we want to work those kinks out

2628120 the coalition has decided that it will immediately initiate impeachment proceedings against general retd musharraf
2628121 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance
2628122 hes alive somewhere now but hes not going to become this awesome figure that we nickname the anti christ until satan possesses him and i dont believe that will occur until there is this mortal wound from which hes raised up
2628123 who is the liar but the one who denies that jesus is the christ this is the antichrist the one who denies the father and the son
2628124 for many deceivers have gone out into the world those who do not acknowledge jesus christ as coming in the flesh this is the deceiver and the antichrist
2628125 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
2628126 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
2628127 even at the insurgencys peak we never faced such a grim situation these religious riots are the worst i remember
2628128 theyve driven a wedge between hindus and muslims who were living as brothers
2628129 left six dead and hundreds injured the congress led regional regime said it devised the plan to transfer land to the shrine trust as pilgrim numbers were rising and more shelters were needed
2628130 this is the most polarised situation ive seen in a generation
2628131 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
2628132 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
2628133 establishment administration and police are sponsoring and fanning the sectarian violence in jammu occupational conspiracy of india is being materialized in jammu region this time
2628134 racist forces in jammu have unleashed a reign of terror in jammu and administration and police is acting as mute spectator it is highly condemnable
2628135 hindu fanatic groups like bjp rss vhp praja parishad and panun kashmir are anti peace and just want to spread communal hatred and divide the state on religious basis which is highly condemnable
2628136 the attacks on kashmiri drivers and their vehicles kashmir bound passengers attempts of economic blockade destroying and looting fruit bound for different markets of the country will have disastrous consequences if immediate steps to secure the highway are not taken
2628137 jammu agitation is a conspiracy to split the state in pieces some vested interests are hell bent on to spread hatred among the people of the state
2628138 the fact that the jammu administration had to black out two local television news channels and seal the offices of two hindi dailies for allegedly whipping up communal passions shows the serious fallout of this stir
2628139 this is the most polarised situation i have seen in a generation i think before the situation is tackled tempers have to cool down
2628140 it is terrible and the animosities run so deep what is more frightening is that the integrity of the state has come into question the entire situation has been so badly handled for such selfish gains
2628141 this is the most polarised situation i have seen in a generation i think before the situation is tackled tempers have to cool down
2628142 one needs to step back from the brink and handle this very carefully its sitting literally on a tinderbox
2628143 it is terrible and the animosities run so deep what is more frightening is that the integrity of the state has come into question the entire situation has been so badly handled for such selfish gains
2628144 cutting off the lifeline to the state by blocking the srinagar jammu highway for several days now is extremely serious as a result kashmir is facing a shortage of medicines especially life saving drugs and businessmen are talking of transporting goods through muzaffarabad can you ever imagine this scenario
2628145 the fact that the jammu administration had to black out two local television news channels and seal the offices of two hindi dailies for allegedly whipping up communal passions shows the serious fallout of this stir
2628146 i have never seen a situation like this in a very long time but who is responsible
2628147 in lal chowk the heart of srinagar against the governments inability to curb communal violence
2628148 the authorities have imposed a false curfew in jammu this communal lot from himachal pradesh and punjab who are siding with the protesters have to be isolated and i will ensure that those in the valley do not play into their hands
2628149 after centuries we have reached the harbour of our freedom
2628150 i shall first speak on the merits and demerits of the states accession to india in the final analysis as i understand it it is the kinship of ideals which determines the strength of ties between two states the indian constitution has set before the country the goal of secular democracy based upon justice freedom and equality for all without distinction this is the bedrock of modern democracy this should meet the argument that the muslims of kashmir can not have security in india where the large majority of the population are hindus
2628151 the indian constitution has amply and finally repudiated the concept of a religious state
2628152 you will get a sense of how jammu has decided to give kashmir a taste of its own medicine in this case it is dum dum dawai a public thrashing
2628153 anti social elements who took no time in joining the agitation have attacked muslims at many places and communal clashes have taken place in muslim majority areas
2628154 few and protest by few is turned into a major clash otherwise wherein j amp k a communal unrest has taken place in a muslim majority area
2628155 bordering china and linking xinjiang through the karakoram highway in the north afghanistan and tajikistan through the narrow wakhan corridor to the west
2628156 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
2628157 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
2628158 americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pak afghan border
2628159 in the strongest evidence based confrontation with the american security establishment since the two countries established their post 9 11 strategic alliance pakistani officials proved brahamdagh bugtis presence in afghan intelligence safe houses in kabul his photographed visits to new delhi and his orders for terrorism in balochistan
2628160 we wanted to know when our american friends would get interested in tracking down the terrorists responsible for hundreds of suicide bombings in pakistan and those playing havoc with our natural resources in balochistan while sitting in kabul and delhi

2628178 there is a strong feeling in the group that the east side has not been as aggressive in advocating for transportation systems as the west side has
2628179 as a result were simply not on a high priority in terms of the metropolitan council plan compared to others
2628180 in order to really plan that area we need to know what transportation systems and improvements there are for the future
2628181 but now with the rising cost of energy its become the linchpin in terms of the areas that will prosper and the areas that will struggle

2628193 nuestra iniciativa m s popular en el rea de tecnolog a es por lejos la de multicore en m ltiple n cleo estamos viendo un resurgir de la industria del software y los multicore son interesantes si escribimos software para aprovecharlos

2628195 cuando utilizamos dual core y quad core y comenzamos a expandir el uso de estos n cleos requerimos un cambio en la forma en que los desarrolladores escriben los c digos para aprovechar mejor esta infraestructura
2628196 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
2628197 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
2628198 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
2628199 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
2628200 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
2628201 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
2628202 when it comes to exceptional or extreme drought exceptionally high temperatures the historical assumption that this occurred once every 20 years has now been revised down to between every one and two years
2628203 now this is a serious revision of the impact of climate change on drought
2628204 therefore there is no credible basis for the claims of increasing frequency of exceptional circumstances declarations made in the report these results are consistent with other studies finding lack of adequate validation in global warming effects modeling and lack of skill of climate models at the regional scale except in the few cases noted above the model simulations have no resemblance to patterns of observed droughtedness in the last century we conclude the models have failed internal validation and no further testing is warranted
2628205 deserts are a larger sink for carbon dioxide than had previously been assumed
2628206 id be hugely surprised if this were the missing sink if deserts are taking up a lot of carbon it ought to be obvious
2628207 you would think that seemingly lifeless places must be carbon neutral or carbon sources
2628208 concluded that the hockey stick was flawed but the sort of data on which it was based are still evidence of unprecedented warming
2628209 finding flaws doesnt mean mann et al s claims are wrong he told barton
2628210 the last few decades were likely the warmest of the millennium
2628211 it can be said with a high level of confidence that global mean surface temperature was higher during the last few decades of the 20th century than during any comparable period during the preceding four centuries
2628212 finds it plausible that the northern hemisphere was warmer during the last few decades of the 20th century than during any comparable period over the preceding millennium
2628213 we also question some of the statistical choices made in the original papers by dr mann and his colleagues
2628214 an ill advised step in manns statistical analysis may have created the hockey stick wegman said
2628215 you can go outside and spit and have the same effect as doubling carbon dioxide
2628216 if were to have even a medium sized solar minimum we could be looking at a lot more bad effects than global warming would have had
2628217 the global warming alarm is dressed up as science but it is not science it is propaganda i was horrified to read the ipcc 2nd and 3rd assessment reports because there was so much misinformation
2628218 mosquito species that transmit malaria do not usually survive where the mean winter temperature drops below 16 18 degrees c
2628219 in fact mosquitoes are extremely abundant in the arctic the most devastating epidemic of malaria was in the soviet union in the 1920s there were something like 13 million cases a year and something like 600 000 deaths a tremendous catastrophe that reached up to the arctic circle arkhangel a city 300 miles further north than helsinki finland had 30 000 cases and about 10 000 deaths so its not a tropical disease yet these people in the global warming fraternity invent the idea that malaria will move northward
2628220 they are not going extinct or even appear to be affected
2628221 how could it be determined that so many thermometers were wrong by an average of 0 5 degrees in one particular year several decades ago and an accurate retrofit be made why is the adjustment 0 5 degrees one year and 0 1 degrees the next
2628222 i am baffled by the mann claim that incorrect mathematics doesnt matter because the answer is correct anyway
2628223 not because they were wrong indeed these measurements were made by top scientists including two nobel prize winners using techniques that are standard textbook procedures the only reason for rejection was that these measurements did not fit the hypothesis of anthropogenic global warming i regard this as perhaps the greatest scientific scandal of our time
2628224 the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005 the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650 000 years 180 to 300 ppm as determined from ice cores
2628225 plagued with improper manipulation of data an arbitrary rejection of high readings from old ice and an arbitrary rejection of low readings from young ice simply because they did not fit the preconceived idea of man made global warming
2628226 what frustrates me is the feeling that everything has already been said and published that all rational argument has been used yet it does not help
2628227 trend toward abandoning scientific objectivity in favor of political agendas
2628228 reason environmental extremism emerged was because world communism failed the berlin wall came down and a lot of peaceniks and political activists moved into the environmental movement bringing their neo marxism with them and learned to use green language in a very clever way to cloak agendas that actually have more to do with anticapitalism and antiglobalism than they do anything with ecology or science
2628229 i think if we dont overthrow capitalism we dont have a chance of saving the world ecologically
2628230 the deceit behind the attempts to discredit evidence of climate change reveals matters of importance this deceit has a clear purpose to confuse the public about the status of knowledge of global climate change thus delaying effective action to mitigate climate change the danger is that delay will cause tipping points to be passed such that large climate impacts become inevitable the ones who will live in infamy if we pass the tipping points are the captains of industry ceos in fossil fuel companies such as exxon mobil automobile manufacturers utilities all of the leaders who have placed short term profit above the fate of the planet and the well being of our children
2628231 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
2628232 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
2628233 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
2628234 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child
2628235 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
2628236 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added
2628237 well make sure that you cant get around our rules on family reunification by going through back doors
2628238 the government considers the ruling to be wrong its incompatible with the eus efforts at combating illegal immigration
2628239 the european court of justice must not be allowed to determine denmarks policy on foreigners
2628240 its not a matter of just a small corner of our foreigner policy
2628241 im ashamed of a country that supposedly stands for freedom and democracy and has now put so many people in this situation
2628242 but when i weigh it out the potential gain is so huge versus the risk
2628243 it would be a pretty big undertaking for a community or a city council to try and shepherd a bill through the process
2628244 you want your police chief to be in your city not at the capitol
2628245 can i saw with absolute certainty that we would not have gotten that money without legislative consultants no
2628246 but did it help did it assist did it help promote absolutely it has paid dividends for us
2628247 it was very much like having a city staff person who has a vital interest in this issue there at the legislature each day
2628248 but a city staff person never would have known the system well enough to do that
2628249 without professional assistance i dont think the city would stand much of a chance
2628250 with it i think we will have a very good chance
2628251 its best to put a happy face on things like this
2628252 i know the air looks bad but i dont know if it is as bad as it looks i didnt feel it
2628253 i was looking at a newspaper picture of the horses in hong kong site of the olympic equestrian events with swamp coolers in front of them
2628254 but this definitely was among my top 10 hardest races
2628255 i got goose bumps in the heat and thats probably not a good thing i have ridden in conditions like that tons of times but never for so long
2628256 it was so humid that going up hills you just couldnt breathe and the sweat wouldnt come off you
2628257 it feels like you have hot cream all over your body
2628258 right now we have basically the same offensive line i played with against the new york giants last season and they did a great job
2628259 that looks like what would be the starting lineup and i feel great about it
2628260 i dont waste and energy talking about stuff i know my abilities
2628261 everybody needs a guy like that who can play guard play tackle he caught my first touchdown pass last year he was a tight end at some point of his career so hes an athletic big guy who can move

2628275 by the end of 1972 there had been four straight sugar seasons with record crops yet consumption actually outpaced supplies in 1972 literally eating into sugar inventories over the next year the 1973 74 sugar season began with extremely tight supply conditions worldwide demand continued to rise
2628276 there was evidence that some big industry users were stockpiling sugar in anticipation of higher prices
2628277 everyone had a theory for the high prices sugar traders had no idea where prices might be when the uss long standing price supports expired at the end of 1974 some blamed the high prices on a scarcity of cheap labour to harvest sugarcane others pointed to the failure of the european sugar beet crop others even suspected that both the soviet union which had just suffered two bad production years in a row in its own sugar crop and arab oil money remember that oil crisis of the 1970s had moved into the sugar futures markets along with a rise in speculation by others looking to make money from rising prices

2628280 russian jet fighters have dropped three bombs on tbilisis airport
2628281 there is no sign that anything has been stepped up as far as security is concerned but people are obviously nervous and concerned after the three loud explosions were reportedly heard
2628282 the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2628283 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on non use of force with south ossetians
2628284 expressed grave concern on the further deterioration of the situation
2628285 and it is clear that the conflict has now expanded to other areas of georgia than only south ossetia
2628286 civilians were hit very hard by these attacks allegedly targeting military facilities but not doing a very good job of it
2628287 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2628288 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate ceasefire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2628289 earlier today russian jet fighters bombed two villages in the upper part of the gorge
2628290 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2628291 a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2628292 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2628293 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2628294 russia is saying that it is actually responding to a direct attack on its citizens and on its peace keepers in south ossetia
2628295 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2628296 the surge has succeeded yet commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2628297 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2628298 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2628299 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance but could still be squandered by hasty withdrawals or arbitrary timelines

2628304 wtf oh well thatll only take a few hours and that sort of smoke and mirrors as a fallback will be able to fool the execs if we get stuck doing the port for real

2628325 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2628326 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2628327 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2628328 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2628329 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2628330 look my paycheck arrived in the mail one week after i worked
2628331 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2628332 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2628333 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2628334 todos est o esperando pelo alvorecer para come ar as opera es a ge rgia enfrenta uma cat strofe humanit ria

2628345 in the future intelligent men will read in amazement about the murder of caryl chessman
2628346 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2628347 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2628349 the world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page
2628350 in the past five years we have addressed common technical and business issues that go beyond desktop integration such as providing a method to support agent training in contact centers using routines or alternative approaches to navigating application screens the new desktop productivity packs not only resolve these issues but do it without having to reinvent the wheel
2628351 our new best practice tools also provide a roadmap for companies when integrating applications further reducing training and implementation time we will continue to include additional productivity packs with the cicero platform to address business requirements and our customer requests
2628352 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2628353 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2628354 yes computers and it systems are great when they are working
2628355 but when they are not then the experience and knowledge of staff plays a vital role
2628356 by the end of june 2008 the center that serves the nine county bay area expects to fill 138 of 147 authorized positions
2628357 first we are going to set up a one stop centre providing directory services and strive to create a database of say 400 000 clients
2628358 then we will expand our portfolio to provide services like customer care data entry indexing and telemarketing for banks and telecom companies
2628359 this is the outcome of a review that will see through a partnership with ibm employees of xerox seamlessly transfer to ibm all 900 staff will have the same terms and conditions of their employment and will remain at the same facility
2628360 growth in outsourcing of services including customer care services is being driven by competitive pressures forcing corporate clients to improve their organizational focus and structure outsourcing a variety of non core functions allows management to focus on core business operations free up resources and better utilize existing assets
2628361 specific benefits of outsourced customer care include higher quality service at reduced costs access to best practices and specialized expertise which would be difficult and costly for an in house staff to replicate
2628362 these customers were calling to a degree that we felt was excessive
2628363 were working very hard to improve customer service thats our number one priority
2628364 these were the customers that had nothing to do but call us every single day demanding credit and they were getting it because customer care was getting exhausted from arguinjg with them so a nickel at a time these custoemrs were collecting literally thousands of dollars in credit balances
2628365 having a timely consistent experience across all channels significantly improves productivity customer satisfaction and retention particularly in the competitive world of financial services
2628366 delivering rich targeted content and seamless escalation to assisted service channels are key enablers of sustained self service adoption weve found this will drive 80 percent resolution on first contact for escalated online interactions and improve customer satisfaction ratings by 90 percent
2628367 the proactive capabilities in cim 8 0 are state of the art and exactly what pitney bowes needs to take the customer experience to the next level
2628368 the new agent interface is sleek user friendly and will help our agents improve productivity
2628369 talisma voip and real time offer engine are two major additions to cim 8 0 that not only offer slick and differentiating functionality but also solve a major pain point for companies wanting to add additional support channels
2628370 i would go so far as to say that talismas solution is elegant
2628371 surveying is a tactical activity that has strategic implications and benefits for the entire enterprise it should be a required element in all customer or constituent facing strategies
2628372 obviously where interest rates are is a matter for the reserve bank and it acts independently and we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates acting prime minister julia gillard told abc television
2628373 but if interest rates were to fall then we expect banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2628374 treasurer wayne swan has already made clear were making it easier for people to switch loans so they can be there looking for the best possible deal
2628375 thats the thing everyone feeds off each other and you put a lot of pressure on the pitchers
2628376 when you look up and down our lineup and everyones clicking youre going to score a lot of runs and we have it all going right now
2628377 after vladdys home run im like ok we got our one run now lets battle then we just kept scoring and it was fun to watch
2628378 edwar wasnt making the quality pitches weve seen him make all year
2628379 eddie has been very good for us and we needed him to bounce back i believe that edwar can get anyone out when he makes his pitches yes hes had two blips in the last nine days against the angels but i know hes better than that
2628380 you feel terrible for giese because the kid pitched great
2628381 he did nothing except what we asked him to do hes got a limit of 85 pitches and he gives us six innings and shuts down a very good offense except for one home run by teixeira his effort was tremendous and it would have been great to get him the win
2628382 hes got a different delivery with the pauses that he has
2628383 its something you just dont see every day so it messes up your timing and its hard to get a good rhythm against him he pitched great but eventually we got something going
2628384 that foul tip came straight down but when we saw where on the hand he was hit we were confident he could keep playing if he got his strength back
2628385 if it hit him in the thumb or on a bone thats dangerous territory but it got him right on the palm so we were pretty comfortable that he could finish the game
2628386 you know that when you face john lackey youre in for a tough game so youve got to take advantage of the opportunities that you get
2628387 when you dont sometimes they come back to haunt you
2628388 moscow may be expected to punish israel for its intervention
2628389 does georgia bear some responsibility of course it does without question
2628390 throughout this whole period we have forcefully or vigorously pressed the georgian government to be measured and to avoid at all costs any military conflict with russian forces and to avoid any escalation so we have been quite clear
2628391 for the life of me i cant image that being a proportionate response to the charge that georgia has attacked russian peacekeepers
2628392 its hard for us to understand what russias plan is here
2628393 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2628394 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2628395 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2628396 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2628397 we were focused on the products that were going out for grinding
2628398 we were focusing on the product that we tied to the initial illnesses
2628399 the nature of his injuries were such that in spite of their efforts his life could not be saved
2628400 no matter where he worked or who he worked with he just fit in well with everybody
2628401 he was a very outgoing likeable man and will be missed
2628402 we at the second battalion now focus our efforts on ensuring he is laid to rest with the honour and dignity he deserves
2628403 there was a civilian convoy in the vicinity and the incident will be investigated
2628404 the death of roberts is being investigated and until we have conclusive results of the investigation i cant give you a definitive statement
2628405 without private security firms it would be impossible to achieve what were achieving here
2628406 private contractors routinely operate within the battle space and they provide essential security to a lot of development and stabilization groups
2628407 i dont know whether they had a legitimate target or not
2628408 theres going to be an investigation into all of this activity

2628414 a no nonsense kind of guy who lived like people dreamed
2628415 he was a fun loving and genuine individual who was totally dedicated to the army and held his section together he looked out for his guys in ways they probably didnt realize
2628416 the nature of his injuries were such that in spite of their efforts his life could not be saved
2628417 no matter where he worked or who he worked with he just fit in well with everybody
2628418 he was a very outgoing likeable man and will be missed
2628419 we at the second battalion now focus our efforts on ensuring he is laid to rest with the honour and dignity he deserves

2628421 the death of roberts is being investigated and until we have conclusive results of the investigation i cant give you a definitive statement
2628422 without private security firms it would be impossible to achieve what were achieving here
2628423 private contractors routinely operate within the battle space and they provide essential security to a lot of development and stabilization groups
2628424 i dont know whether they had a legitimate target or not
2628425 theres going to be an investigation into all of this activity

2628430 he love soldiering some people are calling it a tragedy but he died doing what he loved so thats not a tragedy
2628431 a no nonsense kind of guy who lived like people dreamed
2628432 he was a fun loving and genuine individual who was totally dedicated to the army and held his section together he looked out for his guys in ways they probably didnt realize
2628433 their poison will kill you and dont sample the blossoms either theyll make you very ill
2628434 oh i wish there was time to take a nap
2628435 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
2628436 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
2628437 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
2628438 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
2628439 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
2628440 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
2628441 we could not have asked for a better result today three american flags being raised on the first day of the fencing event so i am just really really proud and really happy
2628442 it is really everybody my goal is just to be as prepared as i can be and if i am then i will be satisfied

2628445 there were no physical eyewitnesses to the accident but there were witnesses that heard the airplane flying and heard it flying previous to the accident

2628447 i dont remember a time when three prominent men of such great caliber were taken at one time
2628448 there are still outstanding issues that need to be resolved to our satisfaction the dup will not be content until every last vestige of ira structures has disappeared
2628449 patently choreographed move to ease the implementation of the dups deal with ira sinn fein over policing and justice
2628450 whatever the imc agrees to say no ira acolyte such as mcguinness should ever be allowed to exercise justice powers and yet this is precisely what the dup is seeking to do
2628451 the ira have clearly gone off the stage and have done so since 2005
2628452 but theres still attempts being made by some people to drag them back on and i think thats silly
2628453 these gloves had better last forever because i intend to be buried in them
2628454 anjis sweet sweet sweet sweet voice i remember the first time i ever heard her way back in the day i said she could read me a chinese menu or the phone book and i would be all happy

2628471 getting justice dignity and compensation for survivors of childhood sexual abuse is what matters

2628474 at some point the employer is responsible for training students in the details of the jobs
2628475 its amazing that someone can build an entire discipline out of studying the movement of water through rock
2628476 of course it isnt what do you want from me im not a saint just very bored and tragically hungover leave me alone
2628477 hmm thats a very tempting offer but i have to be awake early for work so im going to stay in tonight
2628478 damn brennan you really shouldve held on to the porch tighter
2628479 i had many chances but many putts stopped just short of the cup
2628480 my coach said if youre in annikas group during the final round ill drive five hours from oslo norway and watch you play
2628481 i hope my coach will be here although i will not play with annika
2628482 on some holes you feel it more than others on the 18th they did the wave
2628483 im just going to go out and play my game and give it my best shot
2628484 im putting better than i was last year which is good
2628485 the only real difference that i might have kind of forgotten about last year was that it is 36 holes and its so important to stay patient just because i think its easy to get frustrated or worried but 36 holes is a lot of golf and really anything can happen im just going to make sure that i stay very patient
2628486 i didnt hit the ball as well as i have been at the beginning my driver was going a little left and the rough was just so thick that it kind of can be a little trickier
2628487 this was a really neat experience her game really taught me a lot the fact that she is a long hitter now i am going to work a little harder to hit it longer too i was a little nervous playing against her side by side but from the very first tee i was confident that i was going to do well today
2628488 it was really hard because i mean shes my best friend
2628489 it was really weird but i guess it is what it is we couldnt change who i was playing
2628490 i knew it was going to be a really hard match today because i knew she was playing awesome
2628491 i think shes really skillful and a really great player
2628492 she made it because her stroke is perfect i hope she can finish strong tomorrow
2628493 i climbed on my mothers lap and i kept saying why are you crying
2628494 and she kept saying nothing nothing and the more she hugged me the more emotional i got and i was crying too
2628495 the tv was on and it was the ed sullivan show and bill cosby was doing a routine about finding snakes in the bathroom i didnt know what he was talking about but my mother began to laugh she was laughing and crying and i began to laugh
2628496 in its first four days its had 1 8 million hits that shows that the community is very interested in the information it can provide
2628497 the liberal party wanders around saying its all a waste of time presumably they would abolish it presumably they believe in less information for consumers
2628498 but consumers recognise that in a competitive market the more information they can have the better and we agree and were determined to give them that information
2628499 we said before the election the biggest impact on grocery prices was international factors we said before the election the biggest henpeck on petrol prices was world oil prices and that continues to be the case
2628500 the now prime minister and now treasurer were asked can you guarantee to bring prices down they said before the election no but we will do whatever we can to put more competitive pressure in to the market
2628501 the only people who give false promises are those who say things like we can keep interest rates at record lows and promises they no they can never keep
2628502 this event demonstrates that the iraqi security forces and the government of iraq are committed to providing essential services and needed supplies to the local populace
2628503 mnd b soldiers are constantly out on the streets of baghdad partnering with the iraqi security forces and talking to the iraqi people
2628504 the result of our partnership and engagements as well as aggressive patrolling is recovering weapons and munitions caches that terrorists and criminal elements are trying to hide our message is simple we will not rest in our endeavors to provide safe neighborhoods for the residents of baghdad
2628505 our goal is to provide a secure environment so the iraqi government can take control and we can transition home
2628506 were the ones who came in here so its fine right
2628507 obviously i like the fact theyre all trying to catch me
2628508 they have to go deep to catch me if i keep making birdies
2628509 ive made myself shoot away from flags when i didnt feel comfortable and made a few less bogeys than in the past
2628510 you can make a bogey or two in amateur golf and still be somewhere near the lead
2628511 out here you drop a couple of shots and youre moving 40 spots the wrong way
2628512 i think the turnout is a great tribute to the team and these three players
2628513 i think people know this team is moving in the right direction and they wanted to come out and see these guys
2628514 this event gets me very excited for the season especially seeing the players here because i think this is a playoff team this year
2628515 im just ready for the season and this is a way to get started and get psyched for it
2628516 this is also a good way to come out and see people that you dont get to see during the summer weve got a lot of friends that weve met throughout the different seasons and this is our fourth season i start getting withdrawals during the summer so this is one of those ways to boost my fix
2628517 this is kind of a big deal and its really nice of them to do this for the fans
2628518 its indescribable what i think were going to have with him this season
2628519 i wouldnt miss this for the world in fact i just went and paid for my season tickets in full i didnt want to take any chances
2628520 when you walk up to the table and the guys greet you and its like youre neighbors or friends it adds a huge personal touch and you feel more invested in the team
2628521 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
2628522 its so b movie bad that you cant help but laugh at it
2628523 i am not sure how others will feel but striker was money on commentary for me
2628524 cole describing cenas style as pound and ground is ridiculous on so many levels
2628525 mike adamle might not have worked as a commentator but he might actually work as gm
2628526 the best part of raw was mike adamle people who criticize this guy need to
2628527 hice lo suficiente para asegurar la calle cuatro en la final

2628590 that was spectacular tonight the world was able to join in a magnificent tribute to the athletes and the olympic spirit it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games

2628596 before i was nine i had learned the basic canon of arab life it was me against my brother me and my brother against our father my family against my cousins and the clan the clan against the tribe and the tribe against the world and all of us against the infidel

2628604 we are trying to get to the top of the conference and to get three points in this game was important
2628605 this is a huge three points for us because it puts us above columbus and right up there behind new england
2628606 we ended up taking advantage of that situation where we had the 11 on 10 our guys moved the ball pretty well we had a little bit of luck on the first goal but sometimes you need that
2628607 he understands what it takes to play in this league and how to play he knew he was at fault for that first goal and he found himself in a spot where he was just alert enough to get in on the end of that play it was a great ball that marco pappa played across tomasz frankowski took a good shot and reis made a good save but wilman was there to tap it in
2628608 if you cant make it good at least make it look good
2628609 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2628610 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2628611 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2628612 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2628613 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2628614 tarek 23 has been searching for a wife since his first year in college with his parents full support and a steady job under his belt tarek began meeting girls through relatives friends and online none proved a match
2628615 she seemed to be waiting around the place almost as if she wanted me to say something but i just didnt know how to approach her
2628616 was she interested or was it just my imagination i didnt want to make it seem like i was hitting on her because it would probably turn her off it was mind boggling and disappointing because i didnt know what to do
2628617 it was a good start for vali not his best but very good he showed tremendous speed being out at the 50 faster than he ever has but unfortunately a small mistake at the turn was the difference regardless i was very pleased by the way he handled his first race in his very first olympics we came to play and that was clear he still has the 200 breast and the 400 medley relay events he was slightly disappointed but as i reminded him he is an olympian he represented his native romania and the university of louisville with great pride and poise

2628634 de manera que yo hermanos no pude hablaros como a espirituales sino como a carnales como a ni os en cristo os di a beber leche y no vianda porque a n no erais capaces ni sois capaces todav a porque a n sois carnales pues habiendo entre vosotros celos contiendas y disensiones no sois carnales y and is como hombres porque diciendo el uno yo ciertamente soy de pablo y el otro yo soy de apolos no sois carnales
2628635 porque debiendo ser ya maestros despu s de tanto tiempo ten is necesidad de que se os vuelva a ense ar cu les son los primeros rudimentos de las palabras de dios y hab is llegado a ser tales que ten is necesidad de leche y no de alimento s lido y todo aquel que participa de la leche es inexperto en la palabra de justicia porque es ni o pero el alimento s lido es para los que han alcanzado madurez para los que por el uso tienen los sentidos ejercitados en el discernimiento del bien y del mal
2628636 por tanto dejando ya los rudimentos de la doctrina de cristo vamos adelante a la perfecci n no echando otra vez el fundamento del arrepentimiento de obras muertas de la fe en dios de la doctrina de bautismos de la imposici n de manos de la resurrecci n de los muertos y del juicio eterno
2628637 no sea que estuviese haciendo un trabajo que no sirve
2628638 hay caminos que al hombre le parecen rectos pero que acaban por ser caminos de muerte
2628639 maldito el que no cumple todo lo de la ley
2628640 por el contrario vemos una iglesia ministros autorizados que realmente si se les desoyen se les desoye a cristo mateo 18 17
2628641 primero h ganle caso a la iglesia y despu s a la biblia
2628642 la decision del concilio de jerusalen tomada con el espiritu santo es decision dada por el mismo dios y nadie se le iba a ocurrir debatirle con la biblia a los apostoles
2628643 primero se predicaba con la interpretaci n de la iglesia
2628644 los fieles han de tener facil acceso a la sagrada escritura
2628645 aprended de m que soy manso y humilde de coraz n
2628646 el que no sabe gobernar su propia casa c mo cuidar de la iglesia de dios
2628647 si l es pastor y lo hizo yo mucho m s r pido
2628648 pero no escogi dios a lo vil y lo menospreciado no era pedro el ap stol un hombre imperfecto cuando fue llamado por jes s el se or a ser su disc pulo podr amos decir que dios escoge seg n nuestro criterio
2628649 21 cometer el delito por una motivaci n discriminatoria fundada en la raza color origen tnico edad sexo g nero religi n creencia opini n pol tica o de otra ndole nacimiento origen nacional cultural o socioecon mico idioma o lengua estado civil orientaci n sexual enfermedad discapacidad estructura gen tica o cualquiera otra condici n social o individual
2628650 no sab is que los injustos no heredar n el reino de dios no err is ni los fornicarios ni los id latras ni los ad lteros ni los afeminados ni los que se echan con varones ni los ladrones ni los avaros ni los borrachos ni los maldicientes ni los estafadores heredar n el reino de dios
2628651 mas el pueblo que conoce a su dios se esforzar y actuar
2628652 prefieren el calor de la mano que le estrecha el imp o que la verdad
2628653 no siento dar el dinero para mi familia mejor lo gasto con mis amigos
2628654 lo que pasa es que no sent hacer mi tarea
2628655 el problema no es que no sienta sino que no cree a lo que dios manda en la biblia
2628656 he aqui la sierva del se or hagase en mi segun tu palabra
2628657 yo siento de parte del se or esto o lo otro
2628658 oye c mo puede ser pues yo siento otra cosa
2628659 el sentimiento es parte de la condici n humana y sienten los sabios y los necios pero el deber y la raz n es cosa de honorables
2628660 la espiritualidad no es una especie de dictadura donde los creyentes esten obligados hacer tal o cual cosa
2628661 el gran l der y amo incuestionable del mundo entero
2628662 mas el consolador el espiritu santo a quien el padre enviara en mi nombre
2628663 por que l me ense cosas que ning n otro me ha ense ado
2628664 ser yo el parametro de interpretaci n de la escritura
2628665 ser miranda uno de ellos o ste si que es el verdadero y si es el verdadero qu pruebas hay de ello
2628666 los pecados que perdonasen le seran perdonas y los que retuviesen retenidos
2628667 si alguno dijere que el hombre puede justificase delante de dios por sus obras que se realizan por las fuerzas de su humana naturaleza o por la doctrina de la ley sin la gracia divina por cristo jes s sea anatema maldito
2628668 mas el consolador el espiritu santo a quien el padre enviara en mi nombre
2628669 gozo habra en el cielo por un solo pecador que se arrepiente
2628670 manda a todos los hombres de todo el mundo que se arrepientan
2628671 este jesus que les han llevado volver de la misma manera que ustedes lo han visto ir al cielo
2628672 con respecto a las preguntas que usted dijo todas estan basadas sobre una malacomprension y conocimiento del catolicismo por parte de ustedes
2628673 el sagrado concilio manda que adem s las im genes de cristo de la virgen madre de dios y de los santos se conserven principalmente en los templos y se les tribute el debido honor y veneraci n no porque se crea que en ella resida alguna divinidad o poder por lo cual deba d rseles culto o que a ellas haya que pedirles algo como hac an antiguamente los paganos que pon an su esperanza en los dolos sino porque el honor que a ellas se les rinde se refiere a las personas que a ellas representan de tal modo que las im genes que besamos ante las cuales nos descubrimos la cabeza y nos inclinamos es a cristo a quien adoramos y a los santos veneramos cuya representaci n tienen en ellas
2628674 el que tiene esposa y sirve esta dividido y el que no puede dedicarse mas a dios
2628675 si es cosa de hombres no prosperara pero si es de dios no sea que estemos luchando contra dios
2628676 me limitare a defender a jesucristo y su doctrina de el se or miranda
2628677 ya que su sacrificio en la cruz bast para justificarme santificarme librarme del pecado yo ya no tengo que hacer nada simplemente honrar ese sacrificio confesando el nuevo pacto por medio del evangelio de la incircunsici n
2628678 la muralla de la ciudad tenia doce fundamentos y en ellos el nombre de los doce apostoles del cordero
2628679 en cambio la jerusalen de arriba es libre y es nuetra madre
2628680 ve porque este hombre es un instrumento elegido por mi para llevar mi nombre a los gentiles a los reyes y al pueblo de israel
2628681 vieron que me habia sido confiada la predicacion del evangelio a los gentiles como a pedro para el apostolado a los judios porque el que obr por pedro para el apostolado de los judios obr tambien por mi en favor de los gentiles
2628682 al contrario vieron que me habia sido confiada la predicacion del evangelio a los gentiles como a pedro la predicacion a los judios
2628683 despues de mucha discusion se le vant pedro y dijo hermanos vosotros sabeis que hace algun tiempo dios me eligio para que los gentiles oyesen de mi boca la palabra del evangelio y creyesen
2628684 proclamaba reencarnaci n de cristo tambi n de lennin entre otros de hecho los miembros del templo entregaban todas sus pertenencias y bienes al ingresar y en teor a estaban colectivizados lo normal en estos casos es que se queden en manos del lider
2628685 jes s es el mismo yaer hoy y por los siglos
2628686 y por todos muri para que los que viven ya no vivan para s sino para aquel que muri y resucit por ellos
2628687 hola bendecidos para seguir con este tema necesito saber quien es jesus de nazareth para ustedes porque sin esa aclaraci n no podr amos seguir conversando pero me la contestan luego
2628688 gonzalo te recuerdo que jesus de nazareth era un simple cuerpo mortal con debilidades como todo ser humano pero el esp ritu que habitaba en el era el de dios mismo ahora jesus de nazareth no se le apareci a pablo recuerda que ese cuerpo ya muri y el que se le aparece es jesucristo esp ritu o sea dios mismo por lo tanto pablo nunca conoci a jesus de nazareth
2628689 y cuando ellos estaban aun contando estas cosas jes s mismo se puso entre ellos y les dijo
2628690 mirad mis manos y mis pies que soy yo mismo p a l p a d y ved q u e u n e s p i r i t u n o t i e n e c a r n e n i h u e s o s c o m o v e i s q u e y o t e n go
2628691 galatas 1 11 mas os hago saber hermanos que el evangelio anunciado por mi no es segun hombre
2628692 con respecto a los habladores de mentiras y enga adores yo no lo estoy diciendo lo dice pablo revisa bien el verso no lo digo yo en lo que respecta a los dos evangelios lee ah mismo en galatas 1 6 estoy maravillado de que tan pronto os hayais alejado del que os llamo por la gracia de cristo para seguir un evangelio diferente galatas 1 7 no que haya otro sino que hay algunos que os perturban y quieren pervertir el evangelio de cristo galatas 1 8 mas si aun nosotros o un angel del cielo os anunciare otro evangelio diferente del que os hemos anunciado sea anatema
2628693 1 7 no que haya otro sino que hay algunos que os perturban y quieren pervertir el evangelio de cristo
2628694 no se te hace parecido a los enga adores y habladores de mentiras o sea los de la circunsici n ahora leamos con la biblia cat lica
2628695 claudio en efesios 2 20 te olvidaste de algo siendo la principal piedra del angulo jesucristo mismo el mismo jesucristo que le revel a pablo su evangelio el evangelio de gracia el evangelio eterno por favor no nos subestimen al tratarnos de ignorantes mas bien tratennnos como locos conste que yo no eh hecho ninguna conjetura y tu mismo te respondes en los versos que me escribiste con respecto a que pablo no conoci a jesus de nazareth mis diezmos los angeles me han sabido multiplicar y no solo el dinero sino la salud el amor excelente esposa excelentes amistades ese diezmo es ganancia para mi malaquias 3 8 robara el hombre a dios pues vosotros me habeis robado y dijisteis en que me habeis robado en vuestros diezmos y ofrendas malaquias 3 9 malditos sois con maldicion porque vosotros la nacion toda me habeis robado malaquias 3 10 traed los diezmos al alfoli y haya alimento en mi casa y probadme ahora en esto dice el se or si no os abrire las ventanas de los cielos y derramare sobre vosotros bendicion hasta que sobreabunde ahora yo te pregunto tu le robas a dios gonzalo dale una leida a galatas 2 7 en cualquier otra biblioa excepto la catolica y veras los dos evangelios bendecidos con toda bendicion reciban sin limite
2628696 yahv h nuestro dios hizo pacto con nosotros en horeb no con nuestros padres hizo yahveh este pacto sino con nosotros todos los que estamos aqu hoy vivos
2628697 pero esto digo el que siembra escasamente escasamente cosechara y el que siembra generosamente generosamente cosechara como puedo sembrar
2628698 entonces tienes los ojos puestos en un judio gonzalo insisto pablo no conoci a jesus de nazareth porque a el se le apareci camino a damasco 30 a os despues de la muerte y resurrecci n de jesus acaso vivi m s tiempo jesus
2628699 un espiritu no tiene carrne ni huesos como ven que yo tengo
2628700 mujer por qu est s llorando a qui n est s buscando
2628701 se or si t lo has llevado lejos dime a ad nde lo ha puesto y lo sacar
2628702 si no viere en sus manos la se al de los clavos y metiere mi dedo en el lugar de los clavos y metiere mi mano en su costado no creer
2628703 por aqu tu dedo y mira mis manos y acerca tu mano y m tela en mi costado y no seas incr dulo sino creyente
2628704 lo que hemos o do lo que hemos visto con nuestros ojos lo que hemos contemplado y palparon nuestras manos tocante al verbo de vida
2628705 acerca de su hijo nuestro se or jesucristo que era del linaje de david seg n la carne que fue declarado hijo de dios por la resurrecci n de entre los muertos
2628706 me quieres decir que cristo subi al cielo en un cuerpo f sico
2628707 qu se juzga entre vosotros cosa increible que dios resucite a los muertos
2628708 y los muertos en cristo resucitar n primero luego nosotros los que vivimos los que hayamos quedado seremos arrebatados juntamente con ellos en las nubes para recibir al se or en el aire
2628709 c mo pueden los cuerpos f sicos de cristianos ser alzados en el aire
2628710 esperamos al salvador al se or jesucristo el cual transformar el cuerpo de la humillaci n nuestra para que sea semejante al cuerpo de la gloria suya
2628711 hay un solo cuerpo y un solo espiritu como tambien fuisteis llamados a una misma esperanza de vuestra vocacion un solo se or una sola fe un solo bautismo un dios y padre de todos
2628712 por tanto hermanos siendo que tenemos plena seguridad para entrar en el santuario por la sangre de jesus
2628713 por el nuevo y vivo camino que l nos abri a traves del velo esto es su carne
2628714 entonces el velo del templo se rasg en dos desde arriba hacia abajo
2628715 bendito el que viene en el nombre del se or
2628716 ninguna palabra torpe o corrompida salga de vuestra boca sino la necesaria para edificaci n de lo oyentes
2628717 no err is ni los borrachos heredar n el reino de dios
2628718 honroso es el matrimonio y el lecho sin mancilla pero a los fornicarios y ad lteros los juzgar dios
2628719 no am is al mundo ni las cosas que est n en el mundo si alguno ama al mundo el amor del padre no est en el
2628720 la ra z de todos los males es el amor al dinero
2628721 aprended de mi que soy manso y humilde de coraz n
2628722 t que dec as en tu coraz n subir a lo alto y sobre loa alturas subir y ser semejante al alt simo pero tu derribado eres y hasta el sehol
2628723 descendi al sepulcro tu soberbia gusanos ser n tu cama y gusanos te comer n
2628724 el que se enojare locamente contra su hermano ya es culpable de juicio
2628725 en cuanto dependa de vosotros estad en paz con todos los hombres
2628726 evangelio poder de dios para salvacion a todo aquel que cree pablo escribe en su evangelio que estamos perfectos somos salvos estamos sanos somo ricos
2628727 por eso aunque antes dios pas por alto los tiempos de la ignorancia en este tiempo manda a todos los hombres en todos los lugares que se arrepientan
2628728 pero desecha las cuestiones necias e insensatas sabiendo que engendran contiendas porque el siervo del se or no debe ser contencioso sino amable para con todos apto para ense ar sufrido que con mansedumbre corrija a los que se oponen por si quiza dios les conceda que se arrepientan para conocer la verdad y escapen del lazo del diablo en que est n cautivos a voluntad de l
2628729 cualquiera que se extrav a y no persevera en la doctrina de cristo no tiene a dios el que persevera en la doctrina de cristo se si tiene al padre y al hijo si alguno viene a vosotros y no trae esta doctrina no lo recibais en casa ni le digais bienvenido porque el que dice bienvenido participa en sus malas obras
2628730 no reine pues el pecado en vuestro cuerpo mortal de modo que lo obedezc is en sus concupiscencias
2628731 el que no amare al se or jesucristo sea anatema maranatha
2628732 el que no amare al se or jesucristo sea anatema el se or viene
2628733 la primera parte que finaliza en n significa se or en cuanto a la segunda parte los padres la consideraban como un tiempo pret rito ha venido los modernos expositores la toman como equivalente a un presente viene o futuro vendr ciertos eruditos en arameo consideran que la ltima parte consiste en tha e interpretan la frase como una exclamaci n ven nuestro se or o oh ven se or sin embargo el car cter del contexto indica que el ap stol est haciendo una declaraci n en lugar de expresar un deseo o de pronunciar una oraci n
2628734 en cuanto a la raz n de por qu se usaba esta expresi n lo m s probable es que fuera una expresi n corriente entre los cristianos primitivos que inclu a la consumaci n de sus deseos al principio el t tulo marana o maran utilizado al dirigirse a cristo y al referirse a l no era otra cosa que la respetuosa designaci n del maestro por parte de los disc pulos
2628735 numerous health safety and societal problems including reducing property values in affected neighborhoods and encouraging unsafe sex and aggressive attitudes toward women
2628736 they were telling lies about the industry that people were committing suicide and that drugs were rampant on the set
2628737 of course we had people from the set there to testify that those things are not happening
2628738 not intended as a prohibition of legally protected forms of expression
2628739 the only reason certain hos are popular is for what goes in their mouths not what comes out of them
2628740 die taschen erlauben es den laptop r ntgen zu lassen ohne dass er aus der tasche genommen werden mu sie sollen die wartezeiten f r die j hrlich ber 250 millionen us flugpassagiere verk rzen
2628741 nunca respondas al necio de acuerdo con su necedad para que no seas t tambi n como l
2628742 pero evita las cuestiones necias y genealog as y contenciones y discusiones acerca de la ley porque son vanas y sin provecho
2628743 pero desecha las cuestiones necias e insensatas sabiendo que engendran contiendas porque el siervo del se or no debe ser contencioso sino amable para con todos apto para ense ar sufrido que con mansedumbre corrija a los que se oponen por si quiz dios les conceda que se arrepientan para conocer la verdad y escapen del lazo del diablo en que est n cautivos a voluntad de l
2628744 sea vuestra palabra siempre con gracia sazonada con sal para que sep is c mo deb is responder a cada uno
2628745 pero ira y enojo a los que son contenciosos y no obedecen a la verdad sino que obedecen a la injusticia
2628746 con todo eso si alguno quiere ser contencioso nosotros no tenemos tal costumbre ni las iglesias de dios
2628747 el amor todo lo sufre todo lo cree todo lo espera todo lo soporta
2628748 los testigos de jehova ense an una falsa doctrina por esto y esto y esto que la biblia dice
2628749 testigos de jehov herejes sectarios hijos del diablo tienen dos dioses uno grande y uno chiquito russel fue un mason blah blah etc etc
2628750 la verdad es como un le n no necesita ser defendida no hay mas que dejarla libre ella se defiende sola
2628751 pero yo os digo que de toda palabra ociosa que hablen los hombres de ella dar n cuenta en el d a del juicio
2628752 te encarezco delante de dios y del se or jesucristo que juzgar a los vivos y a los muertos en su manifestaci n y en su reino que prediques la palabra que instes a tiempo y fuera de tiempo redarguye reprende exhorta con toda paciencia y doctrina porque vendr tiempo cuando no sufrir n la sana doctrina sino que teniendo comez n de o r se amontonar n maestros conforme a sus propias concupiscencias y apartar n de la verdad el o do y se volver n a las f bulas pero t s sobrio en todo soporta las aflicciones haz obra de evangelista cumple tu ministerio
2628753 lo que hab is o do desde el principio permanezca en vosotros si lo que hab is o do desde el principio permanece en vosotros tambi n vosotros permanecer is en el hijo y en el padre
2628754 es necesario que el hijo del hombre sea entregado en manos de hombres pecadores y que sea crucificado y resucite al tercer d a
2628755 por cuanto todos pecaron y est n destituidos de la gloria de dios
2628756 sabemos que somos de dios cristianos y el mundo entero est bajo el maligno
2628757 y dar a luz un hijo y llamar s su nombre jes s porque l salvar a su pueblo de sus pecados
2628758 y casi todo es purificado seg n la ley con sangre y sin derramamiento de sangre no se hace remisi n perd n
2628759 pero si andamos en luz como l est en luz tenemos comuni n unos con otros y la sangre de jesucristo su hijo nos limpia de todo pecado
2628760 mas ahora que hab is sido libertados del pecado y hechos siervos de dios ten is por vuestro fruto la santificaci n y como fin la vida eterna porque la paga del pecado es muerte mas la d diva de dios es vida eterna en cristo jes s se or nuestro
2628761 reciban el esp ritu santo a quienes les perdonen los pecados les quedar n perdonados
2628762 no quiero que me recete nada porque ud est peor de enfermo que y
2628763 a un juez de justica decirle que no suelte a ese ladr n porque ud es peor de ladr n que el
2628764 la esperanza de salvaci n para los ni os que mueren sin ser bautizados
2628765 para aquellos ni os que no merecen el para so pero tampoco el infierno o el purgatorio
2628766 existen serias razones teol gicas para creer que los ni os que mueren sin ser bautizados se salvar n y disfrutar n de la visi n de dios
2628767 pero jes s dijo dejad a los ni os venir a m y no se lo impid is porque de los tales es el reino de los cielos
2628768 pedro les dijo arrepent os y baut cese cada uno de vosotros en el nombre de jesucristo para perd n de los pecados y recibir is el don del esp ritu santo
2628769 el alma que pecare esa morir el hijo no llevar el pecado del padre ni el padre llevar el pecado del hijo la justicia del justo ser sobre l y la impiedad del imp o ser sobre l
2628770 la justicia del justo ser sobre l y la impiedad del imp o ser sobre l
2628771 miren muchachos nos equivocamos historicamente se ha creido que existia pero ha sido un error lo sentimos
2628772 muchachos no se preocupen mas hemos revocado el limbo aqui se acaba la cosa vivamos tranquilos
2628773 tu eres pedro y sobre esta piedra edificare mi iglesia los poderes del infierno no prevaleceran contrea ella lo que ates en la tierra quedara atado en los cielos y lo que desates en la tierra quedra desatado en los cielos
2628774 y le presentaban ni os para que los tocase y los disc pulos reprend an a los que los presentaban vi ndolo jes s se indign y les dijo dejad a los ni os venir a m y no se lo impid is porque de los tales es el reino de dios de cierto os digo que el que no reciba el reino de dios como un ni o no entrar en l y tom ndolos en los brazos poniendo las manos sobre ellos los bendec a
2628775 por que de los tales es el reino de dios
2628776 cuando el se or hace referencia a que el reino de dios es de los ni os no est hablando de que los ni os son salvos sino de aquellos que son como ni os en su actitud
2628777 y le presentaban ni os para que los tocase y los disc pulos reprend an a los que los presentaban vi ndolo jes s se indign y les dijo dejad a los ni os venir a m y no se lo impid is porque de los tales es el reino de dios de cierto os digo que el que no reciba el reino de dios como un ni o no entrar en l y tom ndolos en los brazos poniendo las manos sobre ellos los bendec a
2628778 jos lu s de jes s miranda qui n es
2628779 acuerdate de tu creador en los dias de tu juventud
2628780 ya que cambiaron la verdad de dios por la mentira honrando y dando culto a las criaturas antes que al creador el cual es bendito por los siglos am n
2628781 porque escrito est vivo yo dice el se or que ante m se doblar toda rodilla y toda lengua confesar a dios
2628782 si alguno destruyere el templo de dios dios le destruir a l porque el templo de dios el cual sois vosotros santo es
2628783 no os un is en yugo desigual con los incr dulos porque qu compa erismo tiene la justicia con la injusticia y qu comuni n la luz con las tinieblas
2628784 y no particip is en las obras infructuosas de las tinieblas sino m s bien reprendedlas
2628785 porque hay un solo dios y un solo mediador entre dios y los hombres jesucristo hombre
2628786 porque por gracia algo que no merecemos sois salvos pormedio de lafe y esto no de vosotros pues es don de dios no por obra para que nadie se glorie
2628787 sino santificad al se or dios en vuestros corazones y estad siempre aparejados para responder con mansedumbre y reverencia cada uno que os demande raz n de la esperanza que hay en vosotros
2628788 debemos hacer una cuidadosa separaci n de lo que es literal y lo po tico
2628789 por tanto id y doctrinad todos los gentiles bautiz ndolos en el nombre del padre y del hijo y del esp ritu santo mateo 28 19
2628790 ninguno tenga en poco tu juventud sino s ejemplo de los creyentes
2628791 dios dice verdades a medias para sus hijos peque os e ignorantes
2628792 lo que es inexplicable de acuerdo a la logica humana
2628793 y ser predicado este evangelio del reino en todo el mundo para testimonio a todas las naciones y entonces vendr el fin
2628794 te encarezco delante de dios y del se or jesucristo que juzgar a los vivos y a los muertos en su manifestaci n y en su reino que prediques la palabra que instes a tiempo y fuera de tiempo redarguye reprende exhorta con toda paciencia y doctrina porque vendr tiempo cuando no sufrir n la sana doctrina sino que teniendo comez n de o r se amontonar n maestros conforme a sus propias concupiscencias y apartar n de la verdad el o do y se volver n a las f bulas pero t s sobrio en todo soporta las aflicciones haz obra de evangelista cumple tu ministerio
2628795 vendr n muchos en mi nombre diciendo yo soy el cristo y a muchos enga ar n y oir is de guerras y rumores de guerras mirad que no os turb is porque es necesario que todo esto acontezca pero a n no es el fin porque se levantar naci n contra naci n y reino contra reino y habr pestes y hambres y terremotos en diferentes lugares y todo esto ser principio de dolores
2628796 entonces habr se ales en el sol en la luna y en las estrellas y en la tierra angustia de las gentes confundidas a causa del bramido del mar y de las olas desfalleciendo los hombres por el temor y la expectaci n de las cosas que sobrevendr n en la tierra porque las potencias de los cielos ser n conmovidas
2628797 y toda isla huy y los montes no fueron hallados
2628798 el cuarto ngel derram su copa sobre el sol al cual fue dado quemar a los hombres con fuego y los hombres se quemaron con el gran calor y blasfemaron el nombre de dios que tiene poder sobre estas plagas y no se arrepintieron para darle gloria
2628799 mir y he aqu un caballo amarillo y el que lo montaba ten a por nombre muerte y el hades le segu a y le fue dada potestad sobre la cuarta parte de la tierra para matar con espada con hambre con mortandad y con las fieras de la tierra
2628800 y se airaron las naciones y tu ira ha venido y el tiempo de juzgar a los muertos y de dar el galard n a tus siervos los profetas a los santos y a los que temen tu nombre a los peque os y a los grandes y de destruir a los que destruyen la tierra
2628801 tiene la cara sucia y no tiene espejo no se da cuenta
2628802 te encarezco delante de dios y del se or jesucristo que juzgar a los vivos y a los muertos en su manifestaci n y en su reino
2628803 he aqu el origen y la causa de la contaminaci n del mundo y de toda la tierra
2628804 he aqu que jehov vacia la tierra y la desnuda y trastorna su faz y hace esparcir sus moradores y suceder as como al pueblo tambi n al sacerdote como al siervo as su amo como la criada as su ama como el que compra al que vende como al que presta al que toma prestado como al que da a logro as al que lo recibe la tierra ser enteramente vaciada y completamente saqueada porque jehov ha pronunciado esta palabra
2628805 el aborto el adulterio la fornicaci n el divorcio la union de homosexuales la idolatria la pedofilia la zoofilia y la necrofilia
2628806 el gran rey y se or jes s l christos nos profetiz se ales en el sol y en la luna y en las estrellas y en la tierra angustia de las gentes por la confusi n del sonido de la mar y de sus ondas
2628807 entonces habr se ales en el sol mega explosi nes solares martes 28 de octubre y martes 4 de noviembre del a o 2003 eclipse anular total de sol viernes 8 de abril del 2005 y en la luna eclipse total lunar domingo 24 de abril del a o 2005 y en las estrellas alineaci nes y o conjunci nes planetarias i viernes 5 de mayo del a o 2000 ii domingo 5 de mayo del a o 2002 iii jueves 5 de mayo del a o 2005 y luego en la tierra angustia de las gentes confundidas a causa del bramido del mar y de las olas a causa del sonido de la mar y de sus ondas grandes huracanes tornados tifones tormentas marejadas maremotos tsunami y olas gigantescas
2628808 y cuando estas cosas comenzaren hacerse mirad y levantad vuestras cabezas porque vuestra redenci n est cerca
2628809 mas los cielos que son ahora y la tierra son conservados por la misma palabra confusi n con fusi n guardados para el fuego en el d a del juicio y de la perdici n de los hombres impios
2628810 por que he aqu viene el d a ardiente como un horno y todos los soberbios y todos los que hacen maldad ser n estopa y aquel d a vendr y los abrasara ha dicho jehov de los ejercitos
2628811 m s a vosotros los que tem is mi nombre
2628812 y el septimo ang l toco la trompeta y fueron hechas grandes voces en el cielo que decian

2628934 id say 70 out of 100 athletes in the olympic village smoke
2628935 i played a great first shot then a perfect iron from 140 yards it bounced in the front of the green but the wind picked up just at that moment and it went down to the water then again i had tried to make a good shot but again a lot of backspin again to the water
2628936 i couldnt come back after that eight i made a double bogey at the 18th because i was mad
2628937 i was almost fighting for the lead in the tournament and suddenly i was trying to make the cut
2628938 it may be exhausting to play 36holes youre putting that much mental effort and everything into it its rough
2628939 we mowed all of the roughs wednesday and the plan was to look at it see how it was coping and growing
2628940 we considered cutting the rough again friday and we did in fact do so in the fairway landing areas last night

2628945 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2628946 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2628947 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2628948 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2628949 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2628950 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2628951 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2628952 should talk to the american people and talk to the world
2628953 i would be very direct with president putin that these actions will have consequences long term in terms of our relationship with russia and it is in violation of the norms of international conduct
2628954 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
2628955 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2628956 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds

2628967 heh so thats it well huh i guess i should go load the dishwasher now
2628968 the eternal boy scout was admitting a truth when he said that politicians only do what public opinion allows them i was quite touched by that perception the lockie i knew would have said that public opinion was just the fickle fart of the multitude so the nats have learned something after all from their nine years in the wilderness
2628969 beltway issues only intrigue political wankers and policy wonks people like the press gallery really
2628970 have more fans pulling air out of the case then pushing into the case
2628971 this is a treacherous and malicious accusation i am not guilty
2628972 the charge is meant to embarrass me and nothing else im not embarrassed
2628973 depends a lot on the stance of that politician if that politician is backed by jerry falwell and takes the family values route that gets pretty legitimate but i dont see us pot shotting extramarital affairs just because its juicy copy
2628974 we had way too many penalties on offense way too many turnovers dropped balls and missed reads we did some good things we had four touchdowns i think we had a lot of opportunities to capitalize that we missed for the most part i think the defense got the best of us today there were good and bad things that we saw today
2628975 we talked about it earlier today and after practice yesterday that we wanted to come out and fly around and have fun whether were in the right place or not we wanted to go out and cause some turnovers and thats what we did tonight
2628976 from what i saw i thought our defense played well
2628977 well have to see if we played technique really well but i think we flew around and had a lot of energy and enthusiasm and it looked like the defensive guys were having fun i liked the work that we got on special teams tonight i thought we got some good stuff done there were certainly not where we should be right now in order to go win but we are probably about where we should be for the first scrimmage
2628978 we did make some big plays on offense tonight which is nice but i wasnt pleased with our overall consistency what well be more concerned about is looking at each guy individually if you look at the offense at a whole i dont think we had a real good night but what will happen is well get back and look at the film and well have some more specific thoughts about individuals who have to step their game up a bit
2628979 from what i saw i thought our defense played well well have to see if we played technique really well but i think we flew around and had a lot of energy and enthusiasm and it looked like of defensive guys were having fun i liked the work that we got on special teams tonight i thought we got some good stuff done there were certainly not where we should be right now in order to go win but we are probably about where we should be for the first scrimmage
2628980 i didnt think we were real strong offensively so obviously im not expecting to see a lot of good things tonight i thought we dropped some balls that killed drives and at times we didnt protect that well we had some balls batted down and we put the ball on the ground a couple of times which you never like to see but i think the defense had a good night and i think thats what were going to see typically anything i see in the scrimmage i go watch the film sunday or monday morning and im wrong so i hesitate to be to critical right now i know we have to get better offensively and i think we will early on if any gets ahead its usually the defense
2628981 he will i need to get him to hang on to the football he made a great catch then dropped the ball but overall hes had a great august so far hes just really doing a nice job im happy for him because he ahs really worked hard not only in the winter time but also in the spring and he had a really good summer hes also got his weight down and hes running well and catching the ball blocking well and he knows his assignments hes fun right now hes doing a good job
2628982 its a little bit hard we dropped too many balls is evening and i think at times we didnt have the right protection and we didnt put the passes where they needed to be and at times we had balls that were right there and we didnt catch them so overall we were not very good i think the key for us and for every offense is to be consistent play in and play out and i think we did that tonight
2628983 no obviously not i like some of the things our defense tonight we did make some big plays tonight on offense tonight which is nice but i wasnt pleased with our overall consistency what well be more concerned about is looking at each kid individually if you look at the offense at a whole i dont think we had a real good night but what will happen is well get back and look at the film and well have some more specific thoughts about individuals who have to step their game up a bit
2628984 its the same thing offensively if you dont feel like you played well as a unit typically you are not dominating people up front now that doesnt mean they played terrible but we didnt have much consistency in the run game and that does involve the offensive line i also thought at times our quarterbacks got hit too much and we may get back and look at the film and see that the quarterbacks had enough time to throw and didnt get rid of the ball in time but i thought overall there was a lot of pushing and shoving going on not a lot of crisp play by the offensive line
2628985 we the offense looked a little rusty today we had way too many penalties on offense way too many turnovers dropped balls and missed reads we did some good things we had four touchdowns i think we had a lot of opportunities to capitalize on that we missed for the most part i think the defense got the best of us today there were good and bad things that we saw today
2628986 this is the time to get the kinks out you start installing as much as you can on offense as early as you can in the summer and through these scrimmages and through competition throughout the week you start to weed out the stuff that you dont like we saw some things tonight that we really liked on offense thats new we also saw some things that we thought was going to work out that we may have to hold off on i think some of the young guys stepped up and made some good plays overall it was just an average day for the offense what sticks in our mind is the turnovers and the three and outs
2628987 we flew around out there we talked about it earlier today and after practice yesterday that we wanted to come out and fly around and have fun whether were in the right place or not we wanted to go out and cause some turnovers and thats what we did tonight
2628988 going up against our offense everyday you can learn a lot of things one of the most vital things that we need to learn is what can hurt us depending on what defense we run coach lobo and the offensive staff are trying to put us in a bind and coach lambert and his staff are trying to put us in situations where we fly around and try to get out of it we have to learn to fight through adversity
2628989 go and boil your bottoms sons of a silly person i blow my nose at you

2629057 i think the list is eventually going to get everybody
2629058 the idea that no child left behind and adequate yearly progress are some magic accountability measure that people can easily look at to see which schools are doing well and which ones arent is just an absolute joke because every state has different measures and the bar keeps rising

2629146 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2629147 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2629148 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2629149 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2629150 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2629151 eh kak i let you watch something kak very exciting
2629152 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2629153 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2629154 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2629160 if we can solve a problem without violence why cant we just do that maybe it will take a longer time or maybe we have a lower chance of success but as long as we have even 1 of success rate why not go for it if you dont ask the answer is always no in this case if you dont try the result is always a failure
2629161 the major mechanism of evolution in any population where those individuals who are better adapted in a particular environment exhibit better reproductive success
2629162 until 1845 in england most peppered were light a few individuals were found to be dark with increasing industrialization smoke and soot polluted the environment making all the plants and rocks dark by the 1950s all moths in the industrialized regions were dark only a few light coloured individuals could be found before the industrial revolution white moths were camouflaged in their environment and dark moths were easy prey for predators after the environment was darkened by heavy pollution dark moths were camouflaged and had selective advantage within a relatively short time 100 years dark moths replaced the light moths in the population

2629169 already during the enlightenment free will was understood to be limited by external factors
2629170 other scientists stress that the decision making process includes a series of steps occurring on various levels the conscious decision should be understood as the final stage of a complex process a limitation on free will but not a contradiction
2629171 if a certain person with certain genes is put in a certain circumstance wouldnt he she always make the same choices each time he she finds him herself in this predicament
2629172 one cannot depend wholly on free will because one cannot choose who they are born to or how they are brought up as a child

2629186 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2629187 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2629188 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market

2629228 i dont think you can excuse defend explain or make allowance for russian behavior because of what is going on in georgia
2629229 thats kind of like saying after saddam hussein invaded kuwait that kuwait and iraq need to show restraint or like saying in 1968 when the soviet union invaded czechoslovakia that the czechoslovaks should show restraint
2629230 john mccain was there a month ago in this community and was asked a question about this dhl issue and did not say one word about his role in this or the role of his campaign manager that is the furthest thing from straight talk that we can imagine

2629257 russian planes dropped several bombs on a military airfield not far from tbilisi international airport
2629258 there were no planes there their task was to damage the runway
2629259 ive obviously got to shoot some pretty good numbers coming in and tear up the course
2629260 if i can get back to something like even par that will be nice but the whole course is a lot easier so i dont think youll see scores slipping down any more
2629261 after that i got mad and played not very concentrated the rest of the round
2629262 i couldnt come back after that eight because i was mad
2629263 i was fighting for the lead and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the rest of the round
2629264 i feel really confident going into the next three weeks
2629265 one thing weve really done over the years is rise to big games and special occasions and i think individually guys will be steeling themselves for this week
2629266 if we get up against geelong it would really set our season alight
2629267 if we can go into the one on one battles and win them individually even if we dont win but we play our style of footy it will really set us up for the last two rounds and hopefully some finals action
2629268 i was pretty happy with myself at halftime i had four goals in so i only needed one in the second half
2629269 i thought i played my role i was a bit lucky a few times when it got over the back
2629270 it gives us a bit of confidence to go in and take on a massive challenge next week
2629271 he is one of the best players that i have ever seen

2629278 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2629279 be happy to participate in one i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
2629280 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister
2629281 she is a good and honest person the sweetest and most caring woman one could ever hope to meet
2629282 do you think its easy for us to just sit back and let everyone rip her to shreds and not defend her honor
2629283 it could well be it looks like me i dont know who that baby is i have no idea what the picture is
2629284 i mean do you know how many pictures have been taken of me holding children in the last three years i mean it happens all the time
2629285 i think its amazing even as the mans coming clean that hes continuing to lie
2629286 just as ive been saying for 10 months that he had an affair with rielle hunter we know for a fact that is rielle hunters baby and that is him holding the baby in the beverly hilton hes not only hiding things from the public hes hiding things from his wife
2629287 we couldnt have been there at 3 in the morning if we didnt have a good pipeline into the whole situation
2629288 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2629289 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2629290 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2629291 we are trying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing
2629292 i see all the nations get together i am very upset about it i wish everybody would be at peace especially during the olympics
2629293 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2629294 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2629295 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that

2629301 all i was trying to do was the right thing
2629302 the agent said we are going to be watching him we cant be watching you
2629303 they are humans no matter what they do all i was trying to do was the right thing i was just trying to do my job
2629304 safeguards are now in place that we believe would prevent this from recurring
2629305 there are insufficient safeguards on the agencys use of national security letters and other intrusive surveillance tools there arent enough controls inside the agency and there arent enough checks from outside the agency
2629306 especially dangerous is the fbis power to impose gag orders on those ordered to disclose information
2629307 these gag orders which are often unnecessary and almost always overbroad invite abuse
2629308 i think the lesson lies to some degree elsewhere it lies in the method of the campaigning the style of the campaigning and the appeal to the electorate and i think we certainly need to look at the early election
2629309 there are lessons clearly but there needs to be a great deal of thought into what those lessons mean

2629345 far and away the best opportunity to obtain significant new substantial sustainable statewide and regional was first amended to eliminate the gas tax and then defeated essentially along party lines
2629346 acted like boys in a locker room snapping their towels while virginias economy strangled on traffic congestion

2629361 the last time we played here there was a riot
2629362 primarily employed persons who have illegally entered or are illegally present in the united states these persons are placed by olen staff co in work assignments with other companies
2629363 have facilitated concealed and derived substantial income from this employment of illegal aliens

2629374 it was time to give back to the society i had spend my early years as a child
2629375 solar technologies decrease our dependence on conventional fossil fuel based energy
2629376 through our core business and as a good neighbour we believe in making a positive social contribution in local communities we wanted to partner with the nef in its vision to support education in rural india and help us change the way people live
2629377 we are committed to creating world changing technologies and by developing and supporting solar energy we are collectively acting upon our belief
2629378 i noticed that in the four years i have been on the commission the same people attend and pretty much the same dont
2629379 i wanted to make sure out of the 11 people we could get a consistent 80 90 percent attendance rate so i worked with steve hollis on an idea that would not alienate people but would hold them accountable
2629380 we get a lot of different voices on the commission but when the same people show up and the same people dont you are losing a lot of input you can get a broad range of opinions but when certain people dont show up it is hard to get a sense of direction it hurt our ability to get stuff done and makes things more complicated
2629381 you re invent the wheel when members dont know what we have done in the past
2629382 the lying treasonous msm ltmsm didnt cut vito fossella of staten island ny any slack thats because he has an r after his name he basically did the same thing had an affair fathered a child as edwards only difference is he resigned
2629383 i very rarely have to wait long for a story to run
2629384 if its an investigation occasionally as long as a week
2629385 the real deal it referred to a homicide detainees had been killed in custody i mean you cant get much clearer than that
2629386 i pitched it i dont know four times at page one meetings with increasing urgency and frustration i laid awake at night over this story and i dont fully understand to this day what happened my single greatest frustration as foreign editor was my inability to get that story on page one
2629387 insisted that it was improbable it was just hard to get their mind sic around
2629388 if it had run on the front page it would have sent a strong signal not just to the bush administration but to other news organizations
2629389 theories of what drove the neanderthals to extinction range from an inability to adapt to a quickly changing environment to genocide by early humans
2629390 professor chris stringer head of human origins at the natural history museum in london believes that the long period of separation and genetic isolation between the neanderthals and early modern humans meant that profound physical and mental differences had evolved between them
2629391 we simply dont know the answer and the answer may have varied from one time and place to another especially given the vagaries of human behaviour
2629392 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2629393 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2629394 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2629395 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2629396 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2629397 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2629398 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2629399 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2629400 i pulled the chain and then i took a photo of it
2629401 t he alternative for japan is prompt and utter destruction
2629402 if the united stated states had taken an active part in the league of nations and if the league of nations had been prepared to use concerted force even had it only been european force to prevent the re armament of germany there was no need for further serious bloodshed if the allies had resisted hitler strongly in his early stages even up to his seizure of the rhineland in 1936 he would have been forced to recoil and a chance would have been given to the sane elements in german life which were very powerful especially in the high command to free germany of the maniacal government and system into the grip of which she was falling
2629403 i voiced to him my grave misgivings first on the basis of my belief that japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary and secondly because i thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was i thought no longer mandatory as a measure to save american lives it was my belief that japan was at that very moment seeking some way to surrender with a minimum loss of face the secretary was deeply perturbed by my attitude
2629404 i told macarthur of my memorandum of mid may 1945 to truman that peace could be had with japan by which our major objectives would be accomplished macarthur said that was correct and that we would have avoided all of the losses the atomic bomb and the entry of russia into manchuria
2629405 the potsdam declaration in july demand ed that japan surrender unconditionally or face prompt and utter destruction macarthur was appalled he knew that the japanese would never renounce their emperor and that without him an orderly transition to peace would be impossible anyhow because his people would never submit to allied occupation unless he ordered it ironically when the surrender did come it was conditional and the condition was a continuation of the imperial reign had the generals advice been followed the resort to atomic weapons at hiroshima and nagasaki might have been unnecessary
2629406 there are nearly 600 000 eligible but unregistered black voters across the state

2629502 the backstroke took a lot out of me but i did my best i cant ask for anything more
2629503 we knew what the first act was but what do they do when theyre out there in the jungle
2629504 hes going to call me up and say i want to do a great big movie with you but i want you to have the highest risk factor
2629505 it had to be clear what we are satirizing is the character and his loss of identity so we have a black actor there
2629506 calling lazarus on every moment to be perfectly clear about our point of view we never wanted it to be ok
2629507 but i put myself out there ive had flops there is stuff i do that could easily become parody too again it always comes back to what we are satirizing the actors and the hollywood system what do you do to be taken seriously how far do you go
2629508 for the 14 3 million americans with cognitive disabilities and their families such arguments may be problematic these people share a history of segregation and exclusion and report that what many call the r word reinforces negative social attitudes just as racial ethnic and sexually oriented slurs do
2629509 in its first four days its had 1 8 million hits that shows that the community is very interested in the information it can provide
2629510 the liberal party wanders around saying its all a waste of time presumably they would abolish it presumably they believe in less information for consumers
2629511 but consumers recognise that in a competitive market the more information they can have the better and we agree and were determined to give them that information
2629512 we said before the election the biggest impact on grocery prices was international factors we said before the election the biggest henpeck on petrol prices was world oil prices and that continues to be the case
2629513 the now prime minister and now treasurer were asked can you guarantee to bring prices down they said before the election no but we will do whatever we can to put more competitive pressure in to the market

2629519 in a hydropicall body ten years buried in a church yard we met with a fat concretion where the nitre of the earth and the salt and lixivious liquor of the body had coagulated large lumps of fat into the consistence of the hardest castle soap wherof part remaineth with us

2629522 its obviously a bit late for the government to worry about what has become a monstrous mockery of thousands of colombian victims they should have thought about that before abruptly agreeing to the extradition of criminals with such terrifying histories
2629523 gringo judges consider fighting domestic drug consumption more important than penalizing those responsible for distant massacres
2629524 after undergoing approximately eight hours of surgery yesterday afternoon and evening she is in a critical but stable condition at a beijing hospital
2629525 just everywhere out here laid out on the ground they are bloody
2629526 we thought it would be better for him to get on the bus because its a far drive
2629527 now he keeps saying that he should have driven himself
2629528 madeleine came here for lunch with her parents not long before she disappeared
2629529 i dont know if this guy took a picture of madeleine its impossible to say but he took a lot of photographs on the beach
2629530 the police said they had had complaints about a man acting strangely on the beaches they thought he might have been a watcher a voyeur they told me to get in touch if i saw him again but i never saw him after that
2629531 they came a lot but i only saw the mccann family here once
2629532 i saw the little blemish in her right eye she really stood out she was the absolute image of the missing madeleine
2629533 i was afraid to do anything i decided to get a good look to make sure it was her so i could report it
2629534 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2629535 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2629536 hamas has agreed to close the file of political detentions and fatah showed its readiness too but there were no measures of datesset for doing so
2629537 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2629538 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2629539 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2629540 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2629541 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2629542 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2629543 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c

2629545 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2629546 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2629547 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2629548 if you dont want to know the results yet please mute your tv now
2629549 we must know that you will follow our instructions no matter what the circumstances inside the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair kill her
2629550 you cant be serious i could never shoot my wife
2629551 then youre not the right man for this job take your wife and go home
2629552 you dont have what it takes take your wife home
2629553 i had to beat him to death with the chair
2629554 there are a few things we need to fix and we need to do it quickly and move on
2629555 we spoke to the players about it after the game and you the media will talk about it and it is going to be thrown up and that is finals as an agenda
2629556 but its about improving our football and getting going once again
2629557 clearly the west coast game was poor the port game we won in a lot of areas but our forward efficiency was poor and then against collingwood we were slow out of the blocks
2629558 but we know we are better than that and our aim is to try and keep improving and we felt we had done that but clearly we have faltered a little bit
2629559 it felt great for us as a team to move the ball that way
2629560 we continued to keep fighting and we persevered through all of those penalties and i think that it shows the character and focus of this team
2629561 we had a couple of missed formations a couple of forced passes a couple of inaccurate throws but thats going to happen in a preseason game thats why were playing these games we want to work those kinks out
2629562 we just have to get used to game speed game tackling and just get honed in
2629563 i think we did a pretty good job everybody was hustling we have a couple of big hits out there but all around we are just trying to get a feel for the game again
2629564 he threw the ball away which is one of those situations that we talked about
2629565 he made a couple nice throws there on some back shoulder throws
2629566 i think we did well we moved the ball well
2629567 we were slow a little early they did some good things on defense we got it going after a series or two we had a couple good drives but we just have to finish
2629568 weve got to do a little better job of getting the defense off the field right now
2629569 let me thank you and congratulate you for bringing the worlds most memorable olympics
2629570 first impressions are always powerful in this case not only was china my first apec asia pacific economic cooperation summit but china was also one of the first to congratulate me when i was sworn in as president of the philippines in 2001 today philippine chinese relations are at an all time high
2629571 mike defensor is in the private sector now as a private citizen he can conduct his own business ano ba naman tayo why dont we want people to succeed
2629572 we are just going to say that our hearts go out to her and her family
2629573 tang has no criminal record his neighbors said they hadnt seen any abnormal behavior from him before left hangzhou
2629574 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2629575 most ambitious olympics in history opens with most spectacular show
2629576 my father is always at his work to this very day and i too am working i tell you the truth the son can do nothing by himself he can do only what he sees his father doing because whatever the father does the son also does for the father loves the son and shows him all he does yes to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these
2629577 oh yeah i guess i havent really been doing anything against god but i havent exactly been doing anything for him either
2629578 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2629579 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2629580 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2629581 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2629582 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2629583 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2629584 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2629585 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2629586 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2629587 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2629588 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2629589 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2629590 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2629591 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2629592 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2629593 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2629594 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2629595 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2629596 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2629597 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2629598 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2629599 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2629600 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2629601 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2629602 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2629603 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2629604 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2629605 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2629606 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2629607 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2629608 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2629609 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2629610 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2629611 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2629612 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2629613 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2629614 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2629615 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2629616 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2629617 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2629618 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2629619 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2629620 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2629621 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2629622 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2629623 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2629624 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2629625 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2629626 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2629627 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2629628 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2629629 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2629630 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2629631 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2629632 just so you all know we did set a record
2629633 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2629634 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2629635 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2629636 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2629637 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2629638 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2629639 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2629640 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2629641 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2629642 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2629643 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2629644 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2629645 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2629646 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2629647 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2629648 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2629649 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2629650 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2629651 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2629652 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2629653 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2629654 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2629655 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2629656 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2629657 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2629658 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2629659 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2629660 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2629661 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2629662 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2629663 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2629664 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2629665 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2629666 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2629667 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2629668 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2629669 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2629670 consequence of economic growth and development untendered by adequate concern and conservation
2629671 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2629672 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2629673 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2629674 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2629675 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2629676 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2629677 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2629678 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2629679 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2629680 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2629681 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2629682 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2629683 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2629684 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
2629685 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
2629686 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
2629687 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2629688 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2629689 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2629690 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2629691 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
2629692 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2629693 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2629694 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2629695 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2629696 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2629697 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2629698 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2629699 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2629700 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2629701 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2629702 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2629703 it predates me being involved in politics or him being involved in politics im older than him so i serve an older brother role i hope he feels ive been there for him and hes certainly been a very loyal and terrifically helpful colleague
2629704 one of the roles ive always wound up playing is being a translator telling people yes he has a different approach hes serious about change this is what it means and my relationship with him gives credibility to that
2629705 my dad is one of the people who taught me how to laugh
2629706 the group had sort of a smothers brothers like routine they would sing songs and they would tell topical stories talk about current events tell a few jokes sing songs and you know thats my dads personality
2629707 i ended up delivering packages to these glittering buildings in downtown chicago and when youre a kid growing up in chicago these are the most important buildings in your life
2629708 in a permanent state of zen very even handed very mild mannered
2629709 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2629710 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2629711 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2629712 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2629713 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2629714 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2629715 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2629716 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2629717 real results by the end of my first term in office
2629718 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2629719 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2629720 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
2629721 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
2629722 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
2629723 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2629724 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
2629725 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
2629726 right kind rooted in the real lives of real people
2629727 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2629728 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2629729 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2629730 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2629731 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2629732 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2629733 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2629734 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2629735 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2629736 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2629737 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2629738 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2629739 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2629740 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2629741 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2629742 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2629743 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2629744 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
2629745 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
2629746 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
2629747 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2629748 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2629749 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2629750 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2629751 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2629752 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2629753 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2629754 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2629755 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2629756 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2629757 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2629758 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2629759 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2629760 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2629761 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2629762 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2629763 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
2629764 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
2629765 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
2629766 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2629767 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2629768 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2629769 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2629770 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2629771 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
2629772 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
2629773 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2629774 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2629775 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
2629776 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
2629777 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2629778 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2629779 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2629780 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2629781 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2629782 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2629783 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2629784 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2629785 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2629786 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2629787 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2629788 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2629789 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2629790 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2629791 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2629792 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2629793 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2629794 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2629795 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2629796 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2629797 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2629798 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2629799 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2629800 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2629801 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2629802 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2629803 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2629804 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2629805 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2629806 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2629807 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2629808 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2629809 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2629810 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2629811 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2629812 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2629813 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2629814 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2629815 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2629816 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2629817 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2629818 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2629819 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2629820 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2629821 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2629822 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2629823 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2629824 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2629825 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2629826 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2629827 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2629828 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2629829 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2629830 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2629831 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2629832 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2629833 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2629834 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2629835 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere

2629842 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2629843 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2629844 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2629845 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2629846 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2629847 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2629848 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2629849 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2629850 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2629851 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2629852 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2629853 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2629854 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2629855 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2629856 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2629857 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2629858 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2629859 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

2629872 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
2629873 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil

2629912 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2629913 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2629914 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2629915 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
