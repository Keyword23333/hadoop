5460007 we made up a plan that we were going to tell the cops that nobody kicked him that there were no racial slurs there was no booze and brian got hit first

5460011 night cream designed to reduce crows feet worth the cost
5460012 im very happy to have curt back as he is one of the leagues top players
5460013 curt is a finesse player who has a strong connection with calgary captain tracey kelusky they balance well off of each other they are both finishers good goal scorers and both have great intelligent lacrosse minds
5460014 he is an offensive leftie and rookie of the year in the wla
5460015 he is probably the most sought after player in our league right now for upcoming offensive talent
5460016 its nice to welcome john lintz aboard he had a great season in the summer playing for langley
5460017 were going to have a huge battle for lefties on our team and we welcome john to that opportunity to compete for a position with the calgary roughnecks
5460018 we dont do this but it happened ill fix it and im sorry
5460019 so if you can get the same payoff from sitting around watching the olympics why wouldnt you
5460020 i dont want a job i dont want to work
5460021 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5460022 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5460023 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5460024 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5460025 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5460026 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5460027 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5460028 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5460029 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5460030 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5460031 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5460032 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5460033 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5460034 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5460035 se i vostri sentimenti fossero cambiati devo dirvelo mi avete stregato anima e corpo e vi amo vi amo vi amo e dora in avanti non voglio pi separarmi da voi
5460036 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5460037 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5460038 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5460039 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5460040 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5460041 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5460042 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5460043 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5460044 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5460045 we are serious there is a red line the red line is the withdrawal of the troops they must withdraw the troops
5460046 it seems to me and i may be completely mistaken that we will see this beginning of a troop withdrawal today and in the night
5460047 at a given moment we will be faced with ultimatums
5460048 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5460049 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5460050 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5460051 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5460052 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5460053 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5460054 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5460055 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5460056 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5460057 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5460058 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5460059 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5460060 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5460061 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5460062 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5460063 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5460064 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5460065 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5460066 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5460067 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5460068 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5460069 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5460070 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5460071 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5460072 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5460073 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5460074 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5460075 cable boxes that can access the internet flat panel computer monitors and certain computer printers that can also scan fax and or copy
5460076 the eu committed to bind and eliminate duties on ita products in its wto tariff schedules we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5460077 however the eu claims it can now charge duties on these products simply because they incorporate technologies or features that did not exist when the ita was concluded
5460078 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued technological development in the information technology industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers
5460079 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5460080 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5460081 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5460082 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5460083 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5460084 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5460085 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5460086 i think this was done by some stupid kids who dont know how to use their brain
5460087 helping people take control of their health is one of our primary goals at aetna so you ll find much of what was funded directed toward that end
5460088 we are very excited about strengthening our position in northern california by teaming up with an established local market leader that shares our values and is completely dedicated to the growth of solar energy
5460089 ies is a good example of leveraging our existing infrastructure with strategic acquisitions of companies that have an established loyal customer base a good cultural fit compatible geography and realizable synergies
5460090 as the founder of independent energy systems it has always been of paramount importance to me that we install high quality well designed systems and ensure our customers are pleased with our finished product
5460091 real goods is the original solar company has a powerful brand and a philosophy that is very compatible with ies all key factors in our decision to team up with john and his team i am pleased that ies will continue to be a local company intimately connected with the santa cruz community with new skills bolstered by real goods 30 year history
5460092 we are very pleased with our success for the recently concluded fiscal year resulting in strong increases in both net income and sales order backlog our record sales order backlog at august 18 2008 47 2 million reflects that our company is well positioned for the future
5460093 the talent and commitment of our senior management team continues to drive clear channel radio s industry leadership and success
5460094 these individuals are key members of our executive management team and have helped build our audiences while turning competing technologies into collaborators they will continue to push our outstanding content deeper into our current digital platforms as well as new ones
5460095 these individuals along with our full management team are helping to change the face of radio
5460096 these promotions and contract extensions reflect the hard work dedication and enthusiasm that make the clear channel radio team the strongest and most innovative group in radio
5460097 nansulate has been specified into the main cooling and heating system for this design nansulate added to the mattress cover system was found to reduce cooling temperature at a rate of 1 8 degrees per minute as compared to the foam insulation alone which reduced temperature at a rate of 1 1 degrees per minute all tests were performed under identical conditions cooling one gallon of fluid by speeding up the cooling process substantial energy savings were achieved in addition nansulate prevented sweating during the cooling process and also prevents growth of unwanted substances on the surface of the system
5460098 the same carefully researched cooling and heating system specifying nansulate will be incorporated into a new machine to form x ray invisible casts with perfectly even pressure over the entire area of a broken limb the casts can be worn while swimming or bathing and re formed again with perfectly even pressure when swelling reduces due to nansulate the time to form a perfectly even pressure cast will be approximately three minutes additionally nansulate is being specified in the heating and cooling system for a unique portable machine to heat and or cool with adjustable massage any area of the body for sports medicine and general physiotherapy needs this machine will free up the doctor or technician to perform other tasks the portability of the battery operated machine is due in large part to the energy savings realized with nansulate insulating coatings
5460099 the incorporation of our nansulate coating into these medical devices represents a brand new market segment opportunity edward moore design is an expert in their field and we look forward to our technology offering unique benefits to their company for this medical equipment and other designs energy savings is something that is important to every industry and we are pleased to offer a solution that can be used in a variety of diverse applications

5460102 investors have been trying to put the housing and credit crisis behind them they want to believe were in the eighth or ninth inning but every time news like this comes up they have to readjust their thinking
5460103 we are still in the throes of the credit crisis

5460107 i called and spoke to russian diplomat yuri popov and he said he could not get to the office because his car had a flat tyre
5460108 this was preposterous i said the delegation must have more cars he said there is another car but its tyre is flat too at this point i knew it was a trap and i was very angry
5460109 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
5460110 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
5460111 it really makes little sense to try to upgrade our infrastructure using a revenue source as ineffective unsustainable and unpopular as the fuel tax
5460112 secretary peters plan to overhaul our nations transportation investment strategy begins the much needed transition away from status quo solutions that produce status quo results her plan strengthens the abilities of state and local officials to integrate effective transit and highway solutions to meet americans ever changing travel demands
5460113 most pr folks dont read blogs and certainly dont understand them
5460114 dont feel guilty the only people who should feel guilty are those who dont do anything to change the world and just accept it the way it is youre vegetarian thats something
5460115 i dont really get why bitchy jones is the de facto standard of what a dominant woman is she is just one person writing about fucking her stable why not just live and let live
5460116 her ranting style detracts from any serious points that she may be trying to make it all sounds like sour grapes to me
5460117 it is rather frustrating when she is being discussed on tv as having such an influential and well read blog and yet has such narrow minded opinions
5460118 i do not think that bj is a dominant i do not think that bj is a woman and it really does not matter to me whatever bjs blog might have been worth has disappeared over the term of the blog it has devolved the same way that the news media has it is all about attention and shock bj is just another sanctimonious attention whore
5460119 im not particularly impressed by anything shes written but to each their own im sure there are guys wanking to it at this moment
5460120 personally i find bitchy jones more annoying than elise sutton
5460121 i could have agreed with and even sympathized with bitchy jones had she just refrained from the cheap shots and the insinuations that attractive pro dommes are fake undominant money grubbing bimbos
5460122 her rants about the word domme strap ons and feminization are just annoying
5460123 the profanity while plenty gratuitous lacks any sense of appreciation for the art
5460124 im not up in her business telling her shes not a real dominant because shes not hot so why is she trying to say that people like me who are attractive pro dommes are just a male manufactured joke
5460125 ill shut this damn thread down if this stupid bitchy jones shit gets started again lol the name alone screams koo koo

5460127 five points will be huge especially coming into the harder games towards the end of the season so we need to get as many as we can in this early part of the season to put us in good stead
5460128 i think if we look to get stuck into counties manukau in the set piece we can get on the front foot
5460129 i guess with the new rules there is a lot more pressure on the first five to make tackles and make decisions and so i think that will be an area where well look to attack
5460130 we played territory quite well obviously northland are no canterbury but our set piece went very well from the previous week and hopefully that builds confidence amongst the forwards
5460131 time in the saddle is all it is once youre actually in there and settled and playing week in week out you get more comfortable and get used to the standard
5460132 deep concerns about the news standards and level of objectivity
5460133 it might seem redundant to dismiss the fourth and final twilight novel as escapist fantasy but how else could anyone look at a romance about an ordinary even clumsy teenager torn between a vampire and a werewolf both of whom are willing to sacrifice their happiness for hers flaws and all however meyers first three novels touched on something powerful in their weird refraction of our cultures paradoxical messages about sex and sexuality the conclusion is much thinner despite its interminable length everygirl bella achieves her wishes quickly marriage and sex in that order are two and becoming an immortal is another and once she becomes a vampire its almost impossible to identify with her but thats not the main problem essentially everyone gets everything they want even if their desires necessitate an about face in characterization or the messy introduction of some back story nobody has to renounce anything or suffer more than temporarily in other words grandeur is out this isnt about happy endings its about gratification a sign of the times
5460134 other people are perpetrators new events are potential traumas relationships are too vulnerable and risky because of the potential for loss

5460143 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5460144 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5460145 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5460146 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5460147 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5460148 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5460149 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5460150 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5460151 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5460152 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5460153 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5460154 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5460155 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5460156 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5460157 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5460158 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5460159 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5460160 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5460161 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5460162 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5460163 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5460164 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5460165 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5460166 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5460167 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5460168 this is a planning took where all things are going
5460169 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5460170 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5460171 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5460172 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5460173 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5460174 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5460175 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5460176 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5460177 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5460178 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5460179 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5460180 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5460181 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

5460444 just like bush and cheney john gard is allowing big oil and other special interests to control his policy and manage his message
5460445 john gard has taken nearly 50 000 from oil and gas companies while running for congress and appears that the big oil money was well spent
5460446 if john gard is so concerned about gas prices why did he vote to raise the state gas tax and add to the burden on fuel costs for the citizens of wisconsin

5460606 last friday maura johnston discusses the impact that certain djs have had on their audiences she also shares how important college radio has been to her over the years and wonders if radio personalities today still have the same draw saying
5460607 as a high schooler who was slowly transitioning out of her hard rock fandom college radio djs were really important to me turning me on to bands like tiger trap lush and smashing orange but the transient nature of college radio and my own transition to the other side of the microphone resulted in the relationship being nowhere near as long standing as the ones that the other personalities ive mentioned here have enjoyed with their audiences is it even possible to have that sort of fan subject relationship with a dj anymore or has something else entirely filled that void thanks to the many problems terrestrial radio has had and the explosion of outlets that have taken on the mantle of bringing people music
5460608 i cant stress enough how important college radio was to me i discovered it literally by accident and it immediately opened up the possibility of a new world something that was quite mysterious at age 14 what made listening to wrsu and wprb so special was the djs the patented college radio monotone may be an easy target for ridicule but for me it was the voice of normal people not so different from me only a few years older who had access to great records i hadnt heard and were enthusiastic to share them i dont think i would have gotten so deep into music without them for better or worse

5460644 if comcast says to its customers okay you need to go over to ipv6 because were out of addresses and we want to add subscribers that will force the issue

5460648 celebrity yes ready to lead no obamas new taxes could break your family budget the press warns the taxman cometh obamas taxes mean higher prices at the pump obamas taxes a recipe for economic disaster higher taxes higher gas prices economic disaster thats the real obama
5460649 this terse ad is misleading because it targets a broad audience yet makes a key assertion obamas new taxes could break your family budget that at most applies only to a narrow group previous ads from the mccain campaign have straddled and at times crossed the line of accuracy in criticizing obamas policies this ad bases most of its charges on newspaper editorials thus by citing their opinions the spot shifts the burden of accuracy from the mccain campaign to others in an effort to appear more credible the new ad contains a major caveat when it says obamas new taxes could break the family budget that family under the obama plan would have to be earning 250 000 or more a year to see its taxes rise nearly all those watching the ad would fall outside that group the phrase taxman cometh appeared in a july 1 editorial in the wall street journal that decried obamas tax policies as presented in the mccain ad the charge of higher gasoline prices is ambiguous obama hasnt suggested raising the federal tax on gasoline the mccain campaign attributes the prospect of higher prices at the pump to analyses the one cited in the ad came from a washington post editorial published aug 6 that conclude that the costs of obamas proposed windfalls profit tax on the record earnings of oil companies would eventually be passed on to consumers that obamas plan is a recipe for disaster is the opinion of the las vegas review journal which criticized obama in an editorial published sept 20 2007 it said he sought to raise the tax rate on the top income bracket from 35 percent to 39 6 percent nearly double the tax rate on capital gains and dividends and eliminate all tax breaks for the gas and oil industries and private equity firm managers when the editorial appeared last fall it was unclear how much of an increase in the capital gains tax obama favored on thursday obamas economic advisers said the tax rate would increase to 20 percent not to nearly 30 percent and again only for those earning 250 000 or more the advisers also said obama would indeed seek rates for the top two income tax brackets at 36 and 39 6 percent to match the levels of the 1990s all other brackets would remain at todays rates they said to the charge of economic disaster obamas advisers would probably point to the relative prosperity of the 1990s the era whose tax rates they seek to return to mccain rejects allowing the bush administration tax cuts to expire on schedule saying that would result in higher taxes obama counters that the bush tax cuts favored the wealthy to begin with
5460650 amid rising concerns about the state of the u s economy new data compiled by economists at the oecd shows that for the 17th consecutive year the average rate of corporate taxes in non u s countries fell while the u s corporate tax rate stayed the same as a result the overall u s corporate tax rate is now 50 percent higher than the oecd average combined with another new oecd study that calls the corporate income tax the most harmful type of tax for economic growth the implications for u s policy are clear the long term prospects of the u s economy are at risk as long as our corporate tax rate remains out of step with the rest of the world the u s continues to have the second highest combined federal state corporate tax rate among industrialized countries at 39 3 percent only japan has a higher overall corporate tax rate at 39 5 percent by contrast the average corporate tax rate among oecd countries has fallen a full percentage point in the past year from 27 6 percent to 26 6 percent irelands 12 5 percent corporate tax rate remains the lowest among oecd nations the oecd data shows that nine of the 30 oecd member nations have lower corporate tax rates in 2008 than in 2007 including canada germany new zealand spain the united kingdom italy switzerland the czech republic and iceland germany made the biggest change cutting its corporate rate 8 7 percentage points from 38 9 percent to 30 18 percent consequently germany fell from having the third highest overall rate to seventh highest france now imposes the third highest rate of 34 4 percent italy had the second largest rate cut lowering its rate 5 5 percentage points from 33 percent to 27 5 percent consequently italy dropped in the rankings from seventh highest to fifteenth highest canada meanwhile dropped from fourth to fifth highest after cutting its overall corporate rate from 36 percent to 33 5 percent
5460651 as the tide of public opinion seems to shift in favor of house republicans demand for a vote on domestic energy exploration one supporting argument has yet to be discussed drilling as a way to lower your taxes opening our vast domestic resources both on and offshore to responsible oil and gas development would produce an influx of tax revenue from additional lease sales and royalties as well as from income and excise taxes these additional collections could be used for example to offset the alternative minimum tax amt the congressional research service recently estimated the potential federal revenue from arctic national wildlife refuge anwr oil development at 191 billion over 30 years roughly 18 36 per barrel based on projections of recoverable reserves applying that formula to the 107 billion plus barrels of recoverable oil that federal agencies estimate is in anwr the nearby national petroleum reserve and offshore tells us that sensible drilling could yield nearly 2 trillion in overall revenue over 30 years or an average of about 65 5 billion per year meanwhile the cost in lost tax collections of protecting 22 million families from the amt this year stands at about 62 billion that figure is sure to balloon in the future as more and more americans are ensnared by the complex system tax hungry politicians defend the amt by pointing to all the federal revenue that would be lost by ending it never mind the fact that amt revenue is ill gotten in the first place or that the estimated costs of its repeal to the federal budget ignore the benefits to economic growth and resulting additional revenues while oil and gas development wont fill governments coffers overnight it will provide a down payment in the near term and big windfalls in the out years that can help deal with some of the most intractable tax problems we face we helped create our energy supply problem by putting resources off limits lets develop those resources and use the revenue to help alleviate tax burdens in this difficult economy more supply lower gas prices greater energy security and lower taxes what are we waiting for

5460695 i was actively involved in meeting with franchisees at the beginning of the year who had been caught up in what is an alleged fraud and still subject to investigation by the relevant authorities including the
5460696 i have initiated this review to see whether there are any issues in the franchising sector that make a case for franchise specific regulation as they have in australia for example particularly to give more protection to franchisees
5460697 the brand took a big hit but fortunately the fraud broke over christmas that gave the mainstream media a lot to talk about but it was also a quiet sales period for us and we could pull senior management back from holidays
5460698 that allowed us a month to fix the mess establish the extent of the problem and see what action we should take we rolled out a rescue package offering investors to come into green acres at no charge and run a legitimate ironing business or move into other areas
5460699 the key objective of the review which will be supported by feedback from the sector is to explore whether there is some form of franchise specific regulation that could enhance the contractual arrangements that currently exist
5460700 the particular focus is on whether those entering into franchise agreements have adequate information to make good business decisions while ensuring that we dont impose unnecessary compliance costs on the sector that are disproportionate to the risks involved
5460701 the discussion document identifies three aspects of the franchising relationship that may make a case for franchise specific regulation

5460792 15th century pre hop era gruit ale recipe from the town of odense a delicate sweetness that balances the sour tartness making it far more accessible than a belgian lambic
5460793 flash forward to 2008 the beer is ready to go and anders is actually exporting some of this single batch limited edition brew to the united states old odense ale is available in the us through shelton brothers importing of belchertown ma get in touch with them if you want to track some of it down
5460794 this 7 5 abv beer is based on an english sweet stout our version has been added a cold water extract of organic mexican single estate espresso coffee beans the result is a discreet but delicate coffee aroma blending in with the roasted aromas from the dark malts and the other spicy stout aromas the taste is slightly sweet medium bodied with a balanced bitterness and after palate
5460795 is a present from the brewers to brew master anders on the first anniversary of n rrebro bryghus inspired by the southwest californian triple ipas it is brewed with british ale malts adjusted with several colour malts and spiced with extreme amounts of hops a dark golden extremely bitter ale 9 5 abv with a prominent hop aroma should be enjoyed as the final beer of the evening your taste buds cant be used after drinking this ale
5460796 norrebro bryghus is most well known for its north bridge extreme double ipa
5460797 little korkny ale n rrebro bryghus first barley wine as the style is called full bodied ale made of pale ale and crystal malt among others a strong 12 25 abv beer with a distinct sweetness and a well defines taste of cascade hops as well as a dash of plums and caramel

5460799 as i was passing a pickup truck in the other lane a dog riding in the back jumped out of the vehicle it was tied to the truck with a long length of chain
5460800 it was just awful i turned around to help the owners but the dog was covered in blood he was limp and lifeless when i got to them the owners were in shock one of them called 911 because the owners didnt know what else to do i gave them the number and directions for a local vet but i dont know what happened after that
5460801 this poor animal his chain was too long he had too much mobility in the back of the truck and he took advantage of it there are proper ways to secure a dog the best being having them ride inside the vehicle with a pet restraint or a secured crate if they are travelling in the back of a truck
5460802 for the most part people just dont realize how to secure their dog properly they think any length of chain or rope is fine because thats how theyve always done it i feel so bad for the family of this dog they were well meaning by using a chain to secure it they didnt mean for this happen they did have him restricted but it just wasnt enough
5460803 there is a fine of 109 under the motor vehicle act for failure to properly secure an animal while in transport but i dont think a lot of people know that
5460804 most of the calls we get about dogs in cars are to do with them trapped in vehicles on hot days people are starting to call in more and more about that because they are becoming familiar with the bylaw
5460805 its really motivated me to organize some educational clinics on pet safety in a blink of eye people can lose their pet if they dont know how to properly secure them id like to help make them aware of how to do that

5460814 our motivation to become an exchange has come from our desire to participate directly in the national market system and compete on a level playing field with our primary competitors
5460815 its my feeling she severely underestimated the gravity of the situation
5460816 he was at a bar with another girl i was so pissed he was like a father to me
5460817 im sorry for you im sure youve been abused physically sexually and other ways
5460818 i like my president to be smarter than me and i think obama is even with my masters degree
5460819 he doesnt give standard interviews politicians always fire off standard prepared answers but you can see he thinks about each question he gets
5460820 my problem with politics is you so rarely see anyone say i made a mistake or change with the times
5460821 we live in a society where things are constantly changing mccain sees so many things in black and white but our lives are in the gray zone
5460822 obama as president sends a message to the world heres the possibilities for all people
5460823 because hes half black and half white if i thought he was an idiot i wouldnt care if he was black i didnt vote for jesse jackson
5460824 all the last eight years have been disastrous for the people of oakland
5460825 the unemployment rate the economy is a key factor in crime people trying to find ways of getting by will turn to crime more often and this has extremely affected oakland
5460826 in stockton theyre leveling neighborhoods because of all the foreclosures
5460827 we havent seen these types of things since the great depression
5460828 thats why when i sold my practice in 2001 my wife opened up hers in san leandro
5460829 we have the same problem with real estate investors rental landlords
5460830 my next trip ill go to salinas and visit a little distillery there making whiskey
5460831 then im going to burning man for the first time in september im going to edinburgh then i have a book signing in venice and another in new york
5460832 when i was in the peace corps a photographer came and photographed my wife janet and i
5460833 as soon as i saw what he was doing i said i want to
5460834 you go into total culture shock when you meet other young couples your age who already have a house and two cars and a swimming pool and you dont i was doing the peace corps trying to save the world going to college and traveling and everybody else was zooming right by me trying to have what everybody in america has cars and washing machines youve got to have these material things and you have to have a job
5460835 he was the first one that i know of that really took his subjects and photographed them in a very documentary way but then added this very personal element with their own words being applied to the picture
5460836 i grew up in the suburbs of new england and bills work was very familiar territory to be sure
5460837 i grew up on a street that had kids who rode big wheels and dressed like cowboys and had air rifles like a very iconic image of bills i think his work really paved the way for those artists working in a photojournalistic way today
5460838 what he was trying to document was how these really good everyday ordinary people were incorporating or refusing to incorporate or dealing with all of the merging social values and loosening of hierarchies and social mores of the 1960s
5460839 i put my photography away for 20 years to raise a family
5460840 i want to set up the bicycle so i can be bicycling at burning man but im just sitting there
5460841 the purpose of advertising as far as i can see is to prove to the masses that a deodorant can bring happiness a mouthwash guarantee success and a laxative attract romance
5460842 and i said yeah i speak german like a native
5460843 there was a drug store i went in called the number and they said dean you stay outside and well pick you up in a staff car and they drove me up towards mount vernon and thats how i ended up at fort hunt it must have been end of november early december 1944
5460844 my job was to interrogate scientifically trained and experienced germans who had been sent to this country by the military
5460845 one of them was a person who worked on enriching uranium and i didnt know why anybody would want to enrich uranium i mean what does this have to do with anything
5460846 and so my job was to find out what he was doing and how it was being carried out and then i reported this to the pentagon
5460847 many of the archives were destroyed directly after the war and so if we didnt have the opportunity to speak with these men and capture their stories much of it may have been lost forever
5460848 there were a group of men sitting around a table in a room with great huge recorders recording everything these people said to each other
5460849 and so it sort of threw the prisoners off how did you know this how did you know that my daughter was 17 on march 28th so it really put them at a disadvantage
5460850 i was a pretty good athlete i would do sports with them in order to make them more cooperative i would take some of the people out for dinner at a restaurant in town in civilian clothes
5460851 it took quite some time before he was willing to cooperate the war had ended in europe and at that point he said hes willing to help us but his wife was at that point in what was in the russian zone
5460852 we told the sales person what size and so on and the woman held up a pair of panties
5460853 that should be long so as to cover their legs
5460854 for 63 years nobody ever said thank you and it was very nice to receive recognition that what we did was being recognized of being helpful to our country
5460855 yes we threatened them with being sent back to russia but there was no other personal harm of any kind and people thought they could be most effective as interrogators by being nice to the people they interrogated
5460856 championship manager computer game where 7 was the standard rating and anything outside of the 5 to 8 bracket seriously made you blink
5460857 no decision has been made about the teams yet but we are very keen to go and be one of the clubs involved in the first afl match played over there richmond president gary march told fairfax
5460858 its a great opportunity there are growing cultural and population ties between india and australia
5460859 the tigers being a revered animal in that country would be a perfect fit for the indian market
5460860 however i feel compelled to correct a number of inaccuracies in your post
5460861 they are at best located across a peering connection which could be taking place hundreds or thousands of miles away or across a transit connection which could incur similar distance imposed latency not to mention increased opportunity for packet loss and congestion

5460864 if it were up to me i would buy one a week until the prices started significantly turning around
5460865 quite a few of these are sales to investors who are renting out the homes to foreclosure victims
5460866 they can buy a home for under 90 000 have a payment of about 550 650 with taxes and insurance and rent it almost immediately for 900 to 1 100 per month
5460867 the goal will be to have the local government buy the property and keep the family in there
5460868 i think its going to make it more difficult for investors if local governments are going in and offering 60 cents on the dollar
5460869 people are really banking on future appreciation as the market corrects
5460870 prices have collapsed 40 to 50 percent sometimes 60 percent
5460871 every single closing ive had the banks have lost between 60 000 to 80 000
5460872 were seeing multiple offers on many of them and theyre bidding up over the asking price that will help to increase prices and stabilize the market
5460873 the rules have tightened down so much that theyve made us investors into what seems to be a high risk borrower
5460874 the reality is were not there are other ways to do it but its really hard to get conventional financing right now
5460875 banks loan mostly on the value of the house as opposed to me as a credit risk they look at the house and say this is a great bargain
5460876 eh kamu tau gak kenapa kok sekarang ekonomi amerika berantakan ini disebabkan karena satu orang coba tebak siapa dia
5460877 other refugees spoke of the georgian troops who had rampaged through their village and sent them into hiding along with other women and children in a cellar for two days
5460878 the georgians came in and killed everyone who is guilty it is saakashvili they burned all the houses and they even set fire to the school and the hospital nothing remains it all happened in one instant
5460879 they set off with other civilians in a bus which was ambushed by georgian forces as they tried to reach russia
5460880 i had to stop and we scattered along the highway
5460881 it was dark and i was hoping they wouldnt see as we hid but they must have been using night vision goggles because the georgian sniper fired pretty accurately albina was terrified and ran towards me thats when she was hit by a bullet that smashed right through her chest she died almost at once
5460882 were making soooo much money check out the solid gold toilets in the restrooms

5460886 this is the chance for a once in a lifetime stay in a home that played a major part in the life of an american music icon

5460888 posted at rge monitor 13 august 2008 here are some excerpts i recommend reading it in full
5460889 loan losses are likely to be higher for all banks than estimated earlier and that includes wells fargo
5460890 the opportunities to expand the customer base in bad times should meaningfully enhance the banks secular opportunities in good times
5460891 wells fargo continues to be the only bank in the u s to be rated aaa continues to grow has a strong balance sheet and has the strongest capital ratios in our peer group
5460892 given the companys diversification wells fargo continues to perform well during the current economic cycle just as it has endured through all kinds of economic cycles during our 156 year history
5460893 it dramatically overpaid for bear stearns to help the financial markets wells does not make a mistake like this
5460894 most banks that have cdos have written off amounts that are many multiple times the size of the wells fargo total portfolio
5460895 in good times customer memories will focus on the fact that when times were tough wells fargo was the bank to go to

5460901 protestants always have signs t shirts and the like with john 3 16 so it seems that for them that is the one definitive verse of the bible if you had to sum up the catholic faith in one bible verse or passage what would it be
5460902 for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
5460903 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all that i have commanded you and lo i am with you always to the close of the age
5460904 we bring a you some a beautiful granite you happy no
5460905 we are back playing but we have to take into account which players are reasonably match fit sharp and ready to play
5460906 as rangers found out the lithuanians are well into their season and we have players who havent had as many competitive matches as we would have liked
5460907 as we stand this is effectively our game in hand and if we win that we would be level with denmark and two points behind finland
5460908 but all we need to do is to win the next game its as simple as that if you dont do that then nothing else matters
5460909 garry and mark have been the defensive partnership in the last few games and have done well
5460910 we have lost steven naismith to a long term injury and steven fletcher has moved up to the full squad so thats two goal scorers and two centre halves out but its the type of thing that happens
5460911 in that situation you try and get people who will surprise you and do just as well and maybe even better than the players who have dropped out
5460912 we have cover at the back in scott cuthbert and andrew considine
5460913 andrew has been unfortunate not to get the start with us because he has been holding down a first team spot at aberdeen and playing well and scott now has the opportunity of first team football at st mirren
5460914 the good thing is that the ones you ask to step in have been with us for a period of time and they know all the boys who are in the squad

5460919 i really enjoyed the responsibility last season everyone could see that and i tried to do the best job i possibly could
5460920 it was a really positive experience and this season i have to use that and carry on doing my best for the team
5460921 i know a lot more about the job now thanks to last season

5460929 si no es amor qu es esto que me agobia de ternura
5460930 me estremec much simo con su poes a fue un contacto me identifiqu sin duda me hiciste recordar cuando estudiaba letras y busqu la poes a de owen pero no encontr lo que esperaba a lo mejor desde ah naci la duda despu s con el paso del tiempo segu estudiando la carrera primero trabaj una tesis sobre luis cernuda en ese entonces 1978 uno de los poetas de la generaci n del 27 menos conocido menos estudiado
5460931 owen se dedic m s que nada a vivir no a hacer carrera literaria como torres bodet o carlos pellicer
5460932 si he de vivir que sea sin tim n y en delirio
5460933 fui precisamente a buscar sus huellas y esto me ayud tambi n a tener otra interpretaci n de l a verlo desde su vida a buscar textos que no estaban en la edici n de las
5460934 lo maravilloso de owen es que transforma su ciudad natal en una generaci n reacia a hablar en primera persona lo que m s asombra es c mo owen est hablando de sus ra ces aquella vez iba rumbo a mazatl n en un viaje de vacaciones hace muchos a os fue muy poco tiempo no encontr nada todo fue de entrada por salida tiempo despu s empec a venir a culiac n a impartir el taller de creaci n literaria en difocur entonces ya ven a con m s calma m s tiempo una vez se hizo una mesa redonda sobe gilberto owen en rosario y fue muy interesante porque pude hacer m s cosas como ir al cementerio ver a los contempor neos de owen enterrados aprender algunas an cdotas de gente mayor que no recordaba a owen pero si cosas que hab an pasado en su ni ez
5460935 por ejemplo una cosa es el marruecos que viven los turistas y una cosa es el marruecos que viven los habitantes que ah nacieron y otro es el marruecos de la vida de goytizolo por eso insisto en que las ciudades los espacios son transformados por la literatura
5460936 eso fue lo m s emocionante ver en la sala el famoso retrato un retrato que s lo hab amos visto en papel y verlo ah ver que exist a fue muy emocionante
5460937 ahora veo todo de otra forma ahora entiendo muchas cosas que antes quiz no
5460938 les agradezco mucho todo lo que han dicho de gilberto owen un poeta muy olvidado porque yo soy la sobrina de gilberto owen
5460939 el libro de ruth apareci en 1944 owen lleg a m xico en 1942 y al estar viendo esas fotos vi una donde estaba ella de 18 a os y el t o con un traje blanco la est sosteniendo por la cintura en un parque entonces yo le coment que no parec an primos en la foto m s bien parec an novios y me dice bueno es que no s lo parec amos
5460940 invitaci n a gilberto owen hasta ahora y despu s de los viajes en busca de alguien que pueda darle alguna pista sobre el poeta a n queda la duda en el aire a n siente la angustia de la incertidumbre
5460941 recuerda aquella postura en que yo era tu t o y que ha eternizado otra fotograf a desenfocada por un temblor de tierra en la luna
5460942 ah estaba frente a mi blanca margarita y lo nico que hice fue lanzarme sobre ella
5460943 were truly a vacation destination now were hoping with the opening of this hotel well bring more people to the bangor area because when they come here theyll shop and eat and dine at other locations and businesses around the area
5460944 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5460945 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5460946 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5460947 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5460948 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5460949 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5460950 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5460951 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5460952 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5460953 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5460954 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5460955 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5460956 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5460957 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5460958 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5460959 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5460960 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5460961 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5460962 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5460963 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5460964 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5460965 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5460966 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5460967 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5460968 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5460969 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5460970 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5460971 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5460972 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5460973 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5460974 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5460975 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5460976 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5460977 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5460978 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5460979 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5460980 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5460981 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5460982 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5460983 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5460984 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5460985 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5460986 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5460987 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5460988 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5460989 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5460990 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

5460998 at the present time it is the fashion to ignore this aspect of faith indeed faith and knowledge as we have already observed are often divorced they are treated as though they belonged to two entirely different spheres and could therefore never by any chance come either into relation or contradiction
5460999 if you are a professor that trains prospective ministers are you a minister yourself
5461000 give an account of the hope that is in me
5461001 something was causing me a great deal of grief and distress and i started to think long and hard about how to get out of this situation by any means but i could not find any way out then i came across this verse and whosoever fears allah and keeps his duty to him he will make a way for him to get out of every difficulty 65 2 i realised that taqwa piety fearing allah is the way out of every kind of grief and distress as soon as i followed the path of taqwa i found the way out
5461002 and whatever the messenger gives you take it and whatever he forbids you leave it
5461003 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5461004 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5461005 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5461006 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

5461012 the last shes seen is walking east on east main street by the bridge
5461013 were hoping just to be able to come up with an identity of this person so then we can verify that nothing bad has happened to them
5461014 sir bob are you sitting down ok since peaches got married she has apparently slept with her ex and was spotted making out and groping some random guy at a club while on vacation with you as for her husband he apparently had a female house guest over the weekend who spent the night
5461015 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5461016 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5461017 the storms not a concern it just doesnt look like its going to do a lot of damage
5461018 very rare case reports of pancreatitis with complications or with a fatal outcome
5461019 the non hazardous solid waste services sector is undergoing a period of consolidation particularly in the u s market and we anticipate significant opportunities that we need to be in a position to act upon
5461020 id like to be comfortable and be able to say to you that that is over but i dont see it yet i dont see those numbers yet telling me that
5461021 i would never have predicted this much damage it certainly is a serious problem that has yet to have been addressed and it will be some time before it is addressed
5461022 it would probably be irresponsible of me to hit a number in advance
5461023 until we have that im not going to speculate on the numbers
5461024 if we wait much more time its going to make it almost impossible to make that up
5461025 some of these things become self fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile
5461026 while there has been a little bit of a setback one thing that was never really at issue was the application of the funds from dupont
5461027 weve been waiting for quite some time to make this happen and were really excited that its moving along and well get some houses fixed
5461028 im real proud of the team and the results we delivered in light of the environment
5461029 all things considered the quality of the second quarter earnings was good
5461030 that if you put on great programming that people want to watch they theyll show up
5461031 weve never contemplated it we dont think about it we like the business
5461032 i think its funny if a show is good and gets good ratings i dont mind if they poke fun at their parent every now and then
5461033 it is a great property but it simply didnt fit into our plays for 2009
5461034 im real proud of the team and the results we delivered in light of the environment
5461035 all things considered the quality of the second quarter earnings was good
5461036 well i cant say anything about other people i can only speak for myself the illusion of free will is so strong in my mind that i cant get away from it but i believe it is only an illusion but it is an illusion which is one of the strongest motives of my actions before i do anything i feel that i have choice and that influences what i do but afterwards when the thing is done i believe that it was inevitable from all eternity
5461037 why merely the futility of regret its no good crying over spilt milk because all the forces of the universe were bent on spilling it
5461038 seeing the trailers puts me off many more films than makes me want to see
5461039 seeing los acoplados me pone de muchas m s pel culas
5461040 seeing les bas de page me met outre de beaucoup
5461041 buena suerte dame esa mano ya no me prives de tu beldad
5461042 buena suerte dame esa dicha ya no me prives de tu beldad
5461043 s lo puedo mostrarte el p rtico eres tu quien debe atravesarlo
5461044 cbs asked us whos at the top of your dream list
5461045 without hesitation we said laurence fishburne he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range we had the opportunity to see mr fishburne in thurgood on broadway a few weeks ago and it was a truly profound experience the actor disappeared and thurgood marshall was standing there on the stage mr fishburne is also a talented writer and director if you distill csi down to its essence its a collaboration and we are so looking forward to collaborating with mr fishburne for all of us at csi this is truly a dream
5461046 we are excited to see the on screen chemistry and emotion this incredibly talented husband and wife team will bring to our show
5461047 fans are in for a treat and we couldnt be more thrilled that they chose er to make their first appearance together
5461048 we are going to have an employee discount for everyone program
5461049 we are going to issue a press release tomorrow morning with the details
5461050 we look forward to expanding our current support for hrc as they meet the challenges of transformation while continuing their critical wartime mission
5461051 dunn was going to be a free agent and griffey had an option we werent going to exercise so we just felt it was time to turn the page and get some players back to help give us more depth
5461052 they were both guys who had great careers here but it wasnt working so were trying something different
5461053 i think the fans like seeing the young players up here they like seeing the energy we have talent we just need experience
5461054 thats why were going to go down there and practice tomorrow to get some of that out of the way
5461055 everything ive heard from people who have gone in to the new stadium say it takes about 30 minutes to look at it and take everything in so wed prefer not to start 30 minutes behind we want to see if we can get a lot of that out of the way it will be different going in there
5461056 i think its great for the city and great for the organization
5461057 theyve been talking about it for a year now so you want to step foot in there and see what the big talk has been for a year
5461058 you want to go in and just live the moment
5461059 so we want do to that and get some of those jitters just out of the way
5461060 we just want to get used to it and get comfortable with the new stadium
5461061 i think you get some of those other things out of the way so you dont have trouble on game day just find the right route to the stadium and know where the locker rooms are
5461062 im pretty sure theyll give us the ins and outs about the stadium maybe the minor things
5461063 where to park the locker room is im pretty sure once we get there theyll let us know everything the main part is going in there and see how beautiful the stadium us
5461064 i guess you cant turn down new new is always good
5461065 i kind of feel like the old place kind of worked in our favor sometime
5461066 it got pretty loud in there hopefully we can get more fans in lucas oil stadium and get more yells
5461067 the only thing i need to be a fan of is the lighting hopefully the lighting is just perfect you dont want to be able to lose the ball in the light im sure with all that money invested in that place the lighting will be just right
5461068 it is supposed to be our home so whatever the kinks are we need to work out we need to get it done and go home
5461069 normally in the preseason we would practice monday and work on a few things so were going to take that practice down there
5461070 we want to see the stadium and get all of the logistics and where our guys park and all of those things but too we want to kick down there and throw and just get the feel of that in the stadium and get some fundamental work
5461071 were going to work on some situation work we need so hopefully its a combination of both
5461072 im here to kick ass and chew bubblegum and im all out of gum
5461073 im andre iguodala you dont know who i am im rich bitch
5461074 but youre going to feel his inflated contract at that box office
5461075 why im excited about the return of one tree hill
5461076 en tanto seguimos monitoreando la situaci n y es probablemente algo pronto hoy no hemos visto ning n movimiento significativo ruso fuera de georgia
5461077 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5461078 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5461079 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5461080 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5461081 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5461082 an explanation from the russians for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5461083 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5461084 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the cease fire and should be removed immediately
5461085 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5461086 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship
5461087 some roles are exhausting physically some are exhausting mentally some are really devastating psychologically vic mackey is all of that
5461088 you ever take a face cloth and soak it and wring it out thats me at the end of the day im a wrung out washcloth
5461089 honey were doing something incredibly special here this is going to be a knockout
5461090 i dont know how theyre going to get vic out of this one
5461091 i dont know how theyre going to pull the rabbit out of the hat this time
5461092 are they going to catch vic and its all over theyd have to tell me
5461093 i am the man on the wall you people who sit in your suburban households can look at what i do from a distance and go oh isnt that terrible isnt he awful but you cant handle the truth of what we need to do to protect ourselves
5461094 i dont know how you guys do it over there
5461095 i know vic is at the center of the show but what will make the show so much bigger so much greater is if we develop all of these characters into three dimensional characters
5461096 some of these things become self fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile
5461097 were certainly poised and ready when market conditions are appropriate
5461098 continues to exceed our regulatory capital requirements we continue to provide stability and liquidity to the housing market and we will continue to play a key role as the market recovers from this cycle
5461099 reason as any husband can tell you doesnt stand a chance in an argument with emotion this was the fundamental reason i believe that women were denied the vote for so long
5461100 what the feminists and their ventriloquist puppet husbands are talking about doing with government funded daycare is raising children as if they were a herd of interchangeable swine no surprise coming from a gender which has no ethics no scruples no sense of right and wrong
5461101 hier eindelijk de fotos van lancelot zijn 3e verjaardag ondertussen zijn we ook lekker op vakantie geweest naar noord frankrijk st vallery sur seine geweldig geweest en h l veel bekijks met lancelot gelukkig vond hij het allemaal goed die aandacht ook heerlijk in die hoge golven gezwommen met lancelot hij sprong over sommigen golven heen maar de meeste waren te hoog dan zag jem even niet proestend kwam hij dan weer boven en zwom gewoon verder nu is het gewone leven alweer een weekje bezig helaas maar over 6 weken gaan we weer dus geen klagen

5461107 once you try it and get a feel for it you realize how entirely cool it is
5461108 learning in the summer is good for winter riding but in winter it is not necessarily good in the summer
5461109 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5461110 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5461111 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5461112 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5461113 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5461114 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5461115 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5461116 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5461117 who are open to doing something on the production side
5461118 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5461119 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5461120 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5461121 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5461122 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5461123 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5461124 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5461125 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5461126 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5461127 there are guys down in guantanamo who would if you sat down next to them try to kill you
5461128 i walked in thinking that trials in gitmo were going to be like a court martial
5461129 then you realize the whole trial system is a sham there was a complete lack of due process it is disturbing and embarrassing what is going on down there
5461130 he has said a lot of things that dont stand up to facts
5461131 but in his case he was operating in guantanamo bay with no rules
5461132 you have to understand that colby is not a liberal he is a conservative who supported the administration and he believed in the war he was a true believer it took a long time for his views to shift
5461133 omar was in this stress position his hands behind his legs chained to his feet and he was chained to the floor
5461134 they come in they squirt pine sol on the ground and they grab omar and they use him as a human mop mopping up the urine in the pine sol with him and then just leaving him there with the urine and pine sol on his body
5461135 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5461136 opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5461137 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5461138 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5461139 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5461140 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5461141 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5461142 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5461143 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5461144 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5461145 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5461146 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5461147 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5461148 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5461149 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5461150 didnt get it i still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character
5461151 i get it this is so high brow and so f ing smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie
5461152 you know what f dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
5461153 nothing is happening and were no closer to a deal today than we were six weeks ago
5461154 has not up to this point been viewed as something the parties feel would facilitate an agreement
5461155 i understand that my decision is not acceptable you cannot ignore that fact there is the law but there is also a higher law i must follow as a matter of conscience
5461156 regardless of any executive proclamation i do not want the flags at the north carolina standards laboratory flown at half staff to honor jesse helms any time this week
5461157 un prieten a comandat o portie dubla de cartofi prajiti chelnerita tu ai avut portie dubla nu el da chelnerita eh nu ti am adus
5461158 theres only one thing different about barack obama when it comes to being a democratic presidential candidate hes half african american
5461159 whether that will make any difference i dont know i havent heard him have a strong crackdown on economic exploitation in the ghettos payday loans predatory lending asbestos lead whats keeping him from doing that is it because he wants to talk white he doesnt want to appear like jesse jackson well see all that play out in the next few months and if he gets elected afterwards
5461160 when you are doing restoration you want to re create a new element to support the title for years to come
5461161 it is critical that you retain as much of the original information that the filmmaker created as possible unless you are willing to work at 4k it is inevitable that you will lose a great deal of the information that was created and included in the original finished film

5461176 since this is the month of ramadhaan lets sit down and read a few ahaadiths so that we get some benefit from the time
5461177 for me this is a case about doing the right thing and being fair
5461178 not discriminating against people and doctors not playing the role of god saying because you are gay you are not worthy of having a child or a family
5461179 i did it not only for me my partner and my children but for other people coming after me so they dont have to go through the humiliation and frustration and abandonment as a patient
5461180 this organization takes the issue of the peoples right to know very very seriously we will do whatever we need and is necessary to ensure the public is informed
5461181 over the past four months there has been a dramatic increase in the number of freedom of information act requests in particular requests are sometimes very very broad in scope cover many many years of files including files that this organization has placed in the archives and in some cases the requests are written in a complex manner that requires considerable legal consultation

5461186 its in our criminal justice system that everyone is innocent until theyre proven guilty but in all reality until you actually are proven your innocence you carry the scarlet letter of the accused
5461187 they were very concerned and i was on the edge
5461188 things werent going well so i felt like i must open up before its too late i wont say that i contemplated suicide but i had some very i guess in my mind unrealistic thoughts about a lot of things i was really lost and just really felt like there was no outlet i know my mom was there but i want the rest of her life to be worry free so i try and keep everything from her i just felt alone you know
5461189 i guess now that ive spoken about my issues or my clinical depression if you will i think it really lifted a weight off of me because i received so many letters and emails good and bad but i just pay attention to the good ones and the people that i inspire that let me know that ive received a lot of phone calls from public figures and people who have gone through what im going through ive also learned that among african american men and really men period we just hold things in whether its a football player or a man you are still like im a man nothing bothers me but if you internalize it it has to come out somewhere people question my silliness but im a fun loving guy being around people i dont care what creed you are it just ignites my silliness youll never know if im hurting on the inside i found out

5461195 both reactionary religion and militant secularism are on the rise with both displaying a rigid certainty and a desire for power that will do nothing to benefit society in this context it is vital that people with open minded faith speak up and demonstrate alternatives altmuslim com has set many good examples in this regard

5461208 reminded of how it came into her possession deepa writes
5461209 he desired a brahmin girl apparently as a daughter in law though some accounts suggest he wanted to marry her however her father a poor brahmin man refused to give his daughter away in marriage and linga raja infuriated at the refusal had the innocent brahmin man tortured and killed at this very spot
5461210 on killing a brahmin he acquired the brahma hatya dosha and began to get nightmares falling off his throne and the like it was relentless then he was advised to seek redemption by building this temple

5461225 ive always loved sports i used to be on a track team in school and thats probably why i can think to myself now yeah i can do this which is totally crazy the team was a big part of my life back then and taught me so many things when i look back on my life and what im able to do its partly because of that early training it taught me discipline how to be committed about striving to win stamina all that good stuff the sports training also helped me deal with losing and rejection and all the things you go through when starting out in show business i think thats why i was able to bounce back all the time with track i didnt let anything get to me i would just think whatever tomorrows the next race and im going to train harder and win next week and i won maybe 70 or 80 medals and trophies over those years i should dig those out now ive come full circle i dont expect to win this race my goal is to finish ill probably end up crawling across the finish line but ill do it

5461265 i recall john telling that story when we first got together in 1971 when were talking about every conceivable thing that had ever happened to us when we were in prison
5461266 most of us had been kept apart or in small groups then in 1970 they moved us into the big cell and when we all got to see each other and talk to each other directly instead of tapping through walls we had 24 hours a day seven days a week to talk to each other and we shared stories i vaguely recall that story being told among other stories
5461267 there were several stories similar to that in which guards a very few i might add showed compassion to the prisoners it was rare and i never met one but some of the guys did

5461310 hes been working with our hitting coach don long and is getting better he worked to get a good pitch to hit im sure it was a nice boost to get that
5461311 if we hang around long enough we have the ability to get it done
5461312 we took advantage of a couple of mistakes to push across some runs
5461313 it was just a lot of pitches a lot of pitches
5461314 weve got to find a better way of economizing those pitches at some point
5461315 its not getting any worse but its not getting any better

5461321 i believe mccain will be a better commander in chief than obama who also opposes gay marriage if we have an experienced seasoned person defending the country in this dangerous age we will be able to argue about the gay agenda later

5461338 i cannot rule out that they might use mercenaries with slavic appearance for a provocation clad in the uniform of russian servicemen in order to commit subversive acts both on ossetian and russian territory
5461339 the georgian peacekeeping contingent was given the task to stop and obstruct the advancement of russian forces through the roki tunnel should they try to help the peacekeeping group
5461340 for this purpose they stockpiled arms by various means which could be used to arrange a bloodbath and obstruct the movement of any convoys in both the tunnel and the mountain pass
5461341 initiated a genocide probe based on reports of actions committed by georgian troops aimed at murdering russian citizens ethnic ossetians living in south ossetia
5461342 the situation when one who committed thousands of crimes is characterised as a terrorist and another as a president of a sovereign state is very strange
5461343 as more and more information is collected and kept on all of us we are very concerned that appropriate safeguards go along with that
5461344 people should know what is happening with their information and have a choice
5461345 our concern is that what is kept with the justification of preventing and detecting terrorism can then be used for minor purposes such as pursuing people for parking fines
5461346 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do

5461375 can such a vast ball of fire can stay up there in space just the right distance away to produce just enough heat and light for human beings on earth who put the sun there and how and why
5461376 the sun is a perfectly normal star and its been there for billions of years moreover nobody placed it there it appeared by chance as a result of a big explosion that took place and the earth again by coincidence formed in just the right spot for human life to exist
5461377 that the sun gives us heat and light is a manifestation of gods endless knowledge and perfect creativity if he had not willed the sun to exist we would not have been able to live our lives here on earth had the sun been either closer to or further from the earth we still couldnt exist just like everything else around us the sun is a miracle and a mercy from god it should be a means for us to remember him and to thank him continuously

5461396 nor can it be doubted but that under the pretense of holy zeal superstitious men give way to the indulgences of the flesh and satan baits his fictitious modes of worship with such attractions that they are willingly and eagerly caught hold of and obstinately retained
5461397 this single consideration when the inquiry relates to the worship of god ought to be sufficient for restraining the insolence of our mind that god is so far from being like us that those things which please us most are for him loathsome and nauseating
5461398 and undoubtedly this is the origin of all superstitions that men are delighted with their own inventions and choose to be wise in their own eyes rather than restrain their senses in obedience to god
5461399 the more it delights human nature the more it is to be suspected by believers
5461400 nothing is more abominable in the sight of god than pretended worship which proceeds from human contrivance

5461419 postoperative ileus inability of the intestines to pass contents is regarded as an inevitable response to the trauma of abdominal surgery and is a major contributing factor to postoperative pain and discomfort associated with abdominal distension nausea vomiting and cramping pain
5461420 postoperative length of hospital stay was assessed in four trials comprising 134 patients
5461421 this was also reduced in the chewing gum group by longer than one day however this result was not statistically significant
5461422 in conclusion we feel that the current evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of stay
5461423 the potential benefits to individual patients in health economics terms are such that a well designed large scale blinded randomized controlled trial with a placebo arm is warranted to answer the question of whether gum chewing can significantly reduce the length of stay after abdominal surgery or whether it merely represents a placebo effect
5461424 the tracking system is deployed and working which is great news
5461425 we started ultrasonic tagging programs in maine in 1997 and have learned much about salmon ecology in the estuaries and bays of the gulf of maine
5461426 our team is really excited that fish from our most recent work in the penobscot river have been detected so far along on their migration northward the first data provided valuable information about how long it took atlantic salmon from the penobscot river to reach halifax
5461427 given the fact that we are looking for a fish that is still less than a foot long that could be anywhere in the northwest atlantic ocean finding them in such apparent concentrations hundreds of miles from brewer maine is remarkable and very encouraging
5461428 broad scale ocean arrays such as the halifax array are a great tool to examine the marine ecology of such an uncommon fish in a large marine environment
5461429 we have three scientists in the labrador sea right now working with canadian colleagues as part of the international salmon at sea salsea project to determine where atlantic salmon are and are not and to try to get detailed genetic and dietary information about the various north atlantic salmon stocks
5461430 atlantic salmon are an iconic fish but theyre endangered and people want to know whats happening to the population

5461442 lack of benefit of pelvic radiation in prostate cancer patients with a high risk of positive pelvic lymph nodes treated with high dose radiation
5461443 treatment of prostate cancer with radiotherapy should the entire seminal vesicles be included in the clinical target volume
5461444 a randomized comparison of interfraction and intrafraction prostate motion with and without abdominal compression
5461445 although significant prostate displacement can occur between treatments the typical range of movement seen along a major axis was less than 5 mm proper treatment planning should consider the movement of the target independent of surrounding bony anatomy
5461446 changes in prostate position of this magnitude preclude the use of standard margins
5461447 prostatic displacement during a course of radiotherapy is more pronounced among patients with initial planning scans with large rectal and bladder volumes such patients may require more generous margins around the ctv to assure its enclosure within the prescription dose region
5461448 margins between the ctv and ptv based on the simple geometric requirement that a point on the edge of the ctv is enclosed by the ptv 95 of the time are 0 7 cm in the lateral and cranial caudal directions and 1 1 cm in the anterior posterior direction however minimum dose to the ctv and avoidance of organs at risk are more important considerations when drawing beam apertures more consistent methods for reproducing prostate position e g empty rectum and more sophisticated beam aperture optimization are needed to guarantee consistent coverage of the ctv while avoiding organs at risk
5461449 target motion occurs during the course of treatment planning and delivery and should be considered when designing conformal radiation fields
5461450 changes in the location of the prostate seminal vesicles and normal tissue volumes during the course of radiation therapy occur and have dosimetric consequences that may impact tumor control and normal tissue complication probabilities
5461451 although the accuracy of the bat was not addressed in this investigation we found a significant percentage of large shifts being made from the initial alignment position

5461471 what happens to testosterone after prostate radiation monotherapy and does it matter
5461472 neoadjuvant hormonal therapy effectively reduces the volume of normal tissue exposed to high radiation doses in the majority of treated patients and decreases the potential morbidity of therapy
5461473 phase ii dose escalation study of image guided adaptive radiotherapy for prostate cancer use of dose volume constraints to achieve rectal isotoxicity
5461474 in intermediate and high risk prostate cancer patients although it appears that radiation dose escalation may improve psa df outcome the price paid in treatment morbidity can be high without adequate attention to dose volume constraints of normal tissue care must be taken to consider not only the hazard of tumor recurrence but also that of complications
5461475 dose volume histogram analyses clearly indicated a volume effect on the probability of developing late rectal complications therefore dose escalation may be safely achieved by adherence to dose volume histogram constraints during treatment planning and organ localization at the time of treatment to ensure consistent patient setup
5461476 significant volume effects were found in the probability of late rectal bleeding for patients undergoing 3d crt for prostate cancer with prescription doses of 70 2 and 75 6 gy the percent volumes exposed to 71 and 77 gy in the 70 2 and 75 6 gy dose groups respectively were significantly correlated with rectal bleeding the independent correlation of small v rw with rectal bleeding may indicate the existence of a functional reserve for the rectum the independent association with larger percent volumes exposed to intermediate doses approximately 46 gy seen in both dose groups may indicate that a large surrounding region of intermediate dose may interfere with the ability to repair the effects of a central high dose region

5461490 id suggest cr molony go off to school somewhere and get educated about what responsibility he holds on behalf of the community etiquette school perhaps
5461491 what do these sorts of statements say about our community its horrifying that in this day and age a public figure would say such things what era is he living in
5461492 but hes correct in saying there is a gender imbalance there are a lot of young men in town who would love to have families and would love to have a partner

5461536 no end in sight is a great record track after track
5461537 this was not a hard decision to make pro pain are also a very hard working band with a die hard following and regain is very happy to be working with them
5461538 the new cd offers a wide variety of styles more so than any of its predecessors however a fair percentage of the recording is also very traditional in the pro pain sense and sonically heavy no end in sight is exactly the type of album that we wanted to create this time around so we couldnt be more pleased with it

5461552 it just got a lot more interesting covering the jets this year
5461553 as if the millions spent in upgrades this off season werent enough of a story adding a three time mvp at quarterback has put the jets front and center on the nations biggest stage
5461554 it takes a lot to steal the spotlight away from the super bowl champion giants in new york but the jets will have more eyes on them this year than the g men
5461555 life has certainly gotten a little more hectic since the trade for brett favre case in point i dont think weve ever had a request for a story on a qb running a penalty lap until now
5461556 i grew up in indiana and the nfl was always a passion of mine
5461557 when i got the job offer here at sny part of the reason was knowing there was a deal on the table between the jets and sny that we would have jets coverage so the jets were the linchpin in whether or not i was going to make the trip to new york
5461558 believe me it helps our coverage a great deal to have me coming out here every practice
5461559 and its not about being buddy buddy and building friendships its about building trust making sure youre covering the events the way they happen and not taking anybodys side when youre covering an event
5461560 im very happy to stay here at sny if they decide to re up me

5461592 the last time we had this level of socialism being proposed and inexperience at the helm was jimmy carter
5461593 well hes promoting what i would term a government takeover of the health system
5461594 he has said he wants to mandate free college tuition for every student in america
5461595 unlike ted kennedy he meant jack kennedy of course who said dont ask what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country he obama says were the wealthiest country in the world you should get this you should get that youre entitled to this youre entitled to that to me thats a move toward socialism
5461596 im familiar with what his work was here at the state capitol and to me the best indicator of future behavior is past behavior
5461597 and he has supported what i would consider to be socialistic moves on health care as a state senator

5461642 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5461643 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5461644 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5461645 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5461646 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5461647 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5461648 the other day and i cant believe you didnt include your ridiculous fear of dolphins

5461652 es el estimulo ojal que nos alcance as hasta el cierre del torneo eso es lo que buscamos que el d a con d a el equipo avance funcione y que le d una continuidad a su que hacer
5461653 por lo dif cil de las condiciones por lo que atlas nos agobi al inicio del partido y es muy meritorio que el equipo mantuvo una concentraci n a favor del grupo
5461654 va a ser dif cil pues el equipo a mejorado es un partido mucho muy importante pensar que no van a regalar nada va a ser un equipo que se va a venir a defender mucho nosotros necesitamos mostrar mucha aplicaci n y concentraci n sin duda alguna va a ser uno de los partidos m s dif ciles
5461655 es un plus que determina que dif cilmente nos podemos sorprender pero la diferencia termina por ser el jugador la calidad la concentraci n la actitud nosotros hoy tenemos un funcionamiento pero tambi n tenemos que hacer modificaciones a futuro para tener otra opciones en el juego
5461656 el presidente sensi que hasta el ltimo momento ha sido part cipe de los asuntos de la sociedad contribuyendo a llevar a los primeros puestos de las clasificaciones italianas y europeas falleci en la noche del domingo confortado por el afecto de sus seres queridos
5461657 ser estupendo si logr semos el tercer scudetto pero recordad que antes que cualquier xito el orgullo mayor es el de haber nacido seguidores de este equipo

5461663 como persona soy el mismo me han inculcado los valores de can bar a y tengo la misma educaci n de siempre en cambio como futbolista he ido evolucionando y madurando entiendo mucho m s el juego en qu momento has hacer una pausa en el juego qu necesita el equipo y hablo mucho m s en el campo
5461664 estoy muy contento de haber superado a todos estos mitos del barcelonismo y todav a me quedan un par por superar migueli y reixach porque todav a tengo fuerza y me siento til para seguir jugando en el fc barcelona
5461665 el hecho que de pep estuviera lesionado y que yo debiera ocupar su posici n en aquel momento cuando l era un s mbolo de la culerada fue un reto incre ble
5461666 yo s lo ten a 18 a os y asumir el rol que ten a pep en aquel equipo fue muy dif cil pero todo el mundo me apoy mucho y van gaal confi plenamente en m adem s recuerdo mucho el apoyo de pep a n cuando l estaba lesionado y en su d a nos quisieron enfrentar recuerdo mucho su madurez y sus consejos
5461667 le gustaba mucho ordenar y tenerte siempre controlado l era el eje de aquel equipo y por lo tanto era un jugador que mandaba mucho ya era un enfermo del futbol y no ha cambiado
5461668 no pas bamos por un buen momento ni social ni deportivo y aquello pesa pero a la vez te hace m s fuerte a jugadores como a m y a carles puyol nos pes mucho la verdad es que es triste por suerte nos rehicimos
5461669 las sensaciones que est dando este equipo en la pretemporada la din mica que se ve en el juego el car cter ganador la presi n que hacemos ahora en campo contrario etc son situaciones y sensaciones que me hacen pensar que este a o puede ir muy bien
5461670 esta sanci n no es correcta porque no creo que haya cometido ning n crimen que se merezca esa cantidad
5461671 patients overwhelmingly believe that their serious eye diseases should and must be treated by a medical doctor

5461673 its clear that state attorneys general are not doing a whole lot about internet consumer protection
5461674 they havent made it a priority in the states that have made it a priority theyve been able to win settlements
5461675 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5461676 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5461677 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5461678 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5461679 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5461682 obama cant possibly be elitist he just paid off his student loans
5461683 just mccain is a ridiculously wealthy person who has lived a life of privilege his entire life
5461684 barack obama is a person who grew up in a traditional middle to upper middle class home and worked his way through life took college loans out to get through school

5461691 have me as a man who ended a relationship stand here and write some truth have me stand up for somebody and write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met
5461692 why are you asking me that question im being as honest as i can possibly can be
5461693 i ended a relationship because there is no lying i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right i dont waste peoples time
5461694 i guarantee you that 20 percent of the people on this street right now who are in a relationship wish they could get out but they dont know how and im going to be honest on the way in to my relationships and im going to be honest on the way out of my relationships

5461699 pone en pie de igualdad a las concubinas y concubinos de la diversidad sexual con las heterosexuales
5461700 este anuncio que llega tras diversas conversaciones entre la falgbt el inadi y el organismo de la seguridad social constituye un avance sustantivo en el reconocimiento de las familias de la diversidad y los derechos que leg timamente corresponden al colectivo lgbt
5461701 estos avances nos dan fuerza para seguir trabajando hacia la igualdad plena que la constituye la sanci n de una ley nacional de matrimonio para personas del mismo sexo que ya se tramita en las comisiones del congreso de la naci n y que debe garantizar los mismos derechos con los mismos nombres para todas y todos
5461702 es correcto que se pueda decidir sobre los derechos de herencias si no se hieren derechos ya adquiridos de otros
5461703 en esos casos habr a que reglamentar la ley de tal modo que los hijos no pierdan sus derechos
5461704 no corresponde asimilar las uniones homosexuales al matrimonio otorg ndole los mismos beneficios sociales

5461708 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5461709 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5461710 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
5461711 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5461712 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
5461713 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
5461714 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
5461715 hydrogen has long been considered the ideal clean green fuel energy rich and carbon neutral the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world
5461716 proposed cuts in subsidies of up to 30 have been watered down to only 9 to 10 a year until
5461717 energy autonomy is possible but it is not an easy way to go

5461721 understood me well it seemed like he was no matter what kind of night i had at work i could always count on seeing them and cheering up
5461722 we expect to get quite a few more fires out of this
5461723 it wasnt to enable others to get a free fare or cause any sort of havoc
5461724 it was really to show how major the issues are in this system which also might resonate in many other systems around the world
5461725 focused on an increase in ridership for buses operated by the lowell regional transit authority
5461726 despite receiving summonses to appear before the committee this witnesses defied the committee and refused to testify
5461727 instead they took the obstructionist route a tactic ripped from the pages of the now infamous conservative dirty tricks handbook

5461733 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5461734 the russian side is gravely violating the conditions provided for by the peace accord signed by the presidents of georgia france and the russian federation
5461735 persistent delay in the withdrawal of its forces from georgia
5461736 lets then start thinking negotiating how can we prevent the definitive estrangement of our two countries
5461737 while the summer and fall of 2007 saw a blooming of rich color and flowing curls among styles the new year will be heralded with more subdued looks as is customary with winter styles the colors will grow darker and highlighting will be more subdued those rich and bold tones and colors will be foresworn in favor of higher gloss in their darker shades the free flowing and energetic curls will give way to sleek and smooth styling even those who choose to keep their waves and curls will opt for more controlled and cleanly defined tresses
5461738 while the summer and fall of 2007 saw a blooming of rich color and flowing curls among styles the new year will be heralded with more subdued looks
5461739 even if you dont opt for a bob consider going shorter for the new year
5461740 one added benefit for trimming at least a few inches is that you leave your hair healthier overall remember if you start at the scalp and move outward toward the ends of the hair every six inches traveled equates to around a year of growing time so for the woman whose hair is more than shoulder length the last couple of inches of hair have been exposed to around two years worth of styling abuse
5461741 remember that the ultimate goal of style and fashion is to help us put our best foot forward

5461750 we are not trying to cause the economic collapse of the roman catholic church but to illustrate to the court the magnitude of the plot against our order
5461751 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5461752 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile programme have been a subject of iaea discussions and are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5461753 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5461754 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles
5461755 iranian experts can put the national satellite into orbit in the not too distant future
5461756 we are seeing evidence of ss 21 missiles in south ossetia
5461757 but let me be clear if it rolled in after august 6th it needs to roll out
5461758 that would be in keeping with the russian commitment on withdrawal
5461759 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the ceasefire and should be removed immediately
5461760 the only forces that are permitted to remain under the ceasefire agreement are the forces that were in there at the august 6th time frame
5461761 were seeing them solidify their positions in south ossetia and abkhazia
5461762 i cant say whether they are actually moving people out right now or not but we do expect them to start moving out we expect them to move out slowly so this may take some time
5461763 when we received news of the first two ss 21 russian missile launchers into georgian territory

5461775 there has been a growing black middle class in gauteng but there was also rapid growth in places like diepsloot
5461776 the western cape is getting a lot of very low income people from the eastern cape gauteng is getting them from mpumalanga north west and especially limpopo those people will explain why your african household income hasnt grown much faster
5461777 i expected that the highest income group would have spent much more on clothing footwear and accessories than the lowest but that wasnt necessarily the case one of the reasons is that a lot of poorer people though they cant really afford it are buying branded stuff
5461778 cellphones presumably would have a luxury profile but theyre being seen as a necessity even in the lower income groups
5461779 youre finding more and more black households that are doing quite well at the moment
5461780 after completing a bachelors degree your salary rises by more than 350 percent when compared to that of a matriculant
5461781 a business owner typically gets 14 percent more than someone working for someone else
5461782 as people become more affluent especially blacks you would expect their spending profile to become similar to that of the western profile but its not happening
5461783 kannst du das nicht machen ich wei doch gar nicht was ich denen sagen soll was da kaputt ist
5461784 if it were to come straight up and across the western carolinas
5461785 a big rain like this could give great benefits to the lakes and reservoirs and the ground water

5461795 its absolutely true that theres certainly a deficit that we have in terms of some of the performance benchmarks for our desktop processors right now our phenom versus the competitors
5461796 the mainstream and value pc segments comprises of over 80 of the profits of client computing so its less than 20 thats really embodied in the high end performance space and when you look at that mainstream and value space i would beg to differ in terms of the suitability of our processors our processors that we have in the market today actually exceed the requirements for that mainstream and value space

5461824 ford is a leader in safety and fuel economy not even toyota or honda can match the new escapes safety and fuel efficiency ratings
5461825 ford has more five star rated vehicles than any other automaker and weve committed to lead or be at the top of every segment in which we compete in terms of fuel efficiency
5461826 weve devoted many hours to analyzing and developing the body structure safety belts and air bags of escape and mariner for better performance in front and side impact crashes

5461835 ik trek het mij persoonlijk aan dat u de waarde van uw beleggingen zo hebt zien kelderen
5461836 de overgrote meerderheid van aandeelhouders groot en klein en ook van onze klanten is gelukkig en steunt ons
5461837 kunnen wij conclusies aan deze bijeenkomst verbinden kunnen wij ons erop beroepen
5461838 dit soort avonden zullen we op reguliere basis voor u organiseren
5461839 eigenlijk heb ik niet zo veel grote zorgen over dit bedrijf alle financi le fondsen hebben het momenteel zwaar ik dacht dat ik fortis op het dieptepunt kocht op 12 euro als ik een zorg heb gaat die over het geringe vertrouwen dat er bestaat in de financi le sector in het algemeen maar ik denk dat in 2009 en 2010 het vertrouwen weer terugzal keren
5461840 wat gaan ze doen om het geschonden vertrouwen van de aandeelhouders te herstellen
5461841 een speciale aandeelhoudersvergadering zoals door de veb wordt voorgesteld is naar mijn mening overdreven er zijn wel enkele onderdelen uit het tienpuntenplanplan van de veb die volgens mij belangrijk zijn fortis zou bijvoorbeeld de risico en controlesystemen moeten versterken ook zou het bedrijf moeten werken aan de transparantie en die verbeteren zoals is voorgesteld
5461842 ik erger me groen en geel aan de mediahetze die dit bedrijf treft de georkestreerde campagne van de veb beleggersvereniging red heeft de problemen waarin fortis verkeert verergerd het begon met de kritiek op de beloning van bestuursvoorzitter votron vervolgens stapt meneer slagter directeur van de veb red het fortiskantoor binnen met een cameraploeg van het journaal in zijn kielzog en dan komt de beschuldiging van misleiding aan het adres van de raad van bestuur allemaal negatieve kritiek die niet het belang van de aandeelhouders heeft gediend
5461843 wanneer houdt de veb nu eens op met die hetze
5461844 votron moet terugkeren als bestuursvoorzitter hij is een fantastische vent een ziener met amerikaanse doortastendheid alleen hij is in staat om fortis weer uit de problemen te krijgen het is een schande dat hij het veld heeft moeten ruimen
5461845 flink verlies ik heb mn aandelen gekocht voor ruim 24 euro nu staat de koers onder de 10
5461846 de situatie met de kredietcrisis bezorgt alle beleggers veel onzekerheid maar voor de aandeelhouders van dit bedrijf is het extra pijnlijk dat het bestuur anders dan beloofd toch zijn dividendbeleid heeft gewijzigd
5461847 mijn aandelenbelang is te klein om echt boos te zijn maar ik ben erg benieuwd of het management eigenlijk zelf weet of alle leed nu is geschikt de onverwachte kapitaalmaatregelen van eind juni bewijzen dat de raad van bestuur er goed in is zaken te onderschatten
5461848 steven took a knock to his knee yesterday in training so as a precautionary measure we just thought it was better that he sit out the session this evening

5461860 as a lawyer i represented several welding shops fabrication facilities and ship yards and always wondered how the welding process was accomplished
5461861 welding involves metallurgy heat control and technique that are best learned by formal training trial and error can be time consuming and expensive to say nothing of the frustration levels experienced the luxury of having a well experienced teacher or professor to trouble shoot your errors and make helpful suggestions is invaluable i have also had the advantage of using the best of equipment and consumables all for a very nominal expense
5461862 i have already put my gas metal arc mig welding class training taken last fall to valuable use
5461863 i have also completed various repairs to a tractor a trailer and i am designing a customized fire place for one of my childrens home
5461864 there is no shortage for projects i am now in my second class involving gas tungsten arc tig welding which i plan to use in welded sculpture projects that are really fascinating
5461865 being involved with a group of very interesting and dedicated teachers and students has been very satisfying i have so much enjoyed meeting and observing young men who are dedicated to their training and advancement for a better position in life unfortunately as a judge i see all too many rudderless youth that possess no compass in their life to advance and better themselves it is a blessing to associate with these task oriented young men who have a mission and are willing to sweat and try again to improve their skills
5461866 professor russell mcdonald is a prize of experience and gentle instruction james childs is an unflappable instructor that is so willing to share his extensive experience no matter how bad you are performing that evening lucky i have never known any other name is a real magician with a welding torch he is so willing to show you the procedure again and again without judgmental comments
5461867 i have even had help from another instructor that is not connected with my regular class but answered the call for help just because
5461868 the location is convenient and people like cece sutphen the colleges media relations manager who found me wandering around the campus last fall found a class for me that had closed and again this summer assisted in getting me enrolled her kind assistance made my welding training possible and now my number 11th and 12th grandchildren will have iron baby beds to sleep in

5461992 the church has a single undeviating standard of sexual morality intimate relations are proper only between a husband and a wife united in the bonds of matrimony
5461993 protecting marriage between a man and a woman does not affect church members christian obligations of love kindness and humanity toward all people
5461994 we should love them but they arent entitled to be treated the same as us
5461995 marriage is sacred ordained of god from before the foundation of the world
5461996 children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony
5461997 gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal mortal and eternal identity and purpose
5461998 marriage between a man and a woman is central to the plan of salvation the sacred nature of marriage is closely linked to the power of procreation only a man and a woman together have the natural biological capacity to conceive children this power of procreation to create life and bring gods spirit children into the world is sacred and precious misuse of this power undermines the institution of the family and thereby weakens the social fabric
5461999 strong families serve as the fundamental institution for transmitting to future generations the moral strengths traditions and values that sustain civilization
5462000 in recent years in the united states and other countries a movement has emerged to promote same sex marriage as an inherent or constitutional right this is not a small step but a radical change instead of society tolerating or accepting private consensual sexual behavior between adults advocates of same sex marriage seek its official endorsement and recognition
5462001 promote marriage as an inherent right of all regardless of sexual orientation
5462002 the people of the united states acting either directly or through their elected representatives have recognized the crucial role that traditional marriage has played and must continue to play in american society if children and families are to be protected and moral values propagated
5462003 forty four states have passed legislation making clear that marriage is between a man and a woman more than half of those states twenty seven in all have done so by constitutional amendments like the ones pending in california arizona and florida
5462004 in contrast those who would impose same sex marriage on american society have chosen a different course advocates have taken their case to the state courts asking judges to remake the institution of marriage that society has accepted and depended upon for millennia
5462005 in todays secular world the idea of tolerance has come to mean something entirely different
5462006 tolerance obviously requires a non contentious manner of relating toward one anothers differences but tolerance does not require abandoning ones standards or ones opinions on political or public policy choices tolerance is a way of reacting to diversity not a command to insulate it from examination
5462007 legalizing same sex marriage will affect a wide spectrum of government activities and policies
5462008 the experience of the few european countries that already have legalized same sex marriage suggests that any dilution of the traditional definition of marriage will further erode the already weakened stability of marriages and family generally
5462009 aside from the very serious consequence of undermining and diluting the sacred nature of marriage between a man and a woman
5462010 when a man and a woman marry with the intention of forming a new family their success in that endeavor depends on their willingness to renounce the single minded pursuit of self fulfillment and to sacrifice their time and means to the nurturing and rearing of their children two individuals of the same gender whatever their affections can never form a marriage devoted to raising their own mutual offspring
5462011 these developments will create serious clashes between the agenda of the secular school system and the right of parents to teach their children traditional standards of morality
5462012 finally throughout history the family has served as an essential bulwark of individual liberty the walls of a home provide a defense against detrimental social influences and the sometimes overreaching powers of government in the absence of abuse or neglect government does not have the right to intervene in the rearing and moral education of children in the home strong families are thus vital for political freedom but when governments presume to redefine the nature of marriage issuing regulations to ensure public acceptance of non traditional unions they have moved a step closer to intervening in the sacred sphere of domestic life the consequences of crossing this line are many and unpredictable but likely would include an increase in the power and reach of the state toward whatever ends it seeks to pursue
5462013 strong stable families headed by a father and mother are the anchor of civilized society

5462159 if my theory is correct i again urge those people to do the ethical thing now and disclose all relevant information to the american electorate and the democratic convention delegates it is the right and the patriotic thing to do especially if the information demonstrates that obama has been deceptive

5462173 what will u s suburbs look like in 40 years
5462174 the suburbs have three destinies none of them exclusive as materials salvage as slums and as ruins
5462175 poured a half century of our national wealth into a living arrangement with no future
5462176 to pay for the expanded services taxes will also increase exponentially to the point where individual pay checks are made payable to the government and deposited directly in the general treasury
5462177 if gentrification continues in a significant way large numbers of suburban households looking for urban stimulation may end up switching places with minority central city dwellers stirring the ethnic pot in both places
5462178 suburbanization has shown a white bias with most minority households yet to acquire their nice house in the suburbs some of this difference may reflect a history of housing market discrimination but lower suburbanization by minorities is mainly a result of lower incomes as the black and hispanic middle classes continue to grow and get richer they are likely to follow the same suburbanization path as white households before them restrained somewhat by higher gas prices
5462179 the will and grace version of gay america urban wealthy and white is starting to look a bit dated
5462180 suburbia will be flexible it will be smarter and it will be hybrid
5462181 hybrid place that melds desirable traits of city living activity diversity while still maintaining allegiance to primary suburban ideals of selfhood and domesticity and one might add consumption
5462182 it depends on how smart and bold we are willing to be

5462215 such individual has during the 180 day period preceding the date of filing of the petition by such individual received counseling
5462216 t he filing of the petition is treated throughout the bankruptcy code as a bright line that defines the estate and alters the rights and responsibilities of the debtor and its creditors
5462217 t he focus of our inquiry is not whether debtors credit counseling was obtained within the 180 day period but rather whether it was obtained by the statutorily imposed deadline given that nothing in the legislative history supports an interpretation of that deadline as including a waiting period prior to filing of the petition as well as the difficulty of enforcing such a waiting period under the current statutory language we conclude that a debtor qualifies as a debtor under section 109 so long as he or she completes the required credit counseling at any time between 180 days before and the moment of filing the petition

5462260 consumers who are better aware of the operations of their vehicle will be rewarded by saving money at the gas pump and reducing co2 emissions working together we can substantially reduce co2 emissions and fuel use one ecodriver at a time
5462261 were all in this together so theres a role for each one of us to play in being a part of the solution to these critical issues
5462262 automakers are aggressively developing and introducing new technologies but it takes 15 years or more for these technologies to become widespread on the road ecodriving helps consumers reduce carbon dioxide emissions today

5462285 i have to see the colosseum and the vatican and sistine chapel

5462305 since 1999 new evidence has seriously weakened the case that carbon emissions are the main cause of global warming and by 2007 the evidence was pretty conclusive that carbon played only a minor role and was not the main cause of the recent global warming the world has spent 50 billion on global warming since 1990 and we have not found any actual evidence that carbon emissions cause global warming evidence consists of observations made by someone at some time computer models and theoretical calculations are not evidence they are just theory the public is eventually going to have to be told the evidence anyway so it might as well be told before wrecking the economy

5462343 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

5462350 dkos blogger devilstower in his recent front page post who really won the cold war uses this 2 year old economist article a pause in democracys march and the recent russia georgia conflict over south ossetia as context for a particularly mordant screed against capitalism i will say this devilstower is quite correct that capitalism and democracy are not necessarily coterminous indeed capitalism can function in just about any political system whether authoritarian democratic or anarchic modern anarchic systems are the underground economy i will also concede that the right libertarians a la milton friedman were a bit too optimistic in suggesting a homeomorphic relationship between capitalism and freedom however where devilstower gets it completely wrong is that he makes no distinction between state capitalism and the free market indeed he views the free market as unmitigated evil an inherently exploitative system that serves as an impediment to human rights rawlsian justice and democracy the gist of his argument can summarized very succinctly if a and b engage in voluntary trade and b does something to c that a doesnt like a will nevertheless not act against b because a does not wish to jeopardize trade with b i just have to be blunt this is a truly a d t argument if a and b are not engaged in any trade then what other recourse would a have to retaliate against b for its actions taken against c other than flat out war devilstower blames tiananmen square on the evils of free trade but as bad as tiananmen square was it paled in magnitude to the evil mass murder of maos culture revolution conducted when china was more or less completely cut off from the rest of the world what recourse did the west have to take action against mao other than invasion and war what exactly would be devilstowers enforcement mechanism the un progressives who are anti trade and yet somehow advocate strong international organizations to somehow enforce human rights are completely oblivious to the fact there would be no un if nations put up protectionist walls to cut themselves off from one another

5462357 i think that sites like rushmoredrive are inevitable if search engines refuse to cede more control of search results to users
5462358 google and other web search engines rank results objectively rather than based on user specific considerations is there a way we can give control to users and thus make the search engines objective referees rather than paternalistic gatekeepers

5462620 i thought id be able to handle it better but i was shaking i was nervous out there
5462621 i just started this sport for fun and it wasnt an olympic sport then it got into the olympics i went to three games and i have a third medal im still trying to soak it in i think
5462622 the week before the world championships i couldnt walk that took a lot and going for the surgery after those championships and coming back on a time constraint i learned to work under those deadlines
5462623 everything fell into place and im just so happy thats why this medal means so much to me because of what i had to go through this year to get to this point
5462624 hes just meant too much to me as a coach and also developing me as a person
5462625 ive just learned so much from him along the way
5462626 shes very determined and shes very consistent and those are things people should aspire to
5462627 it would be nice to get the full three different medals at the three different olympics but shes not healthy and shes not at a peak age in her career so to duplicate her result from athens is awesome
5462628 for me im totally satisfied with my athletic career i couldnt ask for more
5462629 i need to give my body a rest i dont plan on retiring from the sport right away but im not sure if ill go for another four years
5462630 but i love it so much its going to be hard for me to give it up right now im just enjoying this moment and ill make a decision later
5462631 the latest statistics we have show that 20 per cent of canadians will suffer a mental illness or disorder at some point in their lives
5462632 the stigmatization of people suffering from mental illness is a problem that is always present
5462633 this worries us greatly because of the negative consequences on peoples health
5462634 this is the part where we need to make an effort
5462635 the blame is being put on me for you and lauren drifting apart and i dont think thats fair
5462636 hes so big and so global now im sure well try to top it
5462637 we had hoped to have it end at johnny unitas stadium but that may not cut it

5462641 after going through all of the tapes i felt like bo and braden had a better understanding of the offense

5462643 i told justin hes only one or two plays away from being the guy so hes got to be ready

5462655 bruce is the best coach for the galaxy and certainly one of the best coaches in the history of the league

5462659 children are experiencing everything for the first time all their experiences are new they also have an amazingly intense vision of the world an amazing fresh perception children are incredibly awake to the world around us so time passes slowly for them
5462660 there is less novelty in our life and you become used to the world and more familiar you take in less information from the world around us and time is less stretched with information
5462661 make sure your life is as full of new experiences as possible if you live a life thats full of routine then time will always speed up but if you make an effort to travel to new environments and expose yourself to new situations new challenges even something simple like a new route to work new interests new hobbies then this degree of newness slows down time

5462669 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5462670 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5462671 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5462672 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5462673 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5462674 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5462675 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5462676 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5462677 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5462678 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5462679 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5462680 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5462681 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

5462688 we look forward to bringing in a top notch soccer coach who will work closely with the kearney and central nebraska soccer communities to build upon the existing interest level and then grow the sport
5462689 we have been impressed by the grass roots support that currently exists for soccer and we are definitely encouraged about this sports potential
5462690 it will increase opportunities for women who wish to participate in university athletics it will increase opportunities for fan participation and it is a program that has been requested repeatedly by our student body
5462691 we anticipate unk womens soccer to be extremely popular right from the first kick
5462692 soccer was the only championship sport sponsored by the nsaa nebraska school activities association not previously offered by unk many of the top feeder high schools to unk already have girls soccer programs its a championship sport sponsored by the rmac so it just makes a lot of sense to add this sport at this time
5462693 thankfully the young boy received only a minor injury however this could have been more serious
5462694 postoperative ileus inability of the intestines to pass contents is regarded as an inevitable response to the trauma of abdominal surgery and is a major contributing factor to postoperative pain and discomfort associated with abdominal distension nausea vomiting and cramping pain
5462695 postoperative length of hospital stay was assessed in four trials comprising 134 patients
5462696 this was also reduced in the chewing gum group by longer than one day however this result was not statistically significant
5462697 in conclusion we feel that the current evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of stay
5462698 the potential benefits to individual patients in health economics terms are such that a well designed large scale blinded randomized controlled trial with a placebo arm is warranted to answer the question of whether gum chewing can significantly reduce the length of stay after abdominal surgery or whether it merely represents a placebo effect
5462699 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
5462700 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
5462701 although the overall frequency of sleep insufficiency in children is unknown our studys prevalence of 26 percent may be under estimated due to the exclusion of children with known sleep disorders and other illnesses
5462702 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
5462703 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5462704 these groups already are known to be at higher risk for hypertension and other adverse outcomes
5462705 their high prevalence of poor sleep quality and deprivation could be due to disruptive home environments and neighborhoods as well as unrecognized psychological and medical problems
5462706 meanwhile pediatricians should view sleep quality and patterns as an intervenable health concern
5462707 our data underscores the need to monitor quality and quantity of sleep as part of a childs overall health strategy

5462725 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
5462726 irrigation fed agriculture provides 45 per cent of the worlds food supplies and without it we could not feed our planets population of six billion people
5462727 millions of people depend on freshwater fisheries as a major food source
5462728 freshwater food stocks can provide up to 80 per cent of dietary protein for the 60 million people of the mekong basin for example and thats just one river
5462729 freshwater systems are home to around 40 per cent of all the species on earth
5462730 and our impact is shown by the fact that we are losing these species faster than any other
5462731 a global treaty for co operatively managing rivers and lakes that cross or form borders is still languishing in limbo more than a decade after being approved by a clear majority in the united nations
5462732 water management for human needs alone is damaging the natural systems we all depend on
5462733 maintaining the health of freshwater ecosystems has to become one of the major aims of freshwater management generally
5462734 we are also concerned that the world continues to mainly discuss adaptation to climate change rather than doing it
5462735 we have been doing it all over the world and we have found that that improving the health of freshwater ecosystems now makes a great contribution to improving their resilience to climate impacts in the future
5462736 it is ironic that currently it is not foresight and planning but major natural disasters that lead to significant efforts to repair damaged rivers and wetlands foresight and planning now will reduce the risk and damage from future extreme weather events while having many economic social and environmental benefits
5462737 even this tiny proportion however would be enough for humans to live on earth if the water cycle was properly functioning and if we managed our water use wisely

5462808 there remains only one obstacle from which the enemy calls him from and this is an obstacle that he must face if anyone were to be saved from this obstacle it would have been the messengers and prophets of allah and the noblest of his creation this is the obstacle of satan unleashing his troops upon the believer with various types of harm by way of the hand the tongue and the heart this occurs in accordance with the degree of goodness that exists within the believer so the higher he is in degree the more the enemy unleashes his troops and helps them against him and overwhelms him with his followers and allies in various ways there is no way around this obstacle because the firmer he is in calling to allah and fulfilling his commands the more the enemy becomes intent upon deceiving him with foolish people so he has essentially put on his body armor in this obstacle and has taken it upon himself to confront the enemy for allahs sake and in his name and his worship in doing so is the worship of the best of worshippers

5462878 to be honest my first choice would have been to fight at the millennium stadium
5462879 the powers that be want me to fight in america hbo werent happy about running a pay per view show from outside the states and you have to go with what they say
5462880 new york is a lot closer than vegas and im sure there is plenty of christmas shopping to be done after i kick roy jones butt
5462881 you know what i talked to michael koncz and i told him you know what if manny doesnt win this fight you can keep my money you dont have to pay me thats how sure i am
5462882 the thing is some people tell me that im crazy some people tell me that mannys too small i dont believe that i honestly feel manny can beat this guy
5462883 i was shocked to hear about lung cancer and really wanted to support the rclcf and encourage more people around the country to be involved in de feet and raise funds for the campaign
5462884 mr dela hoya however has shown little interest by offering me a percentage that only an up and coming fighter rightly deserves if he really wants the fight then he should at least at the very least give me what i truly deserve a fair share of the pie he should understand that we are both superstars in the game and our mere names will sell everything and we stand to break all existing records in the sport even the one that he established with floyd mayweather
5462885 mr dela hoya this fight is going to be better than the mayweather fight because as you may already know i will not be running away from you it will be a fight for the ages even our grandkids will be talking about this match even when we are already old dont let the opportunity pass
5462886 i look forward to regaining the momentum from my last fight and continuing my quest to become a world champion
5462887 i feel physically stronger than ever fully recovered from the surgery and ready to step back into the ring at the patriot center this fall
5462888 if i can not beat this clown i do not want to get paid
5462889 this guy is a nut case if he thinks he is going to beat me
5462890 he might as well get ready to go home with a broke behind and broke bank account
5462891 it is not possible for louis turner to beat me
5462892 he is too slow and i am too slick for him i will dominate the fight and clearly win
5462893 i will stop this kid he will not last the full 8 rounds
5462894 greenidge fights a lot in atlanta and i cannot leave it to the judges i will win by ko so there will not be any questions
5462895 the nabc is proud to have such talented young boxers fighting for our world middleweight title this will be an exciting fight and we encourage everyone to go to the fight live in atlanta or watch it live on the internet by joining kokings net

5462900 our little courtyard garden seemed without limits there was buzzing from thousands of invisible bees an intoxicating aroma a warm sun as thick as honey the air flashed as though armed with swords and between the swords erect angel like insects with colourful motionless wings advanced straight for me i screamed from fright my eyes filled with tears and the world vanished
5462901 suddenly the bitter odour of carob beans tar and rotten citrons my creaking vitals opened to receive it at a turn in the street dark indigo seething all cries and smells what a beast that was what freshness what boundless sigh the entire sea poured into me frothingly my tender temples collapsed and my head filled with laughter salt and fear
5462902 i closing my eyes fell against her exposed bosom and smelled her body the warm dense perfume the acid scent of milk and sweat the newly married body was steaming i inhaled the vapour in an erotic torpor hanging from her high bosom suddenly i felt overcome by dizziness and fainted blushing terribly the frightened neighbour put me down depositing me between two pots of basil
5462903 she just looked at me very tenderly with her large eyes and smiled
5462904 i remember lifting my eyes and seeing the stars for the first time jumping to my feet i cried out in fear sparks sparks the sky seemed a vast conflagration to me my little body was on fire
5462905 which smells of sea soil and human sweat the word in order to touch me must become warm flesh

5462911 if james dean had never been born wed have more stable youth
5462912 i just wanted to see the headline thats why i didnt pick it up
5462913 although it was clear cut who the top four people were i was really pleased that so many different people got votes
5462914 we had numerous other candidates but those four separated themselves they have taken on a role on the field and are continuing to try and grow and understand their role off the field as they learn how to be captains i think it is a great tribute to requan boyette to be hurt at this time and still have his teammates trust in him and believe in his leadership
5462915 we picked four guys who want to go out and lead on and off the field
5462916 we want to go out and do the right thing on and off the field to take something from coach cutcliffe leading and winning is an all the time thing
5462917 we also believe that the decline may be attributed to the challenges we face in merchandising our expanded product lines in existing wholesale channels as well as the maturity of our core products in the consumer market and lessening demand for such product
5462918 decline in demand of certain shoe styles experienced in the second quarter
5462919 the preseason is important but i think the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off
5462920 im doing good doing good just wishing i could have been out there last night
5462921 ill try to get treatment this week im feeling better every day
5462922 training camp is very physically demanding theres some things that come up whether it be a foot or an arm
5462923 its just trying to be smart trying to understand its a long season and not going out there and aggravating something
5462924 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
5462925 cold when i am denied it your light is ultraviolet
5462926 we know that our son neil is innocent and we are devastated to learn that the evidence points to rachel murdering our grandchild and then committing suicide
5462927 each morning he rises in the souza baranowski correctional center in shirley ma will ever take away from the fact that he ruined two beautiful lives in a selfish bid to escape the crushing torture of his own design
5462928 the greatest trick the devil ever pulled off is convincing the world he doesnt exist
5462929 if you want to see gods love look at your parents
5462930 why would i bother when ive already done so many things wrong
5462931 i saw the trains run today and it was the first time to see them run i was very excited
5462932 it will transform this from a sleepy little airport to a major facility that can really efficiently move passengers around
5462933 they were wonderful that was the greatest thing since night baseball
5462934 all the time and effort and energy they spent all goes for naught and theyre going to have to start over if they are going to do anything or appeal
5462935 either way i think we are in a much much better position
5462936 any mechanism where this city can purge itself of wrongdoing
5462937 we have to abide by the order of the court well review with mr goodman all our options
5462938 i think thats the appropriate venue its been the appropriate venue all along
5462939 hurry up in there theres other people in the house you know
5462940 hey some of us have to compete in the olympics maybe you could speed it up
5462941 hey im in here all right im competing in the olympics too so maybe show a little respect to your fellow athlete
5462942 we are looking at all of this with a very fine magnifying glass to make sure we learn everything
5462943 the direction ive been given is how do we make it better so take a look at that in regards to the whole bridge not just where the accident was
5462944 i think it does give me pause to think about the two way traffic on the bridge i dont think thats very good
5462945 i dont like the two way traffic at all and i avoid it at all costs
5462946 this is the place i want you to go and these are the people i want you to reach out to
5462947 i am not sure how clark will play with the crowd over at the nation or the daily kos or on george soros trading floor any thoughts
5462948 i turn off my phone at night dont most people who arent either priests or paramedics
5462949 sim e o que isso tem a ver com entrenimento
5462950 despite an increasingly difficult enterprise spending environment in the u s and parts of europe reasonable growth expectations strength in emerging countries currency and product cycles should be enough to drive some upside for each company
5462951 i think chinas just kind of a who knows its so hot it has to come down eventually
5462952 even if china goes from 25 percent to 15 percent year over year growth it can cause some volatility
5462953 youre going to hear notebooks doing well for both companies
5462954 i think that hp continues to be very upbeat about what it can do with eds and will go to great lengths on the conference call to convince people of that
5462955 share gains on the inkjet side combined with stronger emerging market growth on the laser side should drive another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth in printers and operating margin above 15 percent
5462956 even against a tough comparison we expect hp to maintain double digit pc revenue growth on strength outside of the u s
5462957 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth
5462958 what we expected to find is that the migration to ipv6 is slow
5462959 we saw a flat proportion of ipv4 to ipv6 over the course of the year
5462960 so although in aggregate ipv6 did grow its growing at about the same level that general internet traffic is growing
5462961 we have some monitoring in asia but we would like to see more there obviously iekel johnson admitted
5462962 its not quite as comprehensive as the european and north american measurements
5462963 in general we agree with the findings of the report issued today
5462964 it seems comprehensive and we appreciate the value of these types of studies as they help raise awareness and understanding of critical industry issues
5462965 we see press releases from lots of providers across the world talking about ipv6 readiness or infrastructure deployed and im sure its all true it just doesnt seem like anyone is using it
5462966 its a slow moving train and there is no perception that there is an immediate problem so there is nothing motivating the switch
5462967 i should be training with the team on tuesday i am really glad that is not a bad injury i am looking forward to joining in training tomorrow and getting on with playing
5462968 but i think it would be fantastic if i got the chance to play in spain or england
5462969 steven took a knock to his knee yesterday in training so as a precautionary measure we just thought it was better that he sit out the session this evening
5462970 we will review the situation tomorrow but the expectation at this stage is that he will resume training tomorrow
5462971 i will remain faithful to the nation and my countrymen and promise in the name of the people that i will remain faithful to the sovereign nation of nepal
5462972 the priority is to take this peace process to a logical end
5462973 i will also create an environment conducive to constitution drafting which will be our first priority
5462974 we are in talks with members of the alliance and will form a government as soon as possible
5462975 we have to restructure the state people have high hopes for us and we will not let the people down
5462976 how the vacuum is handled by the civilian government how much control they can exercise on the radical elements remains to be seen
5462977 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5462978 india will continue to have an amicable relation with pakistan in the days to come
5462979 such a show of violence is pushing kashmiri people especially our youth toward revolution
5462980 at this point i think the international community has to step in otherwise we fear a growing extremism this kind of anger comes at the worst time
5462981 pakistan has to put its political house in order before we can say what it means for kashmir
5462982 we would probably wait and see what ukraines response is what the eu u s and natos response is then we would try to draw up a new balance sheet which takes these things into consideration

5462985 in order to ensure continued future growth of stella artois across the world inbev will organize a pitch for the global stella artois creative account
5462986 our relationship with lowe over the past 25 years has been unique and very successful and they have been a key partner in achieving continued growth of stella artois across the world
5462987 through the years weve applied ruthlessly high standards to the quality of work weve produced for stella artois
5462988 compromise is a word you would never hear at lowe regarding this brand and we are exceptionally proud of the work that resulted from that approach we have worked with some great people at inbev and wish the brand well into the future
5462989 in conclusion we feel that the evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of stay
5462990 the potential benefits to individual patients in health economics terms are such that a well designed large scale blinded randomized controlled trial with a placebo arm is warranted to answer the question of whether gum chewing can significantly reduce the length of stay after abdominal surgery or whether it merely represents a placebo effect
5462991 karena itu salah satu buku yang menginspirasi saya untuk selalu optimis sama apapun
5462992 a las autoridades no les importan las desapariciones o cr menes de mujeres ya que silencian los casos como si fueran personas de segunda clase pero los feminicidios siguen
5462993 los asesinos de mujeres siguen en las calles y los tres niveles de gobierno no le dan importancia a estos casos
5462994 existe desesperaci n y miedo de las familias de vivir en tal inseguridad al ver a las hijas salir del hogar sin saber si van a regresar no son motivo para la voluntad de alguien para que ponga freno a estos hechos y a la fecha estos cr menes est n impunes y a las mujeres desaparecidas nadie las busca
5462995 i am extremely happy for my friend jantuah for beating ricardo and hope and pray that he will continue to train hard for the realization of his dreams of becoming an undefeated world champion

5463000 there will be animals in heaven heaven defined as the entirety of the afterlife of the righteous including a restored earth in a different condition than they experience in this life and passages describing the afterlife sometimes either refer to animals there or use references to animals to convey a point isaiah 66 20 romans 8 19 23 revelation 19 11 14
5463001 there are alternative initially plausible and yet mutually inconsistent ways of interpreting the holy scriptures
5463002 is outside the range of our knowledge god has given us data which enable us in some degree to understand our own suffering he has given us no such data about beasts we know neither why they were made nor what they are and everything we say about them is speculative
5463003 we can glimpse only that aspect of gods purpose for his world that directly concerns ourselves
5463004 from the doctrine that god is good we may confidently deduce that the appearance of reckless divine cruelty in the animal kingdom is an illusion
5463005 either animals have souls or they have no souls if they have none pain is felt for which there can be no moral responsibility and for which no misuse of gods gift of moral freedom can be invoked as an excuse if they have souls we can give no plausible account a of their immortality i e how to draw the line between animals with souls and men with souls or b of their moral corruption
5463006 the hypothesis that the animals were corrupted by man does not account for animal pain during the hundreds of millions of years when the earth contained living creatures but did not contain man
5463007 las mujeres eran culpables de las violaciones cuando se vest an de forma atractiva
5463008 in the last five years theyve moved away from the old health promotion model into looking at what can they do in the organization to reduce the stress
5463009 god we long to hear these six words well done my god and faithfull servant
5463010 relentlessly hunted down a doctor who would perform the irreversible surgery
5463011 having children is selfish its all about maintaining your genetic line at the expense of the planet
5463012 every person who is born uses more food more water more land more fossil fuels more trees and produces more rubbish more pollution more greenhouse gases and adds to the problem of over population
5463013 when i finished school i got a job in retail and at 19 i met my first husband
5463014 no sooner had we finished our wedding cake than all our relatives started to ask when they could expect a new addition to the family
5463015 i always told them that would never happen but no one listened
5463016 when i was a child i loved bird watching and in my teens that developed into a passion for the environment as well as the welfare of animals i became a vegetarian when i was 15
5463017 even my parents used to smile and say youll change your mind one day about babies
5463018 the only person who understood how i felt was my first husband who didnt want children either
5463019 we both passionately wanted to save the planet not produce a new life which would only add to the problem
5463020 when i was 21 i considered sterilisation for the first time
5463021 id been on the pill for five years and didnt want to take hormone based contraception indefinitely
5463022 i went to my gp but she wouldnt even consider the idea
5463023 she said i was far too young and told me i could absolutely not be sterilised and that i was bound to change my mind one day
5463024 we decided my husband would have a vasectomy instead he was 25 just a few years older than me but the gp allowed him to go ahead
5463025 i found it insulting that she thought that just because i was a woman id reach a point where an urge to breed would overcome all rational thought
5463026 through my job i made many friends who like me were more interested in campaigning trying to change society and save the planet rather than having families of our own
5463027 we used to say that if ever we did want children wed adopt as there are so many children in need of a loving family
5463028 at least then wed be doing something positive for the world rather than something negative
5463029 i discovered that despite taking the pill id accidentally fallen pregnant by my boyfriend
5463030 i was horrified i knew straight away there was no option of having the baby
5463031 i went to my doctor about having a termination and asked if i could be sterilised at the same time
5463032 this time it was a male doctor i remember saying to him i want to make sure this never happens again
5463033 he said you may not want a child but one day you may meet a man who does he refused to consider it
5463034 i didnt like having a termination but it would have been immoral to give birth to a child that i felt strongly would only be a burden to the world
5463035 ive never felt a twinge of guilt about what i did and have honestly never wondered what might have been
5463036 after my abortion i was more determined than ever to pursue sterilisation
5463037 by then i had my mothers support she realised i wasnt going to grow out of my beliefs and was proud of my campaigning work
5463038 my new gp was more forward thinking and referred me to hospital i couldnt wait for the operation
5463039 a week before my sterilisation i went to an animal rights demonstration and met ed
5463040 i liked him immediately and i told him what i was doing straight away because if he wanted children then he needed to know i wasnt the woman for him
5463041 but ed was relieved when i told him how i felt and said he didnt want children for the same reasons
5463042 after the operation which is irreversible i didnt feel emotional just relieved
5463043 ive never doubted that i made the right decision ed and i married in september 2002 and have a much nicer lifestyle as a result of not having children
5463044 we love walking and hiking and we often go away for weekends
5463045 every year we also take a nice holiday weve just come back from south africa
5463046 we feel we can have one long haul flight a year as we are vegan and childless thereby greatly reducing our carbon footprint and combating over population
5463047 my only frustration is that other people are unable to accept my decision
5463048 when i tell people why i dont want children they look at me as if i was planning to commit murder
5463049 a woman who does not have maternal feelings is seen as some sort of anomaly
5463050 and a woman like me who is not having children in order to save the planet is considered barking mad
5463051 what i consider mad are those women who ferry their children short distances in gas guzzling cars
5463052 i realised then that a baby would pollute the planet and that never having a child was the most environmentally friendly thing i could do
5463053 ive had boyfriends who wanted children so i knew i couldnt be with them long term says sarah
5463054 ive had to break up with a couple of boyfriends because i didnt think it was fair to waste their time
5463055 in my early 20s i had a boyfriend who i really liked but he wanted to start a family as soon as possible
5463056 i was tempted to stay with him and hope he would change his mind but i knew i couldnt provide him with what he wanted so i walked away
5463057 to my relief mark was as adamant as me that he didnt want a family after a year of dating we started talking about sterilisation
5463058 i didnt want to have an accident if contraception didnt work we would be faced with the dilemma of whether to keep the baby
5463059 we realised it was a much more straightforward procedure safer and easier for a man to be sterilised through a vasectomy than a woman to be sterilised
5463060 in january 2005 mark had a vasectomy and we both felt incredibly relieved there was no chance of us having a baby
5463061 we both have nieces who we love dearly and i consider myself a caring nurturing person
5463062 my sister recently had a little girl and that has taken the pressure off me because my parents wanted to be grandparents
5463063 at first they were surprised by my decision but they have never criticised us
5463064 id never dream of preaching to others about having a family its a very personal choice what i do like to do is make people aware of the facts
5463065 when i see a mother with a large family i dont resent her but i do hope shes thought through the implications
5463066 sarah and i live as green a life a possible we dont have a car cycle everywhere instead and we never fly
5463067 we recycle use low energy light bulbs and eat only organic locally produced food
5463068 in short we do everything we can to reduce our carbon footprint but all this would be undone if we had a child
5463069 when we love a sap older than time rises through our arms

5463076 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
5463077 i know you ive read your stuff you and arn and all those other guys
5463078 ms jones has done a tremendous job over the past few years administering the instructional program at greene central high school
5463079 greene central is definitely in capable hands i am excited about the possibilities for the future at our comprehensive high school

5463081 i know you ive read your stuff you and arn and all those other guys
5463082 its incredibly important that these incidents are not beyond the law it certainly would be a step in the right direction if the us would go ahead and bring charges

5463089 now a deputy sheriff brings me the police report this community we couldnt have this paper without them when people call up and ask can you cover such and such i have to tell them no but if you take a picture and bring in a write up well run it thats what its all about at this point
5463090 the editorial page editor the food editor the features editor and if you can think of any other editors im them too
5463091 its a good way to meet people and get to know your community
5463092 all the sane people in the county live north of the tar yeah and all the crazy people live south of the tar
5463093 first of all its not a health food a hot dog has gotta have grease then you gotta have a steamed bun with the mustard on the bottom that sorta waterproofs the bun then you put in your hot dog next the onions a hot dog without onions is just not worth eating then the chili next so the grease goes down and finally you put the homemade slaw on top and its incredible
5463094 now heres how you know if youve got a good hot dog you know how they wrap em in that wax paper and put em in a brown paper bag well when you carry that bag out to the car and put it in on the car seat by the time you get back if you dont have grease on your car seat then you dont have a good hot dog and thats a fact
5463095 i had a double cheeseburger my way with mustard chili onion slaw and dill pickles it was nirvana never known by any fast food chain every bite was a sloppy juicy heavenly mouthful of flavor with real cooked to order fresh hand patted hamburger

5463104 f hrt man mit 50 km h auf die kreuzung zu hat man nur intuitiv die m glichkeit sich auf einer der drei spuren richtig einzuordnen nicht aber gleichzeitig den wegweiser zu lesen
5463105 jeder unsichere fahrer ist ein unfallfaktor mehr fahren sie mal mit den augen eines m ncheners ber den ring sie werden hoffnungslos berfordert sein
5463106 sie werden keinen finden der den berliner platz heute nochmal so bauen w rde
5463107 f r einen sicheren stra enverkehr ist es erforderlich die aufmerksamkeit der autofahrer nicht durch zu viele informationen auf zu vielen schildern zu berfrachten

5463109 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5463110 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5463111 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5463112 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5463113 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5463114 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5463115 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5463116 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5463117 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5463118 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5463119 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5463120 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5463121 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5463122 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5463126 the forgotten man a new history of the great depression
5463127 perverse monetary policy was the greatest cause of the great depression
5463128 but there were five other mistakes in the 1930s that some politicians today seem ready to repeat
5463129 the proximate danger today is a repeat of the 1970s not the 1930s but if lawmakers dont remember the old missteps they might find that their new recovery legislation imperils our recovery
5463130 theres speculation that barack obama might choose his running mate sometime this week before the democratic convention begins
5463131 joe biden making a very interesting trip abroad to the country of georgia in the middle of this conflict with russia right now really showing off his strong suit with his credentials foreign policy diplomacy knows a lot of foreign leaders
5463132 straight out of central casting evan bayh looks like you know if you could made a hollywood movie about the guy who was going to be the vice president hes a good politician
5463133 walking the dog last night a friend of mine says chuck hagel chuck hagel chuck hagel any chance chuck hagel
5463134 well i dont think so you have him right next to tom ridge we can talk about in a minute chuck hagel pro life for a democrat very hard to pick a pro lifer
5463135 because he floats this trial balloon with tom ridge last week tom ridge who is pro choice
5463136 i think its an iron law with these picks for both parties democrats its got to be a pro choicer republicans its got to be a pro lifer even though they say their open minded and its a big tent i dont think it works that way
5463137 well you know mccain and romney had a very nasty primary fight wound up not liking each other that much
5463138 might bring mccain some badly needed credibility on the economy
5463139 pawlenty governor of minnesota you know meat and potatoes guy kind of a populist thing get in touch with ordinary voters
5463140 didnt win his last election by very many votes though
5463141 john mccain has to find a balance though between someone whos young enough to give him a little more spunk when hes out on the trail but whos ready to take over right away
5463142 shes the lieutenant governor of alaska and she is young shes been a reformer but she also has conservative credentials
5463143 but if youre going to talk about putting a woman on the ticket mccain wants to appeal to some of those old hillary voters someone whos not up here carly fiorina she is one of his top surrogates former executive at hewlett packard and that could be a very interesting choice
5463144 sarah palin a lot of viewers maybe familiar with her
5463145 but i saw a man yesterday who knows a fellow who had it from a chappie that said that urquhart had been dipping himself a bit recklessly off the deep end
5463146 tear down theory poetic systems no more rules no more models genius conjures up rather than learns
5463147 we have met with families in which for weeks together not an article of sustenance but potatoes had been used yet for every child the hard earned sum was provided to send them to school
5463148 when we began first to preach these things the people appeared as awakened from the sleep of ages they seemed to see for the first time that they were responsible beings
5463149 all of a sudden we now had a rule book to go by and when we had problems the preacher was right there to give us the answers
5463150 no you have to go if you start an uprising here youll be caught and theyll implant units in all our heads your effort will be for naught please go ill help free the others in due time

5463228 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products
5463229 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5463230 is not something we can negotiate bilaterally with the united states
5463231 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued technological development in the information technology industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers
5463232 michael jordan is the best athlete in the world not only for how he played the game but for all he did to grow the sport of basketball

5463242 it was long ago and far away in a prison camp in north vietnam my father was a high ranking admiral the vietnamese came and said that i could leave prison early and we had a code of conduct that said you only leave by order of capture i also had a dear and beloved friend who was from california by the name of ed alvarez who had been shot down and captured a couple years before me but i wasnt in good physical shape in fact i was in rather bad physical shape
5463243 so i said no now in interest of full disclosure im very happy i didnt know the war was going to last for another three years or so but i said no and ill never forget the high ranking officer who offered it slammed the door and the interrogator said go back to your cell its going to be very tough on you now and it was but it was not only the toughest decision i ever made but im most happy about that decision than any decision ive ever made in my life it took a lot of prayer it took a lot of prayer

5463251 this will go a long way in aligning the interest of lenders with the best interest of homeowners
5463252 we proudly sell coffee brewed with fair trade coffee beans acquired at a price that permits sustainable farming and pays growers a living wage
5463253 many small coffee farmers receive prices for their coffee that are less than the costs of production forcing them into a cycle of poverty and debt
5463254 our ultimate goal is that all coffee purchased be fair trade coffee so that all growers will receive the higher fair trade price
5463255 in the 1970s the united states agency for international development usaid gave over 80 million to coffee plantations in latin america to modernize to strip coffee of shade trees and purchase chemical pesticides and fertilizers
5463256 bigger problem is highly subsidized farmers in wealthy countries huge subsidies to farmers in parts of the west mean that farmers in poor countries cannot diversify their production because they cannot access these markets poor farmers choose to produce coffee cocoa and other commodities because they have few other options with which to generate income

5463263 nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing
5463264 never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity

5463279 they have a board meeting in london on tuesday to discuss the issue the meeting lasted two hours and it was an opportunity for all the players to ask whatever questions they had about the tournament
5463280 david collier and hugh morris managing director of the england team were both there and they heard the views of all the players
5463281 they will report back to the ecb board on tuesday but i dont know when a decision is going to be announced

5463286 dane county has a serious problem there are not enough assistant district attorneys to handle the ever increasing caseload in order for the system to process cases in a timely effective and fair manner the state of wisconsin must authorize a sufficient number of new attorney positions in the district attorneys office this is by far the most important need of the justice system
5463287 if adas had more time to spend on each case we would be able to find better innovative case dispositions
5463288 maintaining law and order in our communities requires effective policing and prosecution
5463289 as wisconsins largest law enforcement group we implore our elected leaders to heed the advice of the legislative audit bureau and increase the number of prosecutors in this state wisconsinites can no longer afford the detrimental impact that the shortfall of prosecutors has on our criminal justice system
5463290 we continue to prioritize our work and seek every efficiency we can think of
5463291 but once you are down to having only minutes per case the quality of justice is imperiled
5463292 that is an example of strong action to address genuine needs in the criminal justice system but dna analysis is only one part of the criminal justice process prompt dna work is not worth much if there is not also prompt prosecution work in the states courthouses

5463300 tegen de sterke landen moeten we hopen dat we zo lang mogelijk bij ze kunnen blijven om uiteindelijk met een kleine score te winnen
5463301 daarvoor hebben we voorlopig te veel punten opgegeven de zege van vandaag hadden we wel even nodig hopelijk cre ert het een bepaald gevoel bij de jongens waardoor we meer van de kleine kansen gaan benutten
5463302 ik zou het leuk vinden de koningin de ontmoeten en ik denk dat de speelsters gebrand zijn op een verrassing
5463303 het was ons eerste doel maar het was ook een verrassing voor de meeste speelsters daarom zijn ze zo blij hier te zijn

5463305 the pre season is important but i think the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off

5463310 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5463311 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5463312 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5463313 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5463314 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5463315 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5463316 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up

5463320 on oil alone canada has been the largest supplier to the u s since 1999 not saudi arabia not kuwait nor any other producer from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries
5463321 canada is a stable supplier of energy to the u s whether it is gas and oil in the west or integrated electricity grids in the east
5463322 and being close means lower delivery costs than most other power suppliers
5463323 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century

5463331 we feel like there are so many unanswered questions we would like to have specific answers to those questions
5463332 we are opposing this rate increase because it is not justified under tennessee law
5463333 because thats the additional amount that it takes to cover our cost of service cost of service is what this is about
5463334 tennessee american has written off 1 1 billion since 2003 and has undertaken an aggressive campaign to raise rates across the u s with its operating companies
5463335 i have decided that in this time of budget deficits for the state i dont think it is right to accept a full time salary for what should be a part time job
5463336 i just thought how could somebody do this its just wrong
5463337 i guess you could call it mischievous behavior but the amount of damage done really went well beyond that scale

5463341 no no you have to lay down until 7 but you can stay in here
5463342 he arrived about five minutes before the show started and stood next to the soundboard
5463343 he was wearing a yankees baseball hat and trying no to be noticed he was really into the show you could tell he was really focused on her
5463344 this is something he has never hidden thankfully his condition is very mild and at worst manifests itself in an inability to tie his shoelaces and bad handwriting
5463345 our party has been a majority party for a long time we are the party of opportunity we are an inclusive accepting party if you look at folks of color even women they are more successful in the democrat party than they are in the white i mean the republican party
5463346 we are incredibly happy healthy and very much together here in los angeles recording our new record
5463347 besides this ridiculously overblown lawsuit we are having one of the most inspiring wonderful and exciting times that weve experienced to date
5463348 so as you may have heard we are being sued by our former record company for the ridiculously oversized totally unrealistic and pretty silly but slightly clever sum of 30 000 000 insane yea thats what we said too
5463349 preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion
5463350 all of us in new york hollywood and across the country should be concerned about how this failure to reach an agreement is impacting our members
5463351 they have already suffered significantly as a result of the writers guild of america strike and now they are experiencing an additional loss of work made worse when they can find a job by having to work without a contract under old terms and conditions
5463352 there are some who feel we have all the time in the world to make this deal
5463353 this advisory motion is not in the best interests of new york division sag members or any sag members across the country
5463354 it could delay and prolong the negotiations by emboldening management with a false belief that sag actors are split on the issues
5463355 nothing is happening and we are no closer to a deal than we were six weeks ago
5463356 sag and amptp full committees which combined number over 100 people will meet face to face again when we have reached a deal and shake hands across the table we are all hopeful that will happen soon
5463357 claims by sags negotiators about informal talks are no more true today than they were when first made two weeks ago
5463358 negotiations concluded when the producers presented their final offer on june 30 and no meetings are scheduled
5463359 mediation is an option available any time the parties mutually agree to it
5463360 mediation does not guarantee that negotiations will accelerate to an agreement and often has slowed the process down as recently seen in the wga negotiations which included mediation
5463361 it has not up to this point been viewed as something the parties feel would facilitate an agreement
5463362 all of the new media terms in the producers final offer including those related to original new media programs are subject to a sunset clause that protects both performers and producers by allowing the two sides to reevaluate all of the new media terms in three years and bargain from a point of greater knowledge about the markets development
5463363 every effort by sags negotiators to reopen these talks to fundamentally alter the new media terms and make unreasonable economic demands has been flatly and consistently rejected by the producers at every level of these talks the amptps position on its final offer could not be any clearer and no amount of dead of the night emails by sag leaders is going to change the fundamental facts

5463367 a naval arms limitation agreement negotiated to demilitarize the great lakes and lake champlain after the war of 1812 this convention was concluded between the united states and great britain represented respectively by richard rush and charles bagot in 1817 under its terms each country agreed to dismantle all armed vessels on the lakes with the exception of four retained for policing purposes and to construct no new warships during the 19th century there were occasional infractions of the terms and during the second world war they were somewhat modified but the spirit of the convention has in general never been violated still technically in force the rush bagot agreement has become a symbol of the long standing peaceful relations between canada and the united states
5463368 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain

5463384 once we understood that no threat was perceived out of there in the key central georgia city of gori
5463385 i would like to distinguish two notions the notion of withdrawal and that of pullout
5463386 so in a telephone conversation between our president and french president nicolas sarkozy they spoke only about the pullout i hope you notice the subtlety we are not talking about withdrawal here
5463387 there is no indication to us that they have begun to pull back

5463521 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth
5463522 theyre very high growth economies but theyre still subject to volatility
5463523 i think chinas just kind of a who knows its so hot it has to come down eventually
5463524 even if the shanghai composite index is down about 50 percent this year and no
5463525 youre going to hear notebooks doing well for both companies
5463526 i think that hp continues to be very upbeat about what it can do with eds and will go to great lengths on the conference call to convince people of that

5463530 the u s is obviously still a very important region for these companies
5463531 people know its weak but does it get worse i would argue even the u s business has not been as bad as people have said
5463532 i wanted a fantastic sounding version of the famed rooftop show void of the lengthy in between chatter without the occasional sound anomalies like volume fluctuations for example in a nice concise package
5463533 one after 909 is a pleasure to hear and leaves a taste for more
5463534 we fear that the settlements may exclude a significant number of investors
5463535 regional brokers had at best limited access to information regarding the deteriorating liquidity condition in the auction rate securities market in late 2007 and early 2008

5463542 i know i was going 2 000 mph in a school zone officer i guess i just misjudged by a factor of one hundred cant you let me off with a warning
5463543 man this is like a bad day at a stock car race shouldnt we stop
5463544 and get caught up in that bureaucratic nightmare is that what junior johnson wouldve done at daytona
5463545 it is the right course of action at the first sign of trouble otherwise youll spill your beer
5463546 when i drove thrust 2 to the record in 1983
5463547 frankly as a team we were damned lucky to get away with it the car was within 7 mph of takeoff and with the huge dynamic pressures involved it would have gone upwards at 40g
5463548 the receptionist at the shell office looked a little surprised when i struggled through the door with the model case and flip charts
5463549 she opened the door to his office and said mr
5463550 i trotted through the door with my dog and pony show
5463551 i took a deep breath and blurted out in one sentence i think no sir mr
5463552 he looked up in bewilderment took off his glasses and said youve got ten minutes
5463553 if there is a divine purpose in jafr it is that god has placed it on earth as a warning of what hell is like
5463554 they wanted to escape from their misery and the stars were too far for them
5463555 was the chinese description of the dual elements of physical devastation and psychological terror the mongols appropriated the technology for use in their conquests of baghdad and from there rocketry spread into europe as the dark ages gave way to the renaissance sir isaac newton solved the theorem of equal and opposite reactions which became his third law of motion and a pithy explanation of how a rocket generates altitude and velocity this is the stuff of unmanned rockets built from the blood of indentured hebrews subjugated into aiding the third reich as it bombed the shit out of london in its quest to establish a master race of the space race and the rocket to the moon with spacemen in aluminum suits establishing beachheads on extra terra firma this is the stuff of our id and a jungian subconsciousness of
5463556 for my next act i will set myself a fire
5463557 is that constant squeaking squealing and honking the soundtrack to our entire existence nowadays
5463558 its amazing the stress these top fuel guys are subjecting these aluminum engines to
5463559 the same engines that chrysler built for their street machines back in 63 or 64
5463560 too bad they melt after four or five seconds of use
5463561 we live in a time and place of entropy where you can blow very expensive shit up and laugh about it as long as you keep it between the guardrails
5463562 the inertia of any system is the result of the interaction of that system with the rest of the universe in other words every particle in the universe ultimately has an effect on every other particle
5463563 every particle in the universe ultimately has an effect on every other particle
5463564 come friday and anybody with any sense was in full lawrence of arabia mode with goggles scarves and arab headgear much in evidence and it was needed since a sandstorm was now in full flight and showed no sign up giving up even for the benefit of a handful of brits far from home who just wanted to run a jet car
5463565 time was slipping away as the weather got worse and worse
5463566 with no chance of conditions improving until early 1997 there was no option but to pack up return to the uk and plan for 1997 so part one of the attack on the sound barrier was over plan as you may there are some things you cant control and the weather is one of them these were the worst conditions since 1991 and youd have thought that the middle east was the one place on earth safest from such conditions but then again this is record breaking and record breaking always attracts bad weather
5463567 everything was going well and the record appeared to be in the bag when suddenly at a speed of more than 200 m p h the weakened rear tire blew out the black hawk swerved to the left skidded for several hundred feet then jumped into the air in three great leaps frank lockhart was not strapped in and he was catapulted out of the car the unconscious driver was dead when he reached halifax county hospital the record set by ray keech still stood
5463568 the real trailblazers were the ones at daytona eyston and cobb and them guys
5463569 the concept that sensory data color space time tone comprise the limits of ones world now the question is why when he was mainly interested in such considerations as this was he also interested in the flow of air over moving objects at high speeds
5463570 the fewer limits to your very existence if color space time and tone are the limits of our experience speed is a means to break through those limits
5463571 the sound of the bullet is as damaging as the ripped flesh from the bullet
5463572 that is the damage of fear i dont know why ernst mach was interested in the flow of gasses over moving objects but i do know he used a bullet
5463573 to me the great irony is that the human guided devices that either broke the sound barrier or gave it the ol college try were bullet shaped
5463574 holds the steering yoke vertically 90 degrees off axis and aims the front of the car between his third and fourth knuckle like a sight on a revolver
5463575 the rocket engines exhaust is 4 times the speed of sound a noise like an afterburner kicks in and suddenly he is off riding on the head of a bullet
5463576 these guys have cars that will run all day long they dont have to do a massive amount of maintenance on them
5463577 you know running a gas dragster now but trying to put together a rocket car for exhibition
5463578 well thats funny cause a friend of mine ray dausman and i had just finished building a twenty five pound thrust rocket engine
5463579 it was in very sad shape with holes punched into it a lot of missing panels the wrong tail cone and was basically gutted
5463580 upon arrival we were pretty disappointed in the condition of the aircraft but we were certainly proud owners of this beast
5463581 we werent sure which aircraft we had because there was so much paint and graffiti all over the aircraft you couldnt tell what its number was
5463582 this aint a beer gut this is a fuel tank for a sex machine
5463583 sepulveda and venice across the street from the shell station
5463584 one night at the clock craig breedlove was draggin it out in some guys 3 window deuce
5463585 craig crashed out by the railroad tracks and just about broke his friggin neck
5463586 we thought he was dead until the guy who owned the deuce called the police and an ambulance
5463587 eventually he ended up driving for john peters and nye frank for awhile in 1962 two blown and injected small block chevies they called the car the freight train the whole crew wore engineers hats
5463588 i used to race breedlove on the streets on the westside of los angeles
5463589 but that was before he climbed into that wienie roaster and went out to the salt
5463590 youre the first to go 400 500 600 mph you havent reaped the benefits of the 400 500 600 yet
5463591 sure you can trust the government just ask an indian
5463592 the sound of a well tuned v8 is the sound of the universe at peace with itself
5463593 it is the perfect rhythm section for a twangin guitar
5463594 it sounds like you are down on compression in the number seven cylinder
5463595 a bonafide hillbilly guitar player cant get a job in county music no more
5463596 and all of those famous stock car boys cant talk about their vacations in the big house neither
5463597 every time i went to a drive in movie theater in the deep south and i saw these beach movies with dragsters racing alongside those majestic mountains or whenever i heard a song by the beach boys on my am radio i knew there was something going on in california i needed to experience
5463598 things move both forward and backwards as a function of space and time but things move my friends stars move galaxies move everything moves away from everything else and the further away they get uh the faster they move which indicates the universe is expanding and constantly changing only when something ceases to move does it cease to exist can i get an amen uhh
5463599 endeavor to prove the supremacy of british workmanship and material
5463600 1965 at bonneville i made friends with the mobil oil guy and mentioned we needed some nitro he said i have some there was a corrugated tin shed in back of the texaco station that he had a key to he gave me the key and said help yourself to what you want i had bob knapps chevy pickup and when i opened the door there was about 60 drums of fuel in the shed left over from john cobbs land speed run i thought about all of the racers that parked next to the shed over the years and never knew what was in it seeing as how he said to help ourselves and i was by myself i found a stack of pallets i put one down and rolled a barrel onto it then up onto two and so on up to the bed of the truck i got two drums of nitro and one alcohol before i could no longer move stuff was still good from 1948
5463601 i felt i knew enough about driving at very high speeds to tell that graham driving his car through only two wheels could not hope to deliver enough horsepower to the salt to go more than 355 mph i got up at the crack of dawn on august 1 and went out to have a look at the course
5463602 i tried to point out that he had changed the car radically since that time and that the surface of the salt changes almost from hour to hour
5463603 i had an allison aircraft engine for ten years and i couldnt get to 200 in the 1 4 mile
5463604 i was financially strapped even if you could afford the merlins aircraft engines or what have you the costs of developing the transmissions and the gear trains and so on and so forth were really prohibitive when i saw the jet engine i went oh boy theres no way we can go wrong with that in 61 we located a j47 engine at airmotive surplus down on alameda street in l a
5463605 they had a whole batch of em coming in that were korean war vintage the engines were being scrapped out for 500 i had a sponsor ed perkins who had an aircraft fastener company i talked ed out of 500 bucks and that became the first engine for the
5463606 for my next act i will set myself a fire
5463607 when breedlove went 500 he told goodyear they could go ahead and put their ads out because the green monster was about as aerodynamic as the side of a barn and i would never go that fast
5463608 we do not ride on the railroads it rides on us
5463609 i shared a room with walt sheehan breedloves engineer from lockheed he would bring the paper reels out of the recorder the car had a recorder that was connected to strain gauges the same thing they would use as if it were an airplane test project in those days what you would do is develop those reels just like it was a photographic negative so we had to beat it back to the motel room take our showers and convert the bathroom into a dark room and use the bathtub to develop the print out for that days run and from that extrapolate what needed to done to take the next higher step
5463610 a pure thought thing which can not be pointed to in experience
5463611 i dont remember nothing until they tried to get me out of the wreckage
5463612 hes got er on two wheels and hes heading right toward
5463613 we dont want a lot of downforce because it creates drag
5463614 but could your low weight low drag and low downforce approach a combination rather vulnerable to powerful crosswinds a phenomenon that is rampant in the desert outback of nevada is that the right way to go
5463615 anytime you walk away from a 675 mph crash you have to say well you did most of the things right
5463616 in my mind i had no thought that there was any crosswind condition whatsoever
5463617 we had called down for wind condition earlier and it was at 1 5 the timing wasnt ready and we already had the engine fired but they said shut down so i was all ready to go i actually sat in the car for forty minutes waiting for the timing to get back on we re fired the engine and had a compressor shake so we had to shut down and check for that then re lit again in the meantime the weather conditions had changed it had gone from a nice bright sunny morning to big dark clouds and i was having trouble even seeing the course
5463618 there were some decisions made because of the weather closing in that were just not prudent decisions i kind of caught up in the mode
5463619 when i called chuck just before leaving the starting line i asked was the course clear because we had a problem with policing the course when charlie came on and said the wind was at one five i thought one five okay one point five
5463620 the other problem of course was that the car was much faster than we had anticipated i was trying to watch where my mile marker was trying to look at a digital speedometer the size of a postage stamp and back off the afterburners while trying to figure how long i need to stay out of the engine and when i could go back in
5463621 i had dirt in the windshield and i really couldnt see what was happening i thought id probably had it that this was going to be it

5463635 a few years ago beekeepers all over the u s started losing more bees than they would normally lose every year a 10 to 15 percent loss thats pretty normal
5463636 some of these guys all of a sudden started losing 40 percent or 50 percent some even higher than that as it got more widespread all over the u s we realized we had some new problem we hadnt had in the past
5463637 i believe it has just become too much for the bees you hear the bees just disappear i dont believe theyre disappearing i believe the adult bees arent living as long as they used to their lifespan is being shortened and they die off when theyre in flight theyre not getting back
5463638 the cosmetics industry has borrowed a page from the playbook of the tobacco industry by putting profits ahead of public health
5463639 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5463640 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5463641 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5463642 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5463643 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5463644 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5463645 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5463646 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that
5463647 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that
5463648 on the other hand are the people of this country the business community and there too i dont see any new initiatives
5463649 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5463650 whatever one might say it may be difficult for the politicians to give him the indemnity
5463651 while 61 of americans say the effects of global warming have already begun
5463652 every time ive compromised ive lost when i held firm i won the problem with too many environmentalists today is that they are trying to write the compromise instead of letting those we pay to compromise do it they think they get power by taking people to lunch or being taken to lunch when in reality they are only being taken
5463653 we believe our actions served the best interest of justice
5463654 well everyone understands the meaning of justice and thats all were going to say
5463655 it sure looks like these groups simply wanted to avoid the politically explosive issue of cove mallard
5463656 the betrayal of the wilderness society on this point is devastating
5463657 if the country need lumber and timber jobs the cove mallard isnt such a bad place to get it
5463658 the northern rockies chapter of the sierra club which covers all of idaho and some of eastern washington never opposed timber sales in the cove mallard because the area is mostly flat
5463659 basically the intent of the task force was to expedite timber sales in idaho roadless areas by circumventing nepa
5463660 gehrke and baird were there to put a green stamp on illegal timber sales
5463661 we trust the forest service to abide by the law
5463662 did this voluntarily we didnt want to come between working people and their jobs
5463663 sometimes youve got to come promise in the face of political reality
5463664 maybe the lawsuit was ill timed considering the new political atmosphere
5463665 but it was a good suit a necessary action giving up the injunction so quickly sent the worst possible political and legal message
5463666 salmon arent endangered there are cans of them on the shelf at albertsons
5463667 i dont want to pick a fight with these guys
5463668 not only did gehrke help nullify an effective injunction that had stopped the cove mallard sale for at least a few more months
5463669 but he offended a friendly judge forced roselle and fullum to sacrifice themselves and show the opposition just how weak the national environmental groups really are
5463670 essentially what we need the government to do is get out of the way let the market system work get some certainly into the west side timber supply because we dont know whether to build another plant here to go to canada or even whether we should be hiring folks for a month from now because we cant be assured that our veneer supplier are going to have the raw material were going to need
5463671 the wilderness societys founders aldo leopold and bob marshall believed that progress in environmental protection required radical political and economic changes
5463672 but the new wilderness society through its repeated actions has refused to challenge a system where our public resources are controlled by renegade public agencies and multinational corporations a system that assumes that our natural resources exist solely for the purpose of making money the wilderness societys corporate motto is whatever you do dont offend anyone

5463676 the popularity of religion as a whole may be in a slight decline here in america but that certainly doesnt mean the holy books reputation as being a perennial no 1
5463677 religion is divisive and dangerous its time for us to stand up to it

5463686 and my friends in the crowd would go wild every time i won chips i was celebrating in a way that i think was rubbing the other players at the table the wrong way i think a lot of the other players took offense when i turned to the crowd and smiled at their cheers a couple of the players told me my celebrations were rubbing them the wrong way and i apologized i told them im sorry please dont take offense and i think they accepted that apology i stopped playing to the crowd after that
5463687 i dont know why weve played together a lot but he held this against me i even said on camera more than once that i didnt want to have a beef with anybody i just wanted to get along with everyone he started drinking at dinner break drinking a lot that made him belligerent being the lowest profile player at the table made me the easiest target
5463688 he took the joy of playing this final table from me
5463689 i dont know if ill ever be able to forgive the guy for that this was an incomplete experience i wanted to have fun at the final table i have a bitter taste in my mouth its unfortunate that he did that

5463926 the present invention relates to apparatus and a method for monitoring brain waves wherein all components of the apparatus are remote from the test subject
5463927 high frequency transmitters are operated to radiate electromagnetic energy of different frequencies through antennas which are capable of scanning the entire brain of the test subject or any desired region thereof the signals of different frequencies penetrate the skull of the subject and impinge upon the brain where they mix to form an interference wave modulated by radiation from the brains natural electrical activity the modulated interference wave is transmitted by the brain and received by an antenna at a remote station where it is demodulated and processed to provide a profile of the subjects brain waves in addition to passively monitoring his brain waves the subjects neurological processes may be affected by transmitting to his brain through transmitting compensating signals the latter signals can be derived from the received and processed brain waves
5463928 through generation of stereo audio signals having specific wave shapes human brain waves in the form of eegs are superimposed upon specific stereo audio signals known as carrier frequencies which are within the range of human hearing
5463929 it is possible to field a truck portable microwave barrier system that will completely immobilize personnel in the open with present day technology and equipment
5463930 sounds and possibly even words which appear to be originating intercranially
5463931 radio frequency radiation rfr fields pose powerful and revolutionary anti personnel military threats electromagnetic fields can be disruptive to purposeful behavior and may be capable of directing or interrogating such behavior
5463932 passage of 100 milliamperes through the myocardium of the brain can lead to cardiac standstill and death
5463933 a rapidly scanning rfr system could provide an effective stun or kill capability over a large area
5463934 the revolution in military affairs and conflicts short of war
5463935 that will not only change the nature of warfare but also alter the global geopolitical balance of power
5463936 we will have achieved a clear understanding of how the human brain works how it really controls the various functions of the body and how it can be manipulated both negatively and positively one can envision the development of electromagnetic energy sources the output of which can be pulsed shaped and focused that can couple with the human body in a fashion that will allow one to prevent voluntary muscle movements control emotions and thus actions produce sleep transmit suggestions interfere with both short term and long term memory produce an experience set and delete an experience set
5463937 it would also appear possible to create high fidelity speech in the human body raising the possibility of covert suggestion and psychological direction when a high power microwave pulse in the gigahertz range strikes the human body a very small temperature perturbation occurs this is associated with a sudden expansion of the slightly heated tissue this expansion is fast enough to produce an acoustic wave if a pulsed stream is used it should be possible to create an internal acoustic field in the 5 15 kilohertz range which is audible thus it may be possible to talk to selected adversaries in a fashion that would be most disturbing to them
5463938 the civilian population will likely accept an implanted microscopic microchip that allows military members to defend vital national interests
5463939 the california institute of technology has developed an energy efficient computer chip which emulates the analog thinking of the human brain when this capability is fully mature this chip could provide the baseline for a brain implant hooked to all the sensory segments of the brain not just the eye
5463940 an ethical and political revolution would be necessary to make a military revolution
5463941 there is another alternative we could deliberately engineer a comprehensive revolution seeking utter transformation rather than simply an expeditious use of new technology
5463942 psychotronic research is in its infancy but the us army already possesses an operational weapons system designed to do what lt col j b alexander would like esp to do except that this weapons system uses existing communications media it seeks to map the minds of neutral and enemy individuals and then change them in accordance with us national interests
5463943 for the mind to believe in its own decisions it must feel that it made those decisions without coercion coercive measures used by the operative consequently must not be detectable by ordinary means there is no need to resort to mind weakening drugs such as those explored by the cia in fact the exposure of a single such method would do unacceptable damage to mindwars reputation for truth
5463944 if we do not accept excalibur then we relinquish our ability to inspire foreign cultures with our morality
5463945 after retiring from the army in 1988 alexander joined the los alamos national laboratories and began working with janet morris the research director of the u s global strategy council usgsc chaired by dr ray cline former deputy director of the cia
5463946 born in new york in 1937 he spent part of his career as a commander of green berets special forces in vietnam led cambodian mercenaries behind enemy lines and took part in a number of clandestine programs including phoenix he currently holds the post of director of non lethal programs in the los alamos national laboratories
5463947 in 1971 while a captain in the infantry at schofield barracks honolulu he was diving in the biminis islands looking for the lost continent of atlantis he was an official representative for the silva mind control organization and a lecturer on pre cataclysmic civilizations alexander is also a past president and a board member of the international association for near death studies and with his former wife jan northup he helped dr c b scott jones perform esp experiments with dolphins
5463948 the church of set is a group with hundreds of members that operates on a national level aquino is the official head of the organization and rules through a council of nine who are in fact his lieutenants
5463949 puthoff says his involvement with the church more than a decade ago was casual
5463950 the jonestown experiment was conceived of by dr lawrence laird layton staffed by him and financed by layton
5463951 enhancing the economic and political powers of james warren jones
5463952 to eliminate a few hundred guerillas the government killed perhaps 10 000 guatemalan peasants
5463953 during that period i spent most of my time as a high class muscleman for big business wall street and the bankers thus i helped make mexico and especially tampico safe for american oil interests in 1914 i helped make haiti and cuba a decent place for the national bank boys to collect oil revenues in i helped in the raping of half a dozen central american republics for the benefit of wall street in china i helped to see to it that standard oil went its way unmolested

5463956 it would go to our headquarters and then it would go to washington and nothing would ever happen the intelligence gleaned from these people was more important than stopping the drug traffic

5463966 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
5463967 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
5463968 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
5463969 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
5463970 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
5463971 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
5463972 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
5463973 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
5463974 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
5463975 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
5463976 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
5463977 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
5463978 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word

5463998 in the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an american and assimilates himself to us he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birthplace or origin but this is predicated upon the persons becoming in every facet an american and nothing but an american there can be no divided allegiance here any man who says he is an american but something else also isnt an american at all we have room for but one flag the american flag we have room for but one language here and that is the english language and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the american people
5463999 let us say to the immigrant not that we hope he will learn english but that he has got to

5464012 we demand that there not be any such externally imposed trade liberalisation between sadc and the european union
5464013 we deplore the splitting up of sadc into two groups negotiating epas with eu this is not only weakening them now but it is also placing at risk the future development co operation and integration of the whole of sadc
5464014 we are already facing drawn out and complicated processes of coordinating and accommodating the needs of our people and countries of different sizes and levels of development
5464015 this will be made much more complicated and even contradicted by separate and differing external trade and trade related agreements signed by members of sadc with eu
5464016 it must resolve internal differences within sadc and advance decisively with sadc developmental cooperation and agreements according to sadc peoples aims and interests
5464017 we must stop the neo liberal policies aimed at re colonising africa we must not allow eu development cooperation aid to lure our countries into irreversible commitments that can place the entire future of sadc in jeopardy
5464018 sadc has been torn apart by epas because of the arm twisting tactics of the eu which has left countries receiving aid from europe vulnerable
5464019 we are saying that these epas must be stopped the bilateral agreements that some sadc countries are entering into are a reflection of the sheer complacency of some of our sadc governments

5464120 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5464121 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5464122 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5464123 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order

5464132 in conversations about specific roman catholics or jews it is common to hear them described as either observant or nonobservant in both cases the line between observance and nonobservance is easy to spot because the person either does or does not practice the ceremonies and religious routines that constitute the commonality of faith protestantism however has no such language instead discussions along these lines about protestants usually employ the words genuine nominal authentic or dead since the rise of pietism in the seventeenth century and the anglo american revivals of the following century the goal among god fearing protestants has been to eliminate observant protestantism
5464133 the problem was how do you find the people on the blacklist its not like you had their address and telephone number the normal procedure would be to go into a village and just grab someone and say wheres nguyen so and so half the time the people were so afraid they would say anything then a phoenix team would take the informant put a sandbag over his head poke out two holes so he could see put commo wire around his neck like a long leash and walk him through the village and say when we go by nguyens house scratch your head then that night phoenix would come back knock on the door and say april fool motherfucker whoever answered the door would get wasted as far as they were concerned whoever answered was a communist including family members sometimes theyd come back to camp with ears to prove that they killed people
5464134 i would have done a lot of things differently and been more cautious about getting us involved
5464135 a strategic disaster which cost us 57 000 lives and a half trillion dollars
5464136 until recently anything that smacked of mind control was extremely dangerous
5464137 i would argue we threw the baby out with the bath water
5464138 maybe i can fix you or electronically neuter you so its safe to release you into society so you wont come back and kill me
5464139 where does that fall in the ethics spectrum thats a really tough question
5464140 it is better for all the world if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime or to let them starve for their imbecility society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind the principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the fallopian tubes jacobson v massachusetts 197 u s 11 25 s ct 358 3 ann cas 765 three generations of imbeciles are enough
5464141 germanys war would yield a total solution to the jewish problem
5464142 my assistant dr josef mengele m d ph d joined me in this branch of research he is presently employed as hauptsturmf hrer captain and camp physician in the auschwitz concentration camp anthropological testing of the most diverse racial groups in this concentration camp is being carried out with permission of the ss reichsf hrer himmler
5464143 the toll of eugenics laws would fall heavily on non jewish germans as well
5464144 under some conditions it might be brittle like glass or soft like lead it will disintegrate at room temperature undergoing five phase changes between room temperature and the melting point it is fiendishly toxic even in small amounts
5464145 he would chew the spoon to pieces his tongue too
5464146 starting in 1955 bill had nosebleeds backaches and coughing attacks followed by vomiting nausea and upset stomach his nosebleeds would last for days at a time his teeth rapidly decayed and his feet became dry and scaly in 1971 he was hospitalized for tests that found bone cancer that spread rapidly and six months later he was gone
5464147 say the lie often enough and people will believe it
5464148 she has eyelashes and eyelids and tear ducts but no eyes it makes life difficult its hard to be blind
5464149 i guess the government really won all the culprits that planned and executed this thing got away with it
5464150 for them to say that a little apology is enough is just beyond belief
5464151 i do feel betrayed and i feel abused by this committees report
5464152 at first the people felt sick and had some diarrhea then difficulty breathing followed by low blood pressure some cases had trouble with their optic nerve and went blind pregnant women gave birth to still born or premature children most of the affected cattle died from serious diarrhea and river fish floated on the surface of the water belly up soon after the chemicals were spread
5464153 the herbicides used are non toxic and not dangerous to man or animal life the land is not affected for future use
5464154 it is now clear that we are facing an implacable enemy whose avowed objective is world domination by whatever means and at whatever cost
5464155 the gehlen organization was the one group that did have networks inside eastern europe and that is why we hired them
5464156 hiring gehlen was the biggest mistake the us ever made
5464157 you are putting nazis at the senior levels of your intelligence and they were right
5464158 the soviets were about to attack west germany that was the biggest bunch of baloney then and it is still a bunch of baloney today
5464159 gehlen had to make his money by creating a threat that we were afraid of so we would give him more money to tell us about it
5464160 in my opinion the gehlen organization provided nothing worthwhile for understanding or estimating soviet military or political capabilities in eastern europe or anywhere else
5464161 fed the names of suspect people in his organization to the fbi secretly and regularly enough to be assigned
5464162 pike will pay for this you wait and see any political ambitions that senator pike had in n y are through we will destroy him for this
5464163 should be favorably affected by developing the international image of the cuban government as rash irresponsible and as an alarming and unpredictable threat to the peace of the western hemisphere
5464164 running through all of them is a central theme that the primary if not exclusive danger to this country is internal communist infiltration
5464165 thesis of the nature of the communist threat often is developed by equating social legislation with socialism and the latter with communism much of the administrations kennedy domestic legislative programs including graduated income tax social security federal aid to education etc under this philosophy would be characterized as steps toward communism
5464166 he weeps he mutters and prays aloud in his cell
5464167 the prisoner feels the something must be done to end this
5464168 my super spy plays his role as a communist in the waking state aggressively consistently fearlessly but his pb is a loyal american and pb has all the memories of pa as a loyal american he will not hesitate to divulge these memories
5464169 if you get a hold of a directory for the american psychiatric association in around 1956 or 1957 youll be surprised to find that an enormous percentage of the individuals listed are foreign born mostly they came out of germany and eastern europe in a big wave they were all called technical specialists
5464170 mind control programs for u s intelligence these would go to people like dr cameron in canada
5464171 there would be no secrets of the mind that we cannot probe electrically
5464172 well develop a system that will keep tabs on people without their knowing what were getting from them
5464173 cybernetics can be used in molding of a childs character the inculcation of knowledge and techniques the amassing of experience the establishment of social behavior patterns all functions which can be summarized as control of the growth processes of the individual
5464174 when a part of your brain receives a tiny electrical impulse from outside sources such as vision hearing etc an emotion is produced anger at the sight of a gang of boys beating an old woman for example the same emotions of anger can be created by artificial radio signals sent to your brain by a controller you could instantly feel the same white hot anger without any apparent reason
5464175 science has developed a new electrical methodology for the study and control of cerebral function in animals and humans
5464176 we may transform we may shape direct robotize man i think the great danger of the future is that we will have robotized human beings who are not aware they have been robotized
5464177 ability to perform simultaneous recording and stimulation of brain functions thereby permitting the establishment of feedbacks and on demand programs of excitation with the aid of the computer
5464178 provide information directly to the brain circumventing normal sensory receptors
5464179 communication from the brain to computer and back to the brain
5464180 clinical applications to humans of on demand programs of stimulation triggered by predetermined electrical pattern
5464181 this new knowledge is so important that i think is should radically change the philosophy of our education system which believes in the sanctity of individuals thinking that an individual exists at birth this belief is not true and this science is going to prove the fallacy of democracy in the sense that we talk about the rights of the individual this democratic belief is not true
5464182 looking into the future it may be predicted that telerecording and telestimulation of the brain will be widely used
5464183 theyre employing the psychiatric armamentarium and a new technological tool set what has come to be known as psycho technology under the guise of therapeutic behavior modification theyre applying anything from the terror drug anectine and other aversive drugs to psychosurgery
5464184 i was serving my country in their bold effort to fight communism
5464185 children were used as subjects because they were more fun to work with and cheaper too they needed lower profile subjects than soldiers and government people so only young willing females would do besides
5464186 i like scaring them they in the agency think i am a god creating subjects in experiments for whatever deviant purposes sid and james could think up
5464187 in order to keep more funding coming from different sources for radiation and mind control projects
5464188 it needed to be done faster then to get rid of the subjects or they were asking for us to come back later and haunt them with our remembrances
5464189 having been through a number of names i can say that nothing has had the impact of non lethal
5464190 major political benefit can be accrued by being the first nation to announce a policy advocating projection of force in a manner that does not result in killing people
5464191 non lethal weapons disable or destroy without causing significant injury or damage
5464192 a u s lead in non lethal technologies will increase our options and reinforce our position in the post cold war world
5464193 liquefy their bowels and reduce them to quivering diarrheic messes
5464194 once you are into these anti materiel weapons it is a short jump to antipersonnel weapons
5464195 more than any other issue people just do not want to talk about this
5464196 short term research will be completed to adopt military technology to use by domestic law enforcement including laser microwave and electromagnetic weapons
5464197 the pentagon and the doj have agreed to share state of the art military technology with civilian law enforcement agencies including exotic
5464198 radio frequency weapons high powered microwave technology acoustic technology voice synthesis and application of extreme frequency electromagnetic fields to non lethal weapons
5464199 counter drug law enforcement applied technology for improved operational effectiveness
5464200 transition of advanced military technologies to the civil law enforcement environment
5464201 the church of set is a group with hundreds of members that operates on a national level aquino is the official head of the organization and rules through a council of nine who are in fact his lieutenants
5464202 the jonestown experiment was conceived of by dr lawrence laird layton staffed by him and financed by layton
5464203 enhancing the economic and political powers of james warren jones
5464204 another layer might will be the memory of seeing people hurt or even killed then they remember having seen babies killed another layer is realizing that they participated in the sacrifices one of the most painful memories may be that they even sacrificed their own baby
5464205 i have only seen those coming forth to get help they are in their twenties and thirties for the most part i can only assume that it is expanding geometrically and am horrified the numbers represented by the generation who are now children and teenagers
5464206 that scientific evidence proved 60 of all women molested as children believed the experience was good for them
5464207 unfounded allegations a new child abuse problem and numerous other cover stories to confuse the issue
5464208 the u s government has an electronic device which could implant thoughts in people
5464209 pseudo identity and the treatment of personality changes in victims of captivity and cults
5464210 in his role of the leadership of the negro people
5464211 to eliminate a few hundred guerillas the government killed perhaps 10 000 guatemalan peasants
5464212 during that period i spent most of my time as a high class muscleman for big business wall street and the bankers thus i helped make mexico and especially tampico safe for american oil interests in 1914 i helped make haiti and cuba a decent place for the national bank boys to collect oil revenues in i helped in the raping of half a dozen central american republics for the benefit of wall street in china i helped to see to it that standard oil went its way unmolested
5464213 youd be running a criminal investigation say narcotics youd find out that inspector so and so of your national police is involved in this
5464214 you investigate up to a point and you cant go any further
5464215 it would go to our headquarters and then it would go to washington and nothing would ever happen the intelligence gleaned from these people was more important than stopping the drug traffic
5464216 their mission was to get people to fight against the communists not stop the drug traffic
5464217 curious hybrid of rasputin perry como and mr fix it
5464218 mosaic of bcci connections surrounding harken energy since george w bush came on board
5464219 bcci was the mother and father of terrorist financing operations
5464220 flown across the border in light air craft and sold to child sex rings or sold so their organs could be used in transplants
5464221 i finally wound up living for safety reasons with sarah the dean of the white house press corps who had been with every president since fdr and was in army intelligence and also an attorneys daughter from texas
5464222 american people are at a point where they are ready and willing to hear the truth
5464223 my former husband george who is a trained assassin calls the people he is involved with the members of the firm or the brotherhood if you are in the clique you are above the law and literally can get away with murder for years mostly when he was drinking he told me how he and others in this elite military group would kill people
5464224 there were many other things and people he told me about which were startling things ill tell you later but george is like a robot glazed eyes and all while he drinks he sort of comes alive it is hard to explain unless you actually see him he told me he was the no 1 shooter for a long time for a group of powerful people at the top if a guy is too honest for example they get rid of him
5464225 i just keep myself and my story in the public eye i am a decent honest person who believes in telling the truth i have a deep abiding faith and trust in god i also come from a strong minded strong willed family and i am not afraid of generals and admirals
5464226 as far as the sheer numbers of people involved in this cap and gown skull and bones secret society its hard to say but it is based on old friendships college and prep school relationships covering up secrets and sexual perversion
5464227 my husband told me about all the sexually perverted rituals like anal and oral sex in coffins at drunken parties and running naked in the woods at bohemian grove then there was the last time i saw george which was in 2001 and he was telling me to keep quiet but i think he knows i will never stop telling the truth
5464228 in general they are first generation german sons mostly who run things in the military through tight friendships made in europe and at war colleges
5464229 after what i heard all those years and now putting it into perspective after 9 11 i think they are trying to destroy america their whole game is all about war selling weapons and creating a militaristic society i know firsthand from listening to my husband they will do anything i mean anything including murder to get what they want
5464230 before 9 11 there were some things which let me know that it was involved with war gaming going on at act commands center in suffolk
5464231 i know that there was a war game going on via tampa i think it was called bright star which was being run on 9 11 by a weird and insecure usmc general who was in charge while the army head was conveniently away in the near east
5464232 i am sure 9 11 was a joint and combined military operation using boys who were recruited via a q khans israeli network in pakistan and south africa through zionists in hamburg i believe that certain mi6 british zionists with the ian goodwin peter goodwin basil cardinal hume yorkshire network were also involved in funding and recruiting these guys it was a large and ongoing operation to set up and involved lots of cia zionists and lots of funny money
5464233 he started drinking did a lot of heavy drinking and at first i thought i could change him
5464234 he started talking openly about murder corruption assassinations and lies it was just incredible the names that were involved and the people who were being killed
5464235 he gave me very detailed and graphic descriptions about how waco was carried out as well as how many other hits went down including malcolm kerr the head of the american university in beirut and ron brown who was trying to take away the state departments monopoly on drug money and arms deals
5464236 my husband would get into these crazed stupors where he would be running around the house naked and there were times i would find him lying in the grass that way
5464237 i learned about how he was sexually molested by homosexual teachers at the elite hun school where a lot of the others in this small elite group also attended including the members the saudi royal family
5464238 he mentioned how many of the brotherhood as he liked to call them are members of
5464239 then i started getting death threats had my house burglarized my car messed with and every time i would try to get the fbi or police to act strangely nothing would be done
5464240 i later found out i was flagged by marine general al gray my husbands boss who put the wheels in motion on much of the criminal activity he flagged me as a trouble maker knowing i was a free thinker who was not about to keep quiet like all the other military wives who knew too much finally i sought help from sarah mcclendon who basically saved my life
5464241 i remember one morning getting this call during a commercial break and then we put kay on live for about 45 minutes i couldnt believe what i was hearing
5464242 after the show i arranged for kay to come to michigan with her documentation and photos of the story
5464243 when griggs arrived with her husbands diary and photos providing credible documentation for some of what she claimed strawcutter taped her story for over eight hours
5464244 people need to know the truth about 9 11 waco the oklahoma city bombing and of course what kay griggs is saying
5464245 i basically believed she was telling the truth and decided to go with the story as she told it
5464246 no not really i never worry about things like that but i do know after winning a landmark federal case to stay on the air in the 1990s the feds came down real hard on me about three months after 9 11 with another legal challenge to my station which had become wildly successful becoming the second top rated show in the county
5464247 with all thats happening in the world the time is right now for truth
5464248 i think america can handle the truth now and i basically want people to know that my husband and the people involved with him are really nothing but cowards and bullies but they are at the same time dangerous evil people that must be stopped i am not a vindictive person and i also am not seeking publicity i simply want people to know the truth about how these people are trying to destroy this country
5464249 im in the midst of research on the headmistress of my episcopal girls school st margarets who spent years working with mi6 at cheltenham this is victor rothschilds group with 6 representing the six sided star and mi5 being more masonic but still not sure about all of this yet
5464250 the total submission of ones will to some outside force
5464251 world opinion is not ready for dealing appropriately with the problems coming from the possibility of direct access to the human mind
5464252 the us air force identified five different frequencies in this compound harmonic the russians were sending through the earth and the atmosphere the intention was to affect a change in consciousness in mankind the elf waves will penetrate anything and everything the specially shielded faraday cage the ocean nothing stops or weakens these signals
5464253 7 83 hertz could make a person feel good this was the schumann resonance the earths pulse rate
5464254 whole populations can be controlled by elf waves intensive research on such behavior modification is now being conducted by the us govt to find out just what such waves do to people
5464255 this electromagnetic research is similar to the secret drug experiments conducted on the unsuspecting populace in the 1950s
5464256 these waves cannot be jammed the lower frequency hertz waves are as long as 300 000 miles the government has built huge transmitters in south africa australia and other places to beam elf waves back to russia there is no shield that will stop these signals
5464257 a method for remote control of electrical stimulation of the nervous system
5464258 at a distance mental suggestion to go to sleep was complied with within a minute
5464259 the human auditory system and a table radio may be one order of magnitude apart in sensitivity to rf energy
5464260 stimulating the nervous system without the damage caused by electrodes
5464261 rajewsky and i had published a paper on the conductivity of erythrocytes reporting for the first time dielectric measurements on biological materials extending up to 1 000 mhz i mention all of these things to indicate the decisive role that the navy and nih played navy support has been available to me in one form or another ever since 1947 and nih support since 1952
5464262 while a young physics student financial problems forced me to interrupt my studies until i found employment as an electronics technician at the oswalt institute for physics in medicine now the max planck institute for biophysics cell membranes are not likely to be affected directly by microwaves since fields of interest can only apply potentials across the membranes that are vanishingly small in comparison with potentials needed to yield significant membrane responses and significant responses of biopolymers require field strength levels very much higher than those causing undue heating
5464263 i am not aware of military antipersonnel weapons using electromagnetic em radiation
5464264 the spoken word of the hypnotist may be conveyed by modulated electromagnetic energy directly into the subconscious parts of the human brain i
5464265 the second experiment was the implanting of hypnotic suggestions for simple acts like leaving the lab to buy some particular item which were to be triggered by a suggested time spoken word or sight subjects were to be interviewed later it may be expected that they rationalize their behavior and consider it to be undertaken out of their own free will
5464266 we could put animals into a stupor by hitting them with these frequencies we got chick brains in vitro to dump 80 of the natural opioids in their brains the effect was non lethal and reversible you could disable a person temporarily it would have been like a stun gun we would have had a weapon in one year
5464267 he blurted out im at a pay phone i cant talk long they are watching me i cant go to the meeting or ever communicate with you again im sorry youve been a good friend goodbye
5464268 im sorry there is no one here by that name
5464269 the capability of communicating directly with humans by pulsed microwaves is obviously not limited to the field of therapeutic medicine
5464270 i certainly could educate a child by putting an electrode in the lateral hypothalamus and then selecting the situations at which i stimulate it in this way i can grossly change his behavior
5464271 did research on the effects of electromagnetic radiation on the brain for a pentagon weapons project
5464272 human experience of god can be generated by a process that has nothing to do with whether god exists or not
5464273 on the possibility of directly accessing every human brain by electromagnetic induction of fundamental algorithms
5464274 a process which is coupled to the narrow band of brain temperature could allow all normal human brains to be affected by a sub harmonic whose frequency range at 10 hz would only vary by 0 1 hz
5464275 random variations of noise within the matrices could potentially differentiate between individual brains
5464276 identification of these sequences could also allow direct access to the most complex neurocognitive processes associated with the self human consciousness and the aggregate of experimental representations episodic memory that define the individual within the brain
5464277 circumvented by direct induction of this information within the brain the basic premise is that synthetic duplication of the neuroelectrical correlates generated by sensors to an actual stimulus should produce identical experiences without the presence of that stimulus
5464278 the power levels for these amplitudes are similar to those associated with the signals generated globally by radio and communication systems within the last two decades a potential has emerged which was improbable but which is now marginally feasible this potential is the technical capability to influence directly the major portion of the approximately six billion brains of the human species by generating neural information within a physical medium within which all members of the species are immersed
5464279 we would lose hundreds of millions of dollars in congress if we did not perform it successfully we put a beacon with a certain frequency on the target vehicle on the interceptor we had a receiver the hit looked beautiful so congress did not ask questions
5464280 the very idea of star wars an umbrella that would shield america from soviet nuclear warheads was itself a massive deception no knowledgeable scientist thought for a minute such a shield was feasible yet the pentagon proceeded with this fraud and faked other tests in 1990 and 1991 after the soviet threat had disappeared
5464281 all the talk about death rays and charged particle beams has been little more than an elaborate smokescreen designed to hide the fact that the us is developing a directed energy weapon that uses a high power microwave pulse
5464282 should we be invaded by aliens it would be used to defend the earth
5464283 a method and apparatus for altering a region of the earths atmosphere ionosphere and magnetosphere
5464284 cause total disruption of all forms of communications over a very large portions of the earth missile or aircraft destruction deflection or confusion weather modification by altering solar absorption
5464285 earths axial spin means that a burst lasting more than a few minutes will slice through the ionosphere like microwave knife producing not a
5464286 the ionosphere is prone to catalytic reactions so if a small part is changed a major change in the ionosphere can happen
5464287 the instabilities commonly studied are approaching their maximum rf energy dissipative capacity beyond which the plasma process will
5464288 the surge of power became an avalanche at the pole in the vertical plane of the earths magnetic field where the winds of magnetism would not rise to blow it out
5464289 earths an electrical motor when the motor began to run wild it would increase its rotational speed eventually the earth would explode from increased centrifugal stress
5464290 frequencies of 10 to 20 hertz pulses per second or maybe one hertz one cycle per second type waves
5464291 part of the central nervous systems for the nations intelligence community
5464292 apparatus and method for remotely monitoring and altering brain waves
5464293 apparatus for method of sensing brain waves at a position remote from the subject whereby electromagnetic signals of different frequencies are simultaneously transmitted to the brain of the subject
5464294 the present invention relates to apparatus and a method for monitoring brain waves wherein all components of the apparatus are remote from the test subject
5464295 high frequency transmitters are operated to radiate electromagnetic energy of different frequencies through antennas which are capable of scanning the entire brain of the test subject or any desired region thereof the signals of different frequencies penetrate the skull of the subject and impinge upon the brain where they mix to form an interference wave modulated by radiation from the brains natural electrical activity the modulated interference wave is transmitted by the brain and received by an antenna at a remote station where it is demodulated and processed to provide a profile of the subjects brain waves in addition to passively monitoring his brain waves the subjects neurological processes may be affected by transmitting to his brain through transmitting compensating signals the latter signals can be derived from the received and processed brain waves
5464296 through generation of stereo audio signals having specific wave shapes human brain waves in the form of eegs are superimposed upon specific stereo audio signals known as carrier frequencies which are within the range of human hearing
5464297 the technique of telemetric control of human beings offers the possibility of regulating behavior with precision on a subconscious level
5464298 surround the criminal with a kind of externalized conscience an electronic substitute for social conditioning group pressure and inner motivation
5464299 the poor and uneducated urban dweller who is fundamentally unnecessary to the economy
5464300 the use of electronics in the observation and control of human behavior and its possible use in rehabilitation and control
5464301 in the very near future a computer technology will make possible alternatives to imprisonment the development of systems for telemetering information from sensors implanted in or on the body will soon make possible the observation and control of human behavior without actual physical contact it will be possible to maintain 24 hour surveillance over the subject and to intervene electronically or physically to influence and control selected behavior it will thus be possible to exercise control over human behavior and from a distance without contact
5464302 psychotronic research is in its infancy but the us army already possesses an operational weapons system designed to do what lt col j b alexander would like esp to do except that this weapons system uses existing communications media it seeks to map the minds of neutral and enemy individuals and then change them in accordance with us national interests
5464303 it must strengthen our national will to victory and it must attack and ultimately destroy that of our enemy it both causes and is affected by physical combat but it is a type of war which is fought on a far more subtle basis as well in the minds of the national populations involved
5464304 if we do not attack the enemys will until he reaches the battlefield his nation will have strengthened it as best it can we must attack that will before it is locked into place we must instill in it a predisposition to inevitable defeat
5464305 strategic mindwar must begin the moment war is considered to be inevitable
5464306 for the mind to believe in its own decisions it must feel that it made those decisions without coercion coercive measures used by the operative consequently must not be detectable by ordinary means there is no need to resort to mind weakening drugs such as those explored by the cia in fact the exposure of a single such method would do unacceptable damage to mindwars reputation for truth
5464307 existing psyop identifies purely sociological factors which suggest appropriate idioms for messages doctrine in this area is highly developed and the task is basically one of assembling and maintaining individuals and teams with enough expertise and experience to apply the doctrine effectively this however is only the sociological dimension of target receptiveness measures there are some purely natural conditions under which minds may become more or less receptive to ideas and mindwar should take full advantage of such phenomena as atmospheric electromagnetic activity air ionization and extremely low frequency waves 21
5464308 if we do not accept excalibur then we relinquish our ability to inspire foreign cultures with our morality if they then desire moralities unsatisfactory to us we have no choice but to fight them on a more brutish level
5464309 after retiring from the army in 1988 alexander joined the los alamos national laboratories and began working with janet morris the research director of the u s global strategy council usgsc chaired by dr ray cline former deputy director of the cia
5464310 born in new york in 1937 he spent part of his career as a commander of green berets special forces in vietnam led cambodian mercenaries behind enemy lines and took part in a number of clandestine programs including phoenix he currently holds the post of director of non lethal programs in the los alamos national laboratories
5464311 in 1971 while a captain in the infantry at schofield barracks honolulu he was diving in the biminis islands looking for the lost continent of atlantis he was an official representative for the silva mind control organization and a lecturer on pre cataclysmic civilizations alexander is also a past president and a board member of the international association for near death studies and with his former wife jan northup he helped dr c b scott jones perform esp experiments with dolphins
5464312 he served in naval intelligence for approximately 15 years including assignments with carrier division 14 and as assistant naval attach new delhi india and kathmandu nepal in the 1960s he collected intelligence and provided intelligence support throughout southeast asia the middle east and north africa
5464313 jones has briefed the presidents scientific advisory committee and has testified before house and senate committees on intelligence matters

5464322 perhaps the most disturbing wanderer into this mind field is joseph a
5464323 in may 1982 elisabeth targ and i r t were invited to hold a workshop at esalen institute for a group of twenty five professional men and women
5464324 cover stories may be established for unacknowledged programs in order to protect the integrity of that program from individuals who do not have a need to know cover stories must be believable and cannot reveal any information regarding the true nature of the contract cover stories for saps must have the approval of the pso program security officer prior to the dissemination
5464325 in the darkest days of the cold war the military lied to the american public about the true nature of many unidentified flying objects in an effort to hide its growing fleet of spy planes the deceptions were made in the 1950s and 60s amid a wave of ufo sightings that alarmed the public and parts of official washington
5464326 the revolution in military affairs and conflicts short of war
5464327 that will not only change the nature of warfare but also alter the global geopolitical balance of power
5464328 we will have achieved a clear understanding of how the human brain works how it really controls the various functions of the body and how it can be manipulated both negatively and positively one can envision the development of electromagnetic energy sources the output of which can be pulsed shaped and focused that can couple with the human body in a fashion that will allow one to prevent voluntary muscle movements control emotions and thus actions produce sleep transmit suggestions interfere with both short term and long term memory produce an experience set and delete an experience set
5464329 it would also appear possible to create high fidelity speech in the human body raising the possibility of covert suggestion and psychological direction when a high power microwave pulse in the gigahertz range strikes the human body a very small temperature perturbation occurs this is associated with a sudden expansion of the slightly heated tissue this expansion is fast enough to produce an acoustic wave if a pulsed stream is used it should be possible to create an internal acoustic field in the 5 15 kilohertz range which is audible thus it may be possible to talk to selected adversaries in a fashion that would be most disturbing to them
5464330 the civilian population will likely accept an implanted microscopic microchip that allows military members to defend vital national interests
5464331 the california institute of technology has developed an energy efficient computer chip which emulates the analog thinking of the human brain when this capability is fully mature this chip could provide the baseline for a brain implant hooked to all the sensory segments of the brain not just the eye
5464332 an ethical and political revolution would be necessary to make a military revolution
5464333 there is another alternative we could deliberately engineer a comprehensive revolution seeking utter transformation rather than simply an expeditious use of new technology
5464334 to exploit less than lethal biological effects of electromagnetic radiation for air force security peacekeeping and war fighting operations
5464335 thermal gun that would have the operational effect of heating the body to 105 to 107 degrees fahrenheit
5464336 this is an effect that literally gets under your skin
5464337 i can assure you once you come in contact with the beam you will be inclined to stop whatever you are doing
5464338 it is possible to field a truck portable microwave barrier system that will completely immobilize personnel in the open with present day technology and equipment
5464339 sounds and possibly even words which appear to be originating intercranially
5464340 radio frequency radiation rfr fields pose powerful and revolutionary anti personnel military threats electromagnetic fields can be disruptive to purposeful behavior and may be capable of directing or interrogating such behavior
5464341 passage of 100 milliamperes through the myocardium of the brain can lead to cardiac standstill and death
5464342 a rapidly scanning rfr system could provide an effective stun or kill capability over a large area
5464343 crowd control devices using rfr do exist complementing sonic and infra red weapons which are well known and were advertised in the british defense equipment catalogue until 1983
5464344 research in this field has been carried out in almost all industrialized countries with a view to using these phenomenon for anti material or anti personnel purposes it is possible to generate a very powerful microwave pulse between 150 and 3 000 megahertz with an energy level of several hundreds of megawatts using specially adapted antenna systems these generators in principle could transmit over hundreds of meters sufficient energy to cook a meal lethal effects can be expected from this system at much lower energy levels using the principle of magnetic field compensation which permits the control of the geometry of the target by means of antennas specially designed for that purpose the radiation can be concentrated on very small surfaces of the human body for example the base of the brain where relatively low energy can produce lethal effects
5464345 the new high tech type of subliminal messages referred to as ultra high frequency
5464346 although completely silent to the human ear the negative voice messages placed on the tapes alongside the audible programming by psyops psychologists were clearly perceived by the subconscious minds of the iraqi soldiers and the silent messages completely demoralized them and instilled a perpetual feeling of fear and hopelessness in their minds
5464347 high power electromagnetic generators that interfere with human brain waves
5464348 these electronic skull zappers are designed to invade the mind and short circuit its synapses in the hands of government technicians it may be used to disorient entire crowds or to manipulate individuals into self destructive acts its a terrifying weapon
5464349 disable or destroy weapons or weapon development production processes including suspected weapons of mass destruction
5464350 nonconsensual brainwave and personality studies by the u s government
5464351 the 1950s secret discovery of the code of the brain
5464352 heart attacks suicides assassinations blackmail all can be done remotely leaving no trace of evidence to tie it to the perpetrators
5464353 the day has come when we can combine sensory deprivation with the use of drugs hypnosis and the astute manipulation of reward and punishment to gain almost absolute control over an individuals behavior we want to reshape our society drastically
5464354 the passage of approximately 100 milliamperes through the myocardium leads to cardiac standstill and death
5464355 experience with electroshock therapy rfr radiofrequency radiation experiments and the increasing understanding of the brain as an electrically mediated organ suggest the serious probability that impressed electromagnetic fields can be disruptive of purposeful behavior and may be capable of directing and or interrogating such behavior further the passage of approximately 100 milliamperes through the myocardium can lead to cardiac standstill and death again pointing to a speed of light weapons effect
5464356 while initial attention should be toward degradation of human performance through thermal loading and electromagnetic field effects subsequent work should address the possibilities of directing and interrogating mental functioning using externally applied fields within the possibility of a revolutionary capability to defend against hostile actions and to collect intelligence data prior to conflict onset
5464357 the term adversary is used above in its broadest sense including those who are not declared enemies but who are engaged in activities we wish to stop this policy does not preclude legally authorized domestic use of the nonlethal weapons by united states military forces in support of law enforcement
5464358 engaged in psychological training or other types of training of personnel as assassins
5464359 recurring hypnotic state re induced automatically by the same radio command
5464360 pulsating electromagnetic signals can be sent to the brain causing the desired voice and visual effects to be experienced by the target this is a form of electronic warfare
5464361 connecting our brain functions via microchips or even without them according to the latest technology to computers via satellites poses the gravest threat to humanity
5464362 a u s lead in non lethal technologies will increase our options and reinforce our position in the post cold war world our research and development efforts must be increased
5464363 we here in washington are anxious to have you undertake some of these things perhaps on your own undertake a little experiment on what you can do with the muslims what you can do with sociopathic individuals
5464364 an electronic torture chamber using a white noise generator designed to pulse sound at 11 hz apparently ultimately capable of destroying the human body has been installed by a british company electronic intelligence inside the headquarters of the special branch of dubai
5464365 the proprietaries tend to take on a life of their own and several have grown too big and too independent to be either controlled from or dissolved by headquarters
5464366 us intelligence agencies including the nsa would identify prospective ehms who could then be hired by international corporations these ehms would never be paid by the government instead they would draw their salaries from the private sector as a result their dirty work if exposed would be chalked up to corporate greed rather than to government policy in addition the corporations that hired them although paid by the government agencies and their multinational banking counterparts with taxpayer money would be insulated from congressional oversight and public scrutiny shielded by a growing body of legal initiatives including trademark international trade and freedom of information laws
5464367 the commission found no indication the intelligence community distorted the evidence regarding iraqs weapons of mass destruction
5464368 a worldwide propaganda campaign deploying teams of information warriors to allied nations to assist them in developing and delivering specific messages to the local population combatants front line states the media and the international community
5464369 the administration should reject any attempt to re regulate wholesale power markets by adopting price caps
5464370 organizations working to transform the nations social views and giving practices of the nations religious and philanthropic leaders
5464371 to tap all international and some domestic communications circuits and sift out messages which sound interesting
5464372 every international telephone call fax e mail or radio transmission can be listened to by powerful computers capable of voice recognition they home in on a long list of key words or patterns of messages they are looking for evidence of international crime like terrorism
5464373 tools for collaborative reasoning estimating plausible futures and creating actionable options for the decision maker
5464374 at least seven countries are dissecting suspicious trades that may have netted more than 100 million in profits
5464375 the trades involved at least 450 000 shares of american airlines but what raised the red flag is more than 80 of the orders were
5464376 our main mission was to do as much damage as possible to the soviets there was a fallout in terms of drugs yes but the main objective was accomplished the soviets left afghanistan
5464377 did i know that he was out there yes i did guys like bin laden were bringing 20 25 million a month from other saudis and gulf arabs to underwrite the war and that is a lot of money its an extra 200 300 million a year and this is what bin laden did
5464378 the americans were keen to teach the afghans the techniques of urban terrorism car bombing and so on so that they could strike at the russians in major towns many of them are now using their knowledge and expertise to wage war on everything they hate
5464379 it was worth it those were very important pivotal matters that played an important role in the downfall of the soviet union
5464380 what was more important in the world view of history the taliban or the fall of the soviet empire a few stirred up muslims or the liberation of central europe and the end of the cold war
5464381 we were asking the court to enforce a presidential memorandum which bans involuntary research on human subjects
5464382 given the past history of secret experimentation by the government
5464383 these allegations of continuing government sponsored human testing should not be dismissed without more thorough impartial investigation
5464384 information from unintentionally emanated electromagnetic waves in the environment not including radioactivity or nuclear detonation
5464385 the plain dealer uncovered much evidence to suggest that the federal government continues to sponsor research where informed consent is not obtained and this fact disturbed me greatly also on august 15 1994 the new york times reported on ethical and legal questions regarding a companys efforts to promote a drug that can make some children grow taller than they otherwise would the drug in question protropin has been approved by fda for use in children whose bodies do not make sufficient quantities of human growth hormone however once approved doctors may prescribe it for other purposes at their discretion in this case the company was apparently surveying schools for short children and then trying to funnel those children to doctors who would prescribe the drug whether or not the children lacked the human growth hormone this unapproved research was occurring without the oversight of an irb and at least 15 000 children have taken this drug
5464386 specifically the advisory committee recommended that informed consent of all human subjects of classified research be required and that such requirement not be subject to waiver or exemption under current rule and executive order it is possible to waive informed consent and irb review for classified research title ii of this legislation would prohibit the waiver of either informed consent or irb review for classified research i do not claim to have the magic bullet solution with this bill however i believe there are some key principles which should guide the senates consideration of this legislation these principles are first informed consent and independent review of experiments involving human subjects must be required second anyone who violates the right of research subject to have informed consent should be held criminally responsible for that violation i want to put this in personal terms once again you can imagine your spouse husband wife father mother children being experimented on without your knowledge or their knowledge that is unconscionable and we should not permit that this legislation will close many of the loopholes that permit that to happen now
5464387 awake from sleep at night and without reason violently beat his wife and children later being unable to recall the entire incident
5464388 in experiments designed to test the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide lsd the government of the united states treated thousands of its citizens as though they were laboratory animals dosing them with this dangerous drug without their consent

5464399 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5464400 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5464401 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle

5464405 the assembly is backing a practical solution to the property tax crisis
5464406 their bill will deliver real property tax relief for millions of homeowners without threatening our schools paid for responsibly by asking the very wealthiest new yorkers to contribute a bit more in hard economic times the assembly is giving the middle class homeowner a real break and asking the 20 000 a week crowd to help pick up the slack its smart its fair and it will help lots of people
5464407 the senate majority adopted an over simplified gimmick that is proven to be failed public policy in massachusetts california and other states

5464434 excuses to start wars with your own aggression on a very peaceful nation as for russia as poland and located a treasoner to assist you with in and tha all of a sudden yo ustated to russia you can visit and inspect it on poland grolounds you stupid asshole i would not want it there and he stated as for putin i do not need those secrets in russia guess why
5464435 shall i place my state national secrets of u s a dod and cia and fbi and doj and etc on your poland grounds aka in 2009 january eu grounds do you not think it is the same and than what do yoyu think i will support your aggression as u s on russia and my iran who have not ever posed danger your verbal statements were as is first as an aggression than you are placing such tech toys of secrets on a foreign ground soil
5464436 why i have to even explain myself to idiots as to you poland fn war criminal dc
5464437 now you are giving my secrets away and i stated it as lika not russia or u s
5464438 if russia threatens poland then we poles have the right to feel threatened
5464439 but this type of statement from russian generals is a problem for all of nato and i expect the alliance to take a stand on this
5464440 the money screamed across the wires its provenance fading in a maze of electronic transfers which shifted it hid it broke it up into manageable wads which would be withdrawn and redeposited elsewhere obliterating the trail

5464468 our debate on the budget has become very partisan and having our debate i think is very important for the people of the state of california the republican speakers have mentioned on several occasions that the democrats are interested in raising taxes
5464469 if the spending cap was in place today would the rules and the procedures offered in this constitutional amendment from the republicans allow for us to address the housing crisis
5464470 as the court of appeals has affirmed the law requires the bush administration to set fuel economy standards at the maximum feasible level in order to conserve oil reduce greenhouse gas pollution and protect consumers from increasing energy prices
5464471 yet the administrations current proposal still allows oil use and greenhouse gas emissions to spiral upwards while protecting nothing but the profits of the oil and auto industries
5464472 according to the bush administration we should strive to achieve lower fuel economy in 2015 than cars on the road achieve today
5464473 we can and must do better and we will hold this administration accountable for complying with the law and requiring automakers to provide state of the art fuel efficient vehicles
5464474 the administrations unreasonably low vehicle mileage standards block common sense measures to reduce greenhouse gas pollution from cars and trucks
5464475 if the administration approves another set of inadequate fuel standards we will once again challenge them in court

5464485 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5464486 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5464487 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5464488 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5464489 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5464490 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5464491 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5464492 and even though teachers and educators have noble intentions their position in our economy by design is dependent upon a psychology of the scarcity of knowledge

5464496 the children on the other end of the computer screen
5464497 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response
5464498 the critical choice to join the fight against al qaeda the taliban and other extremist groups
5464499 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan
5464500 partly because the u s stayed in visible support of musharraf even after it became clear that the voters had rejected him
5464501 shut up and do absolutely nothing but respond to initiatives from the new government
5464502 the central terrorist threat to the united states lies in northwest pakistan and afghanistan and not iraq
5464503 the real weakness of his as i see it is that he has never realized the importance of institutions
5464504 he just leaves all the institutions of pakistan so weak including the political ones who are to now run the affairs of the country
5464505 onward his standing was on shaky grounds and the power began to slip away from him
5464506 musharraf was a hotheaded and impulsive political leader from day 1 to the end
5464507 this was very unfortunate that he always put his personal ambitions ahead of the interests of the people of pakistan
5464508 for the last years he has been ruling the country and hes been no good to it
5464509 so i think it is better that he has resigned and its over now

5464531 i think its time to move on i made my decision in 2003 when the government asked me to renew my contract i decided that i will not renew my contract when it lapses in 2008
5464532 i think my departure is good for the bank and stakeholders because it would create an air of change in their minds under a new leadership and changes would be seen then
5464533 by the end of the day if the weather cooperates we can probably get all of our tourists out of there
5464534 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5464535 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5464536 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side

5464548 investors have been trying to put the housing and credit crisis behind them
5464549 but every time news like this comes up they have to readjust their thinking
5464550 the oil price is very important and is indeed part of the reason why weve seen investor sentiment look a bit stronger over the course of the last few weeks
5464551 short term it is still a pretty negative picture of slowing economic growth which continues to be a factor
5464552 you have stocks selling off and concerns continuing about the health of financial companies and this stokes the flight to quality bid for treasuries
5464553 with the price of gas right now holding our meeting in the populous southeastern area of the state seems like a good common sense move
5464554 if this proves useful and we have good participation well look at going to other areas of the state in the future

5464560 ive worked with and continue to work with a lot of amazing directors and when im not physically on camera i have watched and learned from them its a major undertaking directing your own movie so i made this first one simple with minimal dialogue and some hot scenes this is my baby and im very proud of it i had a lot of guidance from editor anthony duran and videographer paul snell they along with the great cast really made it what it is i hope everyone enjoys watching it as much as we enjoyed making it

5464582 that night we high tailed it out of there to the hotel
5464583 we re the first point of contact when they get here
5464584 from our time doing training here we ve got such a rapport with these guys they re able to make things happen for us
5464585 this is the best part of the job being able to help people
5464586 i think it was important that we stayed here it sent a message that we don t just pull out
5464587 i ve been able to see some of them who ve come back there were lots of hugs and man kisses
5464588 i can only say that we will not be leaving as fast as we came
5464589 we need to make trade logistics and border infrastructure a priority in the short term or lose opportunities to other global competitors who are better organized to facilitate trade
5464590 on oil alone canada has been the largest supplier to the u s since 1999 not saudi arabia not kuwait nor any other producer from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries
5464591 canada is a stable supplier of energy to the u s whether it is gas and oil in the west or integrated electricity grids in the east
5464592 and being close means lower delivery costs than most other power suppliers
5464593 some of these things become self fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile
5464594 were certainly poised and ready when market conditions are appropriate

5464607 what is the value of eight golds in beijing before a prime time audience in the u s
5464608 id say 100 million over the course of his lifetime
5464609 one gold medal is amazing two is well incredible three practically unbelievable but eight eight gold medals thats thats well well were going to need some new adjectives for whatever that is congratulations michael
5464610 we continue to evaluate post beijing activities that will allow us to reinforce our relationship with michael
5464611 its huge its the opportunity that no startup generally gets
5464612 with opportunity obviously theres a lot of responsibility for us to take advantage of it properly and do it in a way that not only benefits the company but also benefits michael
5464613 we are currently evaluating opportunities to build upon this excitement however a final determination about our future plans has not yet been made
5464614 well at least were near camp if we capsize these boats are beasts to right the girls are laughing i know i should be doing something

5464618 i was serving my country in their bold effort to fight communism
5464619 children were used as subjects because they were more fun to work with and cheaper too they needed lower profile subjects than soldiers and government people so only young willing females would do besides
5464620 i like scaring them they in the agency think i am a god creating subjects in experiments for whatever deviant purposes sid and james could think up
5464621 in order to keep more funding coming from different sources for radiation and mind control projects
5464622 it needed to be done faster then to get rid of the subjects or they were asking for us to come back later and haunt them with our remembrances

5464626 another layer might well be the memory of seeing people hurt or even killed then they remember having seen babies killed another layer is realizing that they participated in the sacrifices one of the most painful memories may be that they even sacrificed their own baby
5464627 i have only seen those coming forth to get help they are in their twenties and thirties for the most part i can only assume that it is expanding geometrically and i am horrified the numbers represented by the generation who are now children and teenagers
5464628 that scientific evidence proved 60 of all women molested as children believed the experience was good for them

5464630 the problem was how do you find the people on the blacklist its not like you had their address and telephone number
5464631 i would have done a lot of things differently and been more cautious about getting us involved
5464632 a strategic disaster which cost us 57 000 lives and a half trillion dollars
5464633 the military and intelligence agencies were still scared by the excesses of mk ultra the infamous cia program that involved in part slipping lsd to unsuspecting victims
5464634 until recently anything that smacked of mind control was extremely dangerous
5464635 i would argue we threw the baby out with the bath water
5464636 maybe i can fix you or electronically neuter you so its safe to release you into society so you wont come back and kill me
5464637 where does that fall in the ethics spectrum thats a really tough question

5464640 at the same time he studied meditation in buddhist monasteries and later engaged in technical exploration and demonstration of advanced human performance
5464641 after retiring from the army in 1988 alexander joined the los alamos national laboratories and began working with janet morris the research director of the u s global strategy council usgsc chaired by dr ray cline former deputy director of the cia
5464642 born in new york in 1937 he spent part of his career as a commander of green berets special forces in vietnam led cambodian mercenaries behind enemy lines and took part in a number of clandestine programs including phoenix he currently holds the post of director of non lethal programs in the los alamos national laboratories

5464645 world opinion is not ready for dealing appropriately with the problems coming from the possibility of direct access to the human mind
5464646 kill an unshielded human being at a distance from five to ten miles
5464647 the human auditory system and a table radio may be one order of magnitude apart in sensitivity to rf energy
5464648 stimulating the nervous system without the damage caused by electrodes
5464649 did research on the effects of electromagnetic radiation on the brain for a pentagon weapons project
5464650 human experience of god can be generated by a process that has nothing to do with whether god exists or not
5464651 on the possibility of directly accessing every human brain by electromagnetic induction of fundamental algorithms
5464652 a process which is coupled to the narrow band of brain temperature could allow all normal human brains to be affected by a sub harmonic whose frequency range at 10 hz would only vary by 0 1 hz
5464653 random variations of noise within the matrices could potentially differentiate between individual brains
5464654 identification of these sequences could also allow direct access to the most complex neurocognitive processes associated with the self human consciousness and the aggregate of experimental representations episodic memory that define the individual within the brain
5464655 circumvented by direct induction of this information within the brain the basic premise is that synthetic duplication of the neuroelectrical correlates generated by sensors to an actual stimulus should produce identical experiences without the presence of that stimulus
5464656 the power levels for these amplitudes are similar to those associated with the signals generated globally by radio and communication systems within the last two decades a potential has emerged which was improbable but which is now marginally feasible this potential is the technical capability to influence directly the major portion of the approximately six billion brains of the human species by generating neural information within a physical medium within which all members of the species are immersed
5464657 psychotronic research is in its infancy but the us army already possesses an operational weapons system designed to do what lt col j b alexander would like esp to do except that this weapons system uses existing communications media it seeks to map the minds of neutral and enemy individuals and then change them in accordance with us national interests
5464658 it must strengthen our national will to victory and it must attack and ultimately destroy that of our enemy it both causes and is affected by physical combat but it is a type of war which is fought on a far more subtle basis as well in the minds of the national populations involved
5464659 if we do not attack the enemys will until he reaches the battlefield his nation will have strengthened it as best it can we must attack that will before it is locked into place we must instill in it a predisposition to inevitable defeat
5464660 strategic mindwar must begin the moment war is considered to be inevitable
5464661 for the mind to believe in its own decisions it must feel that it made those decisions without coercion coercive measures used by the operative consequently must not be detectable by ordinary means there is no need to resort to mind weakening drugs such as those explored by the cia in fact the exposure of a single such method would do unacceptable damage to mindwars reputation for truth
5464662 existing psyop identifies purely sociological factors which suggest appropriate idioms for messages doctrine in this area is highly developed and the task is basically one of assembling and maintaining individuals and teams with enough expertise and experience to apply the doctrine effectively this however is only the sociological dimension of target receptiveness measures there are some purely natural conditions under which minds may become more or less receptive to ideas and mindwar should take full advantage of such phenomena as atmospheric electromagnetic activity air ionization and extremely low frequency waves 21
5464663 if we do not accept excalibur then we relinquish our ability to inspire foreign cultures with our morality if they then desire moralities unsatisfactory to us we have no choice but to fight them on a more brutish level
5464664 the revolution in military affairs and conflicts short of war
5464665 that will not only change the nature of warfare but also alter the global geopolitical balance of power
5464666 we will have achieved a clear understanding of how the human brain works how it really controls the various functions of the body and how it can be manipulated both negatively and positively one can envision the development of electromagnetic energy sources the output of which can be pulsed shaped and focused that can couple with the human body in a fashion that will allow one to prevent voluntary muscle movements control emotions and thus actions produce sleep transmit suggestions interfere with both short term and long term memory produce an experience set and delete an experience set
5464667 it would also appear possible to create high fidelity speech in the human body raising the possibility of covert suggestion and psychological direction when a high power microwave pulse in the gigahertz range strikes the human body a very small temperature perturbation occurs this is associated with a sudden expansion of the slightly heated tissue this expansion is fast enough to produce an acoustic wave if a pulsed stream is used it should be possible to create an internal acoustic field in the 5 15 kilohertz range which is audible thus it may be possible to talk to selected adversaries in a fashion that would be most disturbing to them
5464668 the civilian population will likely accept an implanted microscopic microchip that allows military members to defend vital national interests
5464669 the california institute of technology has developed an energy efficient computer chip which emulates the analog thinking of the human brain when this capability is fully mature this chip could provide the baseline for a brain implant hooked to all the sensory segments of the brain not just the eye
5464670 an ethical and political revolution would be necessary to make a military revolution
5464671 there is another alternative we could deliberately engineer a comprehensive revolution seeking utter transformation rather than simply an expeditious use of new technology
5464672 i was complaining aloud to myself in my home that i couldnt find any d cell batteries i left to run errands the next day and when i came home my home had been entered again and i discovered that the kitchen drawer had 24 d cell batteries
5464673 i cant call up the police and tell them that someone broke into my home and deposited 24 d cell batteries
5464674 do whatever it takes to get me what i need
5464675 when they came for me there was no one left to protest
5464676 the plain dealer uncovered much evidence to suggest that the federal government continues to sponsor research where informed consent is not obtained and this fact disturbed me greatly also on august 15 1994 the new york times reported on ethical and legal questions regarding a companys efforts to promote a drug that can make some children grow taller than they otherwise would the drug in question protropin has been approved by fda for use in children whose bodies do not make sufficient quantities of human growth hormone however once approved doctors may prescribe it for other purposes at their discretion in this case the company was apparently surveying schools for short children and then trying to funnel those children to doctors who would prescribe the drug whether or not the children lacked the human growth hormone this unapproved research was occurring without the oversight of an irb and at least 15 000 children have taken this drug
5464677 specifically the advisory committee recommended that informed consent of all human subjects of classified research be required and that such requirement not be subject to waiver or exemption under current rule and executive order it is possible to waive informed consent and irb review for classified research title ii of this legislation would prohibit the waiver of either informed consent or irb review for classified research i do not claim to have the magic bullet solution with this bill however i believe there are some key principles which should guide the senates consideration of this legislation these principles are first informed consent and independent review of experiments involving human subjects must be required second anyone who violates the right of research subject to have informed consent should be held criminally responsible for that violation i want to put this in personal terms once again you can imagine your spouse husband wife father mother children being experimented on without your knowledge or their knowledge that is unconscionable and we should not permit that this legislation will close many of the loopholes that permit that to happen now

5464694 apparatus and method of broadcasting audible sound using ultrasonic sound as a carrier
5464695 since most cultures attribute inner voices either as a sign of madness or as messages from spirits or demons both of which evoke powerful emotional reactions
5464696 method of and apparatus for inducing desired states of consciousness
5464697 sounds and possibly even words which appear to be originating intracranially within the head can be induced by signal modulation at very low average power densities
5464698 great potential for development into a system for disorientating or disrupting the behavior patterns of military or diplomatic personnel
5464699 one decoy and deception concept presently being considered is to remotely create noise in the heads of personnel by exposing them to low power pulsed microwaves by proper choice of pulse characteristics intelligible speech may be created
5464700 designed in such a way that the burst frequencies are at least virtually equal to the sound frequencies of the sounds picked up by the microphone
5464701 could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security
5464702 it would also appear possible to create high fidelity speech in the human body raising the possibility of covert suggestion and psychological direction if a pulse stream is used it should be possible to create an internal acoustic field in the 5 15 kilohertz range which is audible thus it may be possible to talk to selected adversaries in a fashion that would be most disturbing to them

5464711 believed the beam would modify the behavior of the personnel
5464712 when the two frequencies mix in the human ear they become intolerable some people exposed to the device are said to feel giddy or nauseous and in extreme cases they faint most people are intensely annoyed by the device and have a compelling wish to be somewhere else

5464727 i was serving my country in their bold effort to fight communism
5464728 children were used as subjects because they were more fun to work with and cheaper too they needed lower profile subjects than soldiers and government people so only young willing females would do besides
5464729 i like scaring them they in the agency think i am a god creating subjects in experiments for whatever deviant purposes sid and james could think up
5464730 in order to keep more funding coming from different sources for radiation and mind control projects
5464731 it needed to be done faster then to get rid of the subjects or they were asking for us to come back later and haunt them with our remembrances
5464732 the jonestown experiment was conceived of by dr lawrence laird layton staffed by him and financed by layton
5464733 enhancing the economic and political powers of james warren jones
5464734 the church of set is a group with hundreds of members that operates on a national level aquino is the official head of the organization and rules through a council of nine who are in fact his lieutenants
5464735 another layer might well be the memory of seeing people hurt or even killed then they remember having seen babies killed another layer is realizing that they participated in the sacrifices one of the most painful memories may be that they even sacrificed their own baby
5464736 i have only seen those coming forth to get help they are in their twenties and thirties for the most part i can only assume that it is expanding geometrically and i am horrified the numbers represented by the generation who are now children and teenagers
5464737 that scientific evidence proved 60 of all women molested as children believed the experience was good for them
5464738 in his role of the leadership of the negro people
5464739 the problem was how do you find the people on the blacklist its not like you had their address and telephone number
5464740 i would have done a lot of things differently and been more cautious about getting us involved
5464741 a strategic disaster which cost us 57 000 lives and a half trillion dollars
5464742 the military and intelligence agencies were still scared by the excesses of mk ultra the infamous cia program that involved in part slipping lsd to unsuspecting victims
5464743 until recently anything that smacked of mind control was extremely dangerous
5464744 i would argue we threw the baby out with the bath water
5464745 maybe i can fix you or electronically neuter you so its safe to release you into society so you wont come back and kill me
5464746 where does that fall in the ethics spectrum thats a really tough question
5464747 in the warriors edge front line strategies for victory on the corporate battlefield a 1990 book he co authored with maj
5464748 as a special forces a team commander in thailand and vietnam he led hundreds of mercenaries into battle
5464749 at the same time he studied meditation in buddhist monasteries and later engaged in technical exploration and demonstration of advanced human performance
5464750 after retiring from the army in 1988 alexander joined the los alamos national laboratories and began working with janet morris the research director of the u s global strategy council usgsc chaired by dr ray cline former deputy director of the cia
5464751 born in new york in 1937 he spent part of his career as a commander of green berets special forces in vietnam led cambodian mercenaries behind enemy lines and took part in a number of clandestine programs including phoenix he currently holds the post of director of non lethal programs in the los alamos national laboratories
5464752 in 1971 while a captain in the infantry at schofield barracks honolulu he was diving in the biminis islands looking for the lost continent of atlantis he was an official representative for the silva mind control organization and a lecturer on pre cataclysmic civilizations alexander is also a past president and a board member of the international association for near death studies and with his former wife jan northup he helped dr c b scott jones perform esp experiments with dolphins
5464753 the total submission of ones will to some outside force
5464754 world opinion is not ready for dealing appropriately with the problems coming from the possibility of direct access to the human mind
5464755 kill an unshielded human being at a distance from five to ten miles
5464756 the human auditory system and a table radio may be one order of magnitude apart in sensitivity to rf energy
5464757 stimulating the nervous system without the damage caused by electrodes
5464758 did research on the effects of electromagnetic radiation on the brain for a pentagon weapons project
5464759 human experience of god can be generated by a process that has nothing to do with whether god exists or not
5464760 on the possibility of directly accessing every human brain by electromagnetic induction of fundamental algorithms
5464761 a process which is coupled to the narrow band of brain temperature could allow all normal human brains to be affected by a sub harmonic whose frequency range at 10 hz would only vary by 0 1 hz
5464762 random variations of noise within the matrices could potentially differentiate between individual brains
5464763 identification of these sequences could also allow direct access to the most complex neurocognitive processes associated with the self human consciousness and the aggregate of experimental representations episodic memory that define the individual within the brain
5464764 circumvented by direct induction of this information within the brain the basic premise is that synthetic duplication of the neuroelectrical correlates generated by sensors to an actual stimulus should produce identical experiences without the presence of that stimulus
5464765 the power levels for these amplitudes are similar to those associated with the signals generated globally by radio and communication systems within the last two decades a potential has emerged which was improbable but which is now marginally feasible this potential is the technical capability to influence directly the major portion of the approximately six billion brains of the human species by generating neural information within a physical medium within which all members of the species are immersed
5464766 psychotronic research is in its infancy but the us army already possesses an operational weapons system designed to do what lt col j b alexander would like esp to do except that this weapons system uses existing communications media it seeks to map the minds of neutral and enemy individuals and then change them in accordance with us national interests
5464767 it must strengthen our national will to victory and it must attack and ultimately destroy that of our enemy it both causes and is affected by physical combat but it is a type of war which is fought on a far more subtle basis as well in the minds of the national populations involved
5464768 if we do not attack the enemys will until he reaches the battlefield his nation will have strengthened it as best it can we must attack that will before it is locked into place we must instill in it a predisposition to inevitable defeat
5464769 strategic mindwar must begin the moment war is considered to be inevitable
5464770 for the mind to believe in its own decisions it must feel that it made those decisions without coercion coercive measures used by the operative consequently must not be detectable by ordinary means there is no need to resort to mind weakening drugs such as those explored by the cia in fact the exposure of a single such method would do unacceptable damage to mindwars reputation for truth
5464771 existing psyop identifies purely sociological factors which suggest appropriate idioms for messages doctrine in this area is highly developed and the task is basically one of assembling and maintaining individuals and teams with enough expertise and experience to apply the doctrine effectively this however is only the sociological dimension of target receptiveness measures there are some purely natural conditions under which minds may become more or less receptive to ideas and mindwar should take full advantage of such phenomena as atmospheric electromagnetic activity air ionization and extremely low frequency waves 21
5464772 if we do not accept excalibur then we relinquish our ability to inspire foreign cultures with our morality if they then desire moralities unsatisfactory to us we have no choice but to fight them on a more brutish level
5464773 the revolution in military affairs and conflicts short of war
5464774 that will not only change the nature of warfare but also alter the global geopolitical balance of power
5464775 we will have achieved a clear understanding of how the human brain works how it really controls the various functions of the body and how it can be manipulated both negatively and positively one can envision the development of electromagnetic energy sources the output of which can be pulsed shaped and focused that can couple with the human body in a fashion that will allow one to prevent voluntary muscle movements control emotions and thus actions produce sleep transmit suggestions interfere with both short term and long term memory produce an experience set and delete an experience set
5464776 it would also appear possible to create high fidelity speech in the human body raising the possibility of covert suggestion and psychological direction when a high power microwave pulse in the gigahertz range strikes the human body a very small temperature perturbation occurs this is associated with a sudden expansion of the slightly heated tissue this expansion is fast enough to produce an acoustic wave if a pulsed stream is used it should be possible to create an internal acoustic field in the 5 15 kilohertz range which is audible thus it may be possible to talk to selected adversaries in a fashion that would be most disturbing to them
5464777 the civilian population will likely accept an implanted microscopic microchip that allows military members to defend vital national interests
5464778 the california institute of technology has developed an energy efficient computer chip which emulates the analog thinking of the human brain when this capability is fully mature this chip could provide the baseline for a brain implant hooked to all the sensory segments of the brain not just the eye
5464779 an ethical and political revolution would be necessary to make a military revolution
5464780 there is another alternative we could deliberately engineer a comprehensive revolution seeking utter transformation rather than simply an expeditious use of new technology
5464781 i was complaining aloud to myself in my home that i couldnt find any d cell batteries i left to run errands the next day and when i came home my home had been entered again and i discovered that the kitchen drawer had 24 d cell batteries
5464782 i cant call up the police and tell them that someone broke into my home and deposited 24 d cell batteries
5464783 do whatever it takes to get me what i need
5464784 when they came for me there was no one left to protest
5464785 the plain dealer uncovered much evidence to suggest that the federal government continues to sponsor research where informed consent is not obtained and this fact disturbed me greatly also on august 15 1994 the new york times reported on ethical and legal questions regarding a companys efforts to promote a drug that can make some children grow taller than they otherwise would the drug in question protropin has been approved by fda for use in children whose bodies do not make sufficient quantities of human growth hormone however once approved doctors may prescribe it for other purposes at their discretion in this case the company was apparently surveying schools for short children and then trying to funnel those children to doctors who would prescribe the drug whether or not the children lacked the human growth hormone this unapproved research was occurring without the oversight of an irb and at least 15 000 children have taken this drug
5464786 specifically the advisory committee recommended that informed consent of all human subjects of classified research be required and that such requirement not be subject to waiver or exemption under current rule and executive order it is possible to waive informed consent and irb review for classified research title ii of this legislation would prohibit the waiver of either informed consent or irb review for classified research i do not claim to have the magic bullet solution with this bill however i believe there are some key principles which should guide the senates consideration of this legislation these principles are first informed consent and independent review of experiments involving human subjects must be required second anyone who violates the right of research subject to have informed consent should be held criminally responsible for that violation i want to put this in personal terms once again you can imagine your spouse husband wife father mother children being experimented on without your knowledge or their knowledge that is unconscionable and we should not permit that this legislation will close many of the loopholes that permit that to happen now
5464787 awake from sleep at night and without reason violently beat his wife and children later being unable to recall the entire incident
5464788 in experiments designed to test the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide lsd the government of the united states treated thousands of its citizens as though they were laboratory animals dosing them with this dangerous drug without their consent

5464791 stroboscopic flashing has also been considered for use against demonstrators in civil disturbances at 5 15 hz it can cause various physical symptoms and it is believed that it may initiate epileptic seizures in a small proportion of people the fact that flashing lights can precipitate epileptic fits has been known for many years possible military potential was investigated in the 1960s and a device known as the photic driver was developed by a british company allen international new scientist 29 march 1973 the use of a photic driver by south african police during interrogation of prisoners has been reported
5464792 calls for an international convention introducing a global ban on all developments and deployments of weapons which might enable any forms of manipulation of human beings

5464799 dearest heavenly father most good and gracious lord i love you with all my heart and soul and mind
5464800 i know that the government has been illegally watching me for years
5464801 implants are without a doubt the most invasive form of harassment electronic implants consist of transmitters esf generators micro neurophonic transceivers tracking devices and other micro sized devices designed to cause harassment by tracking or controlling movement and thought the most common implant was designed many years ago and is still used to this day it consists of a unit that is powered by bodily fluids and is capable of transmitting voice signals high voltage pulses emitting a small tracking beacon signal or other unspecified uses mind control

5464811 method of and apparatus for inducing desired states of consciousness
5464812 sounds and possibly even words which appear to be originating intracranially within the head can be induced by signal modulation at very low average power densities
5464813 great potential for development into a system for disorientating or disrupting the behavior patterns of military or diplomatic personnel
5464814 one decoy and deception concept presently being considered is to remotely create noise in the heads of personnel by exposing them to low power pulsed microwaves by proper choice of pulse characteristics intelligible speech may be created
5464815 designed in such a way that the burst frequencies are at least virtually equal to the sound frequencies of the sounds picked up by the microphone
5464816 could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security
5464817 it would also appear possible to create high fidelity speech in the human body raising the possibility of covert suggestion and psychological direction if a pulse stream is used it should be possible to create an internal acoustic field in the 5 15 kilohertz range which is audible thus it may be possible to talk to selected adversaries in a fashion that would be most disturbing to them

5464934 a very standard account structure in the international private banking industry including citibank

5464939 citigroup and chase not only assisted enron they developed the deceptive pre pays as a financial product and sold it to other companies as so called balance sheet friendly financing earning millions of fees for themselves in the process
5464940 the rationale for repealing glass steagall was that it would create more diversified banks and therefore more stability what i see in these mega banks is not diversification but more concentration of risk which puts the taxpayers on the hook

5464967 what once was a landmark and influential piece of entertainment is now slowly turning into some cosmic joke im sure his defense for this piece is that like the original films it is a fairytale for children
5464968 instead the film is a romp a burst of wall to wall action and high energy duels that plays merrily in the
5464969 the main problem for this film was pacing the battle sequences are incredible innovative and fun to watch but they are almost always going on the audience barely gets any relief from the war to reflect on what theyve seen
5464970 easily the worst film of 2008 so far george lucas should be ashamed also if people think im being overly harsh on a film designed for kids i should note that the screening i was at was full of kids and they were all restless or sleeping by the time the film was over

5464995 but if i dont zip up the emotional part of me sometimes i wont lead others effectively i have found that the soft side of being a musician and the strong side of being a leader sometimes work in opposition with each other
5464996 a leader must be strong enough to pick people up and take them on their destined place in life
5464997 it isnt appropriate for a leader to talk about how disaster filled her life is
5464998 leaders must get their eyes off themselves to inspire others to get up and walk on with their lord

5465041 la verdad es que veo a las chicas mejor que en otras oportunidades creo que si nos cuidamos en las jugadas fijas y jugamos concentrados los 70 minutos podemos ganarles no hay equipos imbatibles
5465042 los empates ante estados unidos y gran breta a nos obligaron a ganar los otros tres partidos y lo conseguimos apareci el temple de este equipo y estamos una vez m s en una semifinal lo que no es poco pero vamos por m s
5465043 conociendo ya los resultados de los partidos de alemania y gran breta a decid cuidar el f sico de las chicas pensamos en las semifinales y por eso le dimos m s minutos en cancha a jugadoras que habitualmente no tienen esa posibilidad y reservamos a otras
5465044 la vi tan prendida a sole que la dej m s tiempo en cancha jug un gran partido y es bueno que llegue as a los encuentros decisivos
5465045 no fue tan duro porque al entrar ya est bamos clasificadas y con los goles no se sufr a tanto pero seguimos buscando mejorar holanda es un equipo muy duro que est un pasito m s arriba hay que jugarle de igual a igual y aprovechar cada error o debilidad que tienen
5465046 es un partido diferente yo los disfruto mucho porque es un partido s per tensionado donde hay que estar superconcentrada al cien por cien que es para lo que se prepara una durante tanto tiempo
5465047 desgraciadamente es medio contradictorio cruzarse con holanda en una semifinal pero hay que ganar a todos los equipos para ganar una medalla de oro
5465048 si uno quiere apuntar a la medalla de oro le tiene que ganar a todos sabemos que holanda es un gran equipo pero nada es imposible y en los partidos que jugamos con ellas lo demostramos
5465049 el objetivo ahora es ganar los partidos que nos quedan pero primero est holanda que hoy por hoy es el mejor equipo del mundo pero repito queremos ganar la medalla de oro y vamos a hacer lo imposible para lograrlo
5465050 estamos muy contentas porque est el primer paso dado que era llegar a estar entre las cuatro primeras y pelear por una medalla ahora hay que seguir yendo para delante
5465051 este equipo cuando se propone algo lo logra y cuando dijimos que bamos a ganar los tres partidos que quedaban lo hicimos porque est bamos convencidas de que lo pod amos hacer igual en los dos primeros encuentros no se hab a jugado mal
5465052 vamos a mirar los videos de los partidos que jugamos con ellas en holanda para ver qu t ctica le podemos hacer hay que sacar la presi n que tienen ellas tanto en las volantes como las delanteras y sacar un poco el tab de decir jugamos con ellas es m s por la cabeza que por el juego porque somos dos equipos muy parejos
5465053 juega muy bien en todas sus l neas y tiene muy buen c rner corto
5465054 tendremos que defender muy bien y creo que nosotras podremos sacar la diferencia con algunos desequilibrios que tenemos ser un partido m s mental que otra cosa a ellas no les gusta jugar nada con nosotras
5465055 me hubiese gustado jugarlo en la final porque es un lindo partido para ver son los dos equipos mejores del torneo china ha hecho un buen torneo pero creo que nosotras somos m s equipo que china

5465075 the public doesnt know who on earth john mccain is
5465076 simply doesnt understand the challenges americas working families are facing because he isnt remotely affected by them
5465077 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5465078 the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5465079 mitchell did what has become a pattern for her of simply repeating obama campaign talking points
5465080 mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5465081 mitchell is repeating uncritically a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5465082 instead of trying to substantiate this blatant falsehood in any way andrea mitchell felt that she needed to repeat it on air to millions
5465083 cone of silence is a silly term i used from maxwell smart
5465084 we had him a green room in a totally different building
5465085 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
5465086 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
5465087 obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that

5465120 our board remains unwavering in its belief that eas unsolicited conditional tender offer of 25 74 per share was inadequate and undervalued world class entertainment franchises and our strong operational and financial performance
5465121 this deal comes down to leverage and agreeing on a price at least for the moment ea doesnt have a lot of leverage over take two and take two doesnt like the price ea has offered
5465122 take two is flying high right now as a result of the success of grand theft auto that makes it tougher to make a deal happen without paying a premium that blows them away
5465123 everybody has a number the question is will ea pay the price in order to get take two without knowing what magic number is its hard to gauge is it a 20 percent premium is it a 50 percent premium
5465124 it is a premium over their current market valuation but only the

5465168 nothing is out of the question on timing but the odds now favor an announcement no earlier than friday if obama moves sooner it will mean disrupting a schedule that is already set he will be in orlando tuesday for a speech to the vfw convention an important event that he probably wont want to overshadow with a vice presidential pick then he heads to north carolina and virginia for a bus tour on that runs into thursday if there is no announcement by then the orgy of speculation will be off the charts perhaps just as obamas advisers have planned

5465212 we may look at a different combination of openers for the next game but its at a very initial stage we have just gone through the first game so whatever fits the team best well decide on that
5465213 just remember fans take losses much harder than the majority of players do
5465214 hes got some talent there and made a couple of real nice throws
5465215 hes got some athletic skills running the ball its just a matter of him making good decisions and that comes with experience
5465216 well herm edwards has said from the start that its brodies job to lose not his job to win but his job to lose
5465217 so herm has committed not just in private to brodie but committed publicly that brodie is his guy and thats important for a young quarterbacks confidence
5465218 but then again they were trying to work on the running game
5465219 i think brodies decision making is good at least better than last year but the timing with the receivers is off

5465227 unlike many other sports it doesnt matter what you have done as far as results go leading up to the sec championships we want to build our confidence and work hard on our training throughout the season because having success at the conference meet is the most important thing for us this year

5465250 i just wanted to get back to life again swimming four hours a day and i wanted to be able to walk again so that i would be able to do things by myself

5465254 pro life womens groups should be rejected because theyre anti choice and theyre also anti equal rights they dont support equality
5465255 this is a group that is anti choice anti gay does not support equality for women and wants to obliterate the department on the status of women
5465256 this groups website even has links to sites that suggest that day cares do not care and homosexuality is a psychological disorder
5465257 some idea was put out by i dont know who a rumour or some source that the chair leads the discussion that is just not the case my view is im there to ensure that the meeting runs well and fairly and that the vote is taken fairly not to weigh in favour or against a particular candidate
5465258 the high standard of personal conduct required to be a member of the judiciary
5465259 our complaint to the canadian judicial council was never based on how beverley mclachlin voted it was based on how she chaired a council that showed such a lack of respect for the constitution the rule of law and the integrity of the supreme court and the misguided dismissal of the complaint by justice scott demonstrates a remarkably low level of respect and accountability to the one million people represented by the complaint
5465260 this is exactly why we must have a full investigation of the mclachlins conduct and the deliberations of the advisory council canadians deserve honesty and openness
5465261 throughout the process of awarding dr henry morgentaler the order of canada demonstrates bias political agenda and a wanton disregard for the constitution of the order of canada and time honoured regulations
5465262 in light of the role that she has assigned to herself id be surprised if many people would have a problem with the way that she carries out that particular role
5465263 is she now totally out of impartiality because of the fact she has weighed into this i am concerned about all of those things
5465264 i am concerned by the undenied reports that the council departed from its usual consensus rule in this instance
5465265 if thats true its very troublesome because it seems to me that the consensus rule exists precisely to avoid divisive and disruptive decisions if anyone on this council made a power play to override the usual consensus rule that would be very regrettable indeed
5465266 it is my opinion that in the eyes of most canadians the order of canada is usually bestowed on someone who has a story that unites us not divides us
5465267 to be attributable to a marked increase in post operative hemorrhage in the patients who underwent uppp 10 9 percent in smokers vs 3 3 percent in non smokers
5465268 men who underwent tonsillectomy alone bled significantly more than women 11 2 percent and 5 4 percent respectively
5465269 further investigation of this relationship is needed with stratification of patients by the number of cigarettes smoked and attention to the length of time before and or after surgery that patients refrain from smoking
5465270 the tracking system is deployed and working which is great news
5465271 we started ultrasonic tagging programs in maine in 1997 and have learned much about salmon ecology in the estuaries and bays of the gulf of maine
5465272 our team is really excited that fish from our most recent work in the penobscot river have been detected so far along on their migration northward the first data provided valuable information about how long it took atlantic salmon from the penobscot river to reach halifax
5465273 given the fact that we are looking for a fish that is still less than a foot long that could be anywhere in the northwest atlantic ocean finding them in such apparent concentrations hundreds of miles from brewer maine is remarkable and very encouraging
5465274 broad scale ocean arrays such as the halifax array are a great tool to examine the marine ecology of such an uncommon fish in a large marine environment
5465275 we have three scientists in the labrador sea right now working with canadian colleagues as part of the international salmon at sea salsea project to determine where atlantic salmon are and are not and to try to get detailed genetic and dietary information about the various north atlantic salmon stocks
5465276 atlantic salmon are an iconic fish but theyre endangered and people want to know whats happening to the population
5465277 this is the first step to finding out where the salmon are dying and whats causing the decline
5465278 we know specifically where a tagged salmon has been and when and that helps us fill in a big gap
5465279 the news is encouraging in 2008 more than 2 000 adult salmon returned to the penobscot river to spawn the highest annual total in more than 20 years research like this ultrasonic tagging project will help us understand why and perhaps then managers can work to actively improve atlantic salmon marine survival
5465280 our project is a response to the fact that the molecular systems people are building today are now so complex and their behavior so intricate that future progress hinges on developing the intellectual and practical tools for mastering that complexity the kinds of tools that computer science has already developed for silicon computers
5465281 the molecular programming project is one of the outputs from our investment in the information science and technology ist initiative over the years
5465282 the expeditions program is intended to identify future directions in computing that have the potential to lead to revolutionary changes the collaborations between the various investigators many of which were funded by ist were instrumental in bringing together the team of researchers who are embarking on this project
5465283 ambitious fundamental research agendas that promise to define the future of computing and information
5465284 it is important that people with epilepsy and their caregivers take steps to prevent these tragedies
5465285 people with active epilepsy should shower instead of bathe take medication regularly to control seizures and should have direct supervision when swimming
5465286 any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
5465287 appear to be withdrawing their forces back toward abkhazia and to the zone of conflict toward south ossetia
5465288 getting the russians back inside the zone of conflict and then back inside abkhazia and south ossetia it seems to me is the first objective
5465289 punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the long time russian sphere of influence
5465290 i think it would be unlikely for the united states to participate in the peacekeeping operations with our own troops
5465291 sometimes we love people so much that we have to be numb to it because if we actually felt how much we love them it would kill us

5465297 avoid or limit foods that contain high fructose corn syrup
5465298 the odds are that you have no chance with a team of just three but you gotta try
5465299 its a difficult track it was very technical yesterday and even more so today
5465300 the course builder is using the water fences very cleverly
5465301 the water is going to be a problem for a lot of riders
5465302 we had a mix up in the practice ring when he thought a shadow was a groundline but things like that dont bother him it just made him more attentive and he felt amazing in there my biggest worry was about the liverpool double but he soared over it its hard to believe how much he has come on over the last year in may 2007 we jumped in the super league in rome and it was too much for him but he has decided to peak at the right moment im thrilled with him
5465303 he is either a genius or a crazy horse and today he was a crazy crazy horse
5465304 i did too much with my horse in the warm up and halfway around the course i paid the price
5465305 he pushed me and pushed me and here we are now i owe him a great deal
5465306 and there have been a lot of good days but the olympic games have never gone my way so to be part of this is remarkable i want to say thanks to my great team and horses and to the team that have been behind us all
5465307 when macs horse was out this morning it didnt seem like we had any chance of a medal and then jill inspired us all with her great ride she left us no choice but to have a real go she set the standard and we had to follow
5465308 im going to try again for london ive picked out the horse already
5465309 when we qualified at the europeans last summer we didnt really believe we could go this far you dream that it might happen but this to us is as good as winning gold
5465310 finally we have a team riding at the same level at the same time and the team spirit has been unbelievable
5465311 the team have stuck to the plan we made two years ago and that is why we are here
5465312 i was a bit dazed and confused going into the jump off we werent really sure it was going to happen until the last minute and our horses were already going back to the stables there was no time to think about it i just knew going in that i needed to be clear and fast and it just turned into our night the canadians made us work for it though
5465313 i was sorry because i made my team jump in the jump off i should have sealed it in the second round but im glad how it worked out
5465314 results suggest that trainers under time constraints could increase their training effectiveness during the early stages of training by not feeding excess dietary energy
5465315 we dont want to give the impression that you should starve them in order to enhance their good behaviour
5465316 horses being ridden by less experienced riders need to be calm and easy to handle characteristics that may be enhanced by more effective early training
5465317 i can only say that we will not be leaving as fast as we came
5465318 medication issues continue to haunt this industry and they are and will continue to be a priority for this committee as evidenced by several of todays recommendations
5465319 we once again vigorously encourage the respective industry organisations to act on these recommendations in a timely manner
5465320 i didnt know whether to congratulate you or be upset at you because it might mean that i will have to crew again for my dad fred boethling previous oldest male solo finisher

5465362 hai sekalian manusia bertakwalah kepada tuhan mu yang telah menciptakan kamu dari diri yang satu dan daripadanya allah menciptakan isterinya dan daripada keduanya allah memperkembang biakkan laki laki dan perempuan yang banyak dan bertakwalah kepada allah yang dengan mempergunakan nama nya kamu saling meminta satu sama lain dan peliharalah hubungan silaturrahim sesungguhnya allah selalu menjaga dan mengawasi kamu
5465363 pernikahan adalah separuh agama maka bertakwalah pada separuh yang tersisa
5465364 kesombongan adalah selendangku siapa yang menandingi aku akan aku masukkan neraka
5465365 tiap jumat siang kami berangkat ke daerah puncak bogor untuk pesta miras dan narkoba
5465366 mereka dengan kesahajaan bisa menemukan kebahagiaan apakah di masjid ada kebahagiaan
5465367 rasanya seluruh otakku tiba tiba dipenuhi oleh kekaguman dan entah kenapa aku seperti mendapatkan ketenangan melihat orang orang ruku sujud dalam kekhusuan
5465368 bukankah apa yang kulakukan selama ini untuk mendapatkan ketenangan tapi kenapa tidak ya aku telah bergelut dengan kesalahan dan tetek bengeknya yang semuanya adalah dosa benarkah allah tidak akan mengampuni dosaku lantas buat apa aku hidup jika jelas jelas bergelimang dalam ketidakbahagiaan
5465369 selama hidupku baru kali ini aku diliputi suatu perasaan yang belum pernah aku rasakan semenjak mulai memasuki dunia selebritis maka aku pun segera berwudlu dan melakukan shalat ketika itu untuk pertama kalinya pula aku merasakan kebahagiaan dan kedamaian dan sejak hari itu aku memutuskan untuk tekun memperdalam agama sekalipun masih banyak sekali tawaran tawaran menggiurkan yang disodorkan kepadaku atau pun beragam ejekan dari sebagian orang aku pun melaksanakan haji seraya berdiri dan menangis di hadapan kabah memohon kepada allah kiranya mengampuni dosa dosa yang telah aku lakukan pada hari hari hitamku
5465370 saat aku sudah belajar agama aku tidak berupaya menyuruhnya shalat ia tiba tiba belajar shalat sendiri begitu juga anak anak suatu hari ketika aku pulang tiba tiba aku mendapatinya tengah mematut diri di depan kaca sambil mengenakan jilbab padahal aku tidak pernah menyuruhnya subhanallah istriku memang yang terbaik yang pernah diberikan allah
5465371 kata beliau aku jadi lebih kalem ketimbang dulu meski sekarang pakai jenggot segala bahkan aku jadi menantu favoritnya lho
5465372 mengapa allah memberikan hidayah kepada diriku yang kerdil ini mengapa allah menciptakan makhluk yang penuh dosa ini
5465373 ternyata allah menciptakanku untuk menjadi manusia baik semula mengikuti idolaku mick jagger aku menjadi penyanyi dan rekaman lalu mendapat honor tapi itu bukan kebahagiaan sepenuhnya buatku
5465374 mick jagger itu dulu menjadi idolaku ikut mabok main cewek dan seabrek dunia kelam lain tapi sekarang aku mengidolakan nabi dan sekarang aku menemukan nikmat yang tiada tara
5465375 aku sudah mendapatkan banyak hal di dunia ini sekarang saatnya mengumpulkan amal untuk persiapan menghadapi hari akhir
5465376 dalam hidup ini apa pun agamanya adalah paling baik mengikuti ajaran agama karena inilah yang akan membentengi kita terutama anak anak dalam menjalani cobaan hidup
5465377 tak hanya berkurang namun dosa kang gito bahkan sudah dianggap lunas kang gito jangan berpikir perbuatan baik saat ini untuk bayar dosa yang lalu sekarang kang gito tengah menabung untuk masa depan

5465382 so for me the goal right now should be and this is where i think we can find common ground and by the way ive now inserted this into the democratic party platform is how do we reduce the number of abortions

5465421 i dont really want to be a priest i just want to help people so ill just go through this ridiculous amount of training to do it
5465422 its kind of a trend when it comes to issues of canada u s relations and contentious issues like military integration
5465423 we see that this government is reluctant to disclose information to canadians that is readily available on american and mexican websites
5465424 this document is a unique bilateral military plan to align our respective national military plans to respond quickly to the other nations requests for military support of civil authorities
5465425 in discussing the new bilateral civil assistance plan established by usnorthcom and canada command renuart stressed
5465426 the signing of this plan is an important symbol of the already strong working relationship between canada command and u s northern command
5465427 our commands were created by our respective governments to respond to the defense and security challenges of the twenty first century
5465428 and we both realize that these and other challenges are best met through cooperation between friends

5465442 to make sure that the virus that causes smallpox would remain in storage awaiting a new opportunity to terrorize the world for decades both countries stored it distributed it to various research labs and otherwise ensured that this public health victory would be turned into a potential human tragedy

5465444 the unresolved story of abc news false saddam anthrax reports
5465445 i do think this is one of the most underreported issues of the past 10 years
5465446 the reality is that in many respects the middle class of this country is collapsing the vast majority of our people have seen a decline in their standard of living
5465447 seven years of flat or declining wages seven years of increasing costs and seven year of mounting debts have placed unprecedented stress on the ordinary families by every critical financial measure these families are losing ground without changes in critical economic policies the strong middle class that has been the backbone of the american economy and the american democracy is in jeopardy

5465460 i expect us to have for the first time in 28 years at least one democrat in the congressional delegation
5465461 i expect senator ted stevenss chances of survival are better than those of congressman don young
5465462 the last time we had this level of socialism being proposed and inexperience at the helm was jimmy carter
5465463 well hes promoting what i would term a government takeover of the health system
5465464 he has said he wants to mandate free college tuition for every student in america
5465465 unlike ted kennedy he meant jack kennedy of course who said dont ask what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country he obama says were the wealthiest country in the world you should get this you should get that youre entitled to this youre entitled to that to me thats a move toward socialism
5465466 im familiar with what his work was here at the state capitol and to me the best indicator of future behavior is past behavior
5465467 and he has supported what i would consider to be socialistic moves on health care as a state senator
5465468 the expansion of the schip program represents a truly common sense and bipartisan solution that is plaguing many families especially those in our ninth congressional district

5465472 my familys about the same age as her family its not my favorite strip but its one of the handful that i read
5465473 my preference in all cases is to present fresh original content to our audience on all platforms i may keep a strip going with reruns during a brief break but im hesitant to go back in time for a comic thats half and i suspect it will be more recycled material
5465474 tell me what you think we should do keep for better or for worse watch the first month or two and then decide or thank lynn johnston for 29 wonderful years and give another comic a chance to become a favorite
5465475 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence
5465476 what were looking at is a fire sale of properties in newer affordable neighborhoods that were bought or refinanced near the price peak with lousy mortgages
5465477 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
5465478 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined
5465479 by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending
5465480 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
5465481 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
5465482 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
5465483 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
5465484 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
5465485 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
5465486 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
5465487 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
5465488 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
5465489 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
5465490 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
5465491 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
5465492 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
5465493 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
5465494 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

5465498 the list of credentialed blogs include radical sites like the daily kos worse are blogs that feature anti catholic and obscene material the two most offensive are bitch ph d and towleroad
5465499 both of these blogs should be cut immediately from the list of credentialed sites neither functions as a responsible media outlet and both offend catholics as well as others to allow them access to the democratic national convention sends a message to catholics they will not forget we look for leah daughtry ceo of the convention to nix them asap

5465534 we might have overwhelmed japan a little bit it was tough for them they were already out of it
5465535 its not that i didnt expect great things out of this unbelievable lineup but just the relentlessness we just keep on pounding i mean nine runs in an inning thats just unreal
5465536 for 10 years ive been working as hard as i can and have sacrificed so many things to lose that game over and over again has been just devastating
5465537 to come out today and be in that final four its a great feeling were definitely the underdog story

5465550 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order

5465554 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual

5465622 when krs was big when the bridge is over was big when it was a dis song but it wasnt a beef song when the nature of hip hop was beautiful no matter what the face of it was that day the outcome was always dope man from the spice 1s to the kool g raps thats what i miss when hip hop evolved and changed and got thrown in a bucket of kool aid somebody threw too much sugar in it now it tastes a little funny thats why i say hip hop broke my heart when i got in i thought it would preserve itself long enough to at least let me see the hip hop i was used to the hip hop i fell in love with but it didnt do that hip hop left the job for me to continue on and still pay homage to the way of old me and hip hop be beefing sometimes but no matter what face hip hop makes im gonna evolve with it

5465632 its impossible to transfer into english the cultural traditions and the associations of language
5465633 there is or used to be a kind of indian writer who used many italics and for the excitement had a glossary of perfectly simple local words at the back of his book narayan never did that he explains little or nothing he talks everything about his people and his little town for granted
5465634 english is a part of my intellectual rational make up tamil my emotional psychic make up
5465635 national colouring is like naivete if you realize you have it then you have already lost it conception of the indian through indian eyes is natural and this only determine the scope of literary subject

5465643 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5465644 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5465645 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly

5465655 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5465656 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5465657 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5465658 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
5465659 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
5465660 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
5465661 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
5465662 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
5465663 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
5465664 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

5465711 the fifth blackbird some thoughts on economically sustainable digital preservation
5465712 w e still lack a systematic analysis of digital preservation as an economic activity and how it can be adequately provisioned with resources over the long term to ensure that preservation objectives are met in a wide variety of contexts and circumstances a lack of economically sustainable models for digital preservation activities represents just as real a threat to the long term persistence of digital materials as the more traditional scourges of media decay and technological obsolescence
5465713 it is unrealistic to assume that all or even most institutions with a stake in the long term persistence of digital collections will be able to install and maintain local digital preservation capacity to achieve their preservation objectives in these circumstances it is likely that a network of preservation repositories will emerge and indeed in some cases have emerged that will carry out preservation activities on behalf of other organizations either as part of a collaborative effort or in the form of a service offered through traditional market mechanisms developing economic strategies that ensure a sustained flow of resources from those who require or benefit from digital preservation services to those who are willing to perform digital preservation services is an essential aspect of economical sustainability

5465947 as n scias ao tomarem as suas l mpadas n o levaram azeite consigo
5465948 no entanto as prudentes al m das l mpadas levaram azeite nas vasilhas
5465949 e tardando o noivo foram todas tomadas de sono e adormeceram
5465950 mas meia noite ouviu se um grito eis o noivo sa ao seu encontro
5465951 ent o se levantaram todas aquelas virgens e prepararam as suas l mpadas
5465952 e as n scias disseram s prudentes dai nos do vosso azeite porque as nossas l mpadas est o se apagando
5465953 mas as prudentes responderam n o para que n o nos falte a n s e a v s outras ide antes aos que o vendem e comprai o
5465954 e saindo elas para comprar chegou o noivo e as que estavam apercebidas entraram com ele para as bodas e fechou se a porta
5465955 mais tarde chegaram as virgens n scias clamando senhor senhor abre nos a porta

5465969 o nosso lado se dividiu tucanos e democratas o geraldo alckmin resolveu sair candidato est caindo nas pesquisas estamos nos aproximando dele e vamos pass lo ele vai nos apoiar no segundo turno
5465970 uma coisa bastante significativa nesta elei o os candidatos terem a necessidade de at porque dois dos principais advers rios j tiveram cargos na vida p blica se apropriar de obras ou id ias de nossa administra o
5465971 a ex prefeita marta suplicy apenas porque ela tinha vontade de fazer o hospital mboi mirim zona leste queria fazer o hospital mas n o fez preferiu fazer t neis viadutos plantar coqueiro mas ela foi fazer uma visita ao hospital dizendo que aquilo era obra dela
5465972 dont worry bout a thing cause every little thing is going to be alright
5465973 in conclusion we feel that the evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of stay
5465974 the potential benefits to individual patients in health economics terms are such that a well designed large scale blinded randomized controlled trial with a placebo arm is warranted to answer the question of whether gum chewing can significantly reduce the length of stay after abdominal surgery or whether it merely represents a placebo effect
5465975 in adults there has been evidence that less than six hours of sleep a night was associated with high blood pressure levels
5465976 that was one of the more unique findings that poor sleep quality is associated with high blood pressure
5465977 to see how their blood pressure is developing over time
5465978 it does point to the direction that the next studies need to go to understand what less sleep and less efficient sleep mean in terms of blood pressure
5465979 but the changes in the diurnal patterns for adolescents make it harder for them to get up in the morning and to get to sleep at night if we reorganize the day night schedule for adolescents that could make life easier for them and their parents
5465980 we do know that in adults poor sleep and a diminished amount of sleep are associated with obesity and hormone intolerance
5465981 changes occur in the sympathetic nervous system also fragmentary sleep activates inflammatory pathways
5465982 optimizing sleep hygiene following regular sleep habits turning the light off approximately the same time every night keeping the bedroom quieter and avoiding substances that may disturb sleep such as caffeine
5465983 im not sure i would call it a bias because that word has negative connotations but in general people do seem to have unconscious blind spots when it comes to the elderly
5465984 so not only ems staff but also those receiving patients at trauma centers are operating on subjective assumptions as to what elderly patients need how aggressively they should be treated and what hospitals can do for them rather than on clear and standard protocol codes and trauma recommendations
5465985 and as a result as patients get older they are less likely to get into a trauma center
5465986 so the hope now is to identify this blind spot problem so that we can maybe help ems staff try to catch on and adjust their thinking and attitudes and in turn change their behavior
5465987 i think in general that most providers tend to worry more about the elderly and recognize that they are more at risk and want to get them better care
5465988 and i have to say that ive certainly never seen any evidence of an elderly bias in my practice before here in boston or elsewhere so it makes me wonder if there are other factors at play that the research didnt get at
5465989 for example older people often have complex medical problems and very strong relationships with doctors at a particular center
5465990 so ems providers might perfectly well decide to take an older patient to where they are best known or even respond to a patient request to do so whether or not that center is a trauma center
5465991 highly unlikely that these patient would have been able or have the time to express any preference of care
5465992 and there might be a subset of patients that do better elsewhere
5465993 so in my opinion what the study primarily tells us is that further research is needed
5465994 says its not what you wear that makes you sexy its who you are and how much you like who you are
5465995 i want to put together two outfits a really sexy one and a not so sexy one then ill compare peoples reactions
5465996 yll talking dumb ya know that you dont have to test the truth just be yourself
5465997 ive been around the most beautiful women in the world sexy comes from a womans honesty intelligence and attitude both about herself and how she treats others its the depth of her integrity not the depth of cleavage that counts
5465998 why do so many of us spend so much time and money trying to dress like someone elses definition of sexy
5465999 girl havent you figured out comparing yourself is the path to insecurity
5466000 what we really need to be doing is getting rid of things that dont reflect the real you like this here thing
5466001 i think michael jacksons signature is on one of the cuffs
5466002 because im not seeing much that reflects a woman in her forties
5466003 be the sexy iceberg that powerful presence that can sink a titantic without doing a darn thing
5466004 i saw a shot of christie brinkley during her divorce court appearance she was wearing a khaki pencil skirt black belt and a crisp white form fitted blouse her hair and make up were simply styled she was in turmoil but her entire essence said class and internal fortitude and she looked sexy
5466005 im also getting that you solved my problem of what to wear nothing
5466006 love yourself girl and the right clothes will follow clothes like dkny and calvin kline
5466007 i called to suggest you and insert hubbs name and thats when they told me

5466019 the big boss unveiled the pledge at our last company wide meeting for our division meeting this friday i would like you all to prepare some comments about how the pledge directly applies to your job both how you have been using it and how you can use it going forward
5466020 how we have been using it what were supposed to apply it retroactively
5466021 i dont think its meant to be used its more like a guide a point of reference for doing our jobs this sucks
5466022 it seems to me this pledge isnt so much something to be applied as it is a point of reference for making business decisions
5466023 actually i was one of the ones that worked on the pledge
5466024 it was sort of fun hammering out ideas putting them down in writing
5466025 theres been a bit of discussion recently about what exactly the pledge is for

5466046 very rare case reports of pancreatitis with complications or with a fatal outcome
5466047 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5466048 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5466049 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5466050 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that

5466060 we dont have any data yet that says taking an otherwise healthy adult whos vitamin d deficient and supplementing them prevents cancer reduces the risk of heart disease
5466061 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5466062 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant

5466100 in corporations run by men for generations women overwhelming play large roles as change agents and promoting new ideas and as a result they have developed a perfect combination of skills that makes them great innovators strong values good collaborators and a keen eye for unfulfilled client needs make them natural innovators
5466101 women working in the insurance industry can take small steps everyday to try and improve the overall industry performance which has been lackluster at best
5466102 the lack of female innovators in the insurance industry is also a lack of ceo vision in some areas
5466103 in an industry with generally weak overall performance that number is not exponential
5466104 she is one of the best thinkers in the insurance industry gliding back and forth between insurance and innovation

5466106 city buses operated in every community driving new yorkers to work school the hospital and family visits but riders never knew their drivers and the mechanics who maintained the bus fleet were unknowingly exposed to hazardous diesel fumes every day back in the depots

5466108 the original cluster of plaintiffs includes 11 surviving workers and family members representing two deceased plaintiffs it is likely that the number of plaintiffs will increase over time as more of the former workers or their living family members realize that there is a link between the fatal diseases that plague them and the conditions at their job sites
5466109 since literally millions of other workers in the transportation construction railroad and package delivery industries faced similar diesel fume exposure conditions resulting in heart and lung malignancies it is anticipated that additional lawsuits will follow this initial one

5466157 in the past few years drivers in illinois have done a great job of buckling up and helping to drastically reduce the overall number of traffic fatalities in our state
5466158 however we havent seen a corresponding reduction in alcohol related fatalities thats why idot is working with the illinois state police and hundreds of police agencies across the state to get impaired drivers off our roads and to keep our families safe
5466159 in 2006 in illinois 594 people died in alcohol related crashes that is nearly 50 lives per month
5466160 the message we want to share today is simple if you drive drunk we will arrest you i am proud to partner with idot isp and local law enforcement agencies for this important initiative every drunk driving fatality is one too many
5466161 illinois has seen a historic drop in traffic fatalities under the leadership of governor blagojevich to levels we havent seen since 1924
5466162 but with more than 45 percent of our states traffic fatalities involving alcohol we know we need to continue aggressively attacking the problem of drunk drivers increased enforcement is a way to save more lives as summer is winding down we are putting the public on notice if you drink and drive you are going to lose
5466163 the labor day holiday is considered to be the last chapter of the summer season and many individuals celebrate throughout the weekend
5466164 for those who elect to drive while intoxicated be forewarned that the isp and our law enforcement partners will have zero tolerance toward impaired driving if you choose to drive while intoxicated you will be arrested

5466259 today one of the leading salafist figures in the north dai al islam al shahhal identifies the salafist movement as the true face of islam
5466260 our goal is a call to go back to the basics of islam

5466263 the first role consists of informing citizens of the different kinds of information they are interested in while the second consists of playing the role of a public guard that tackles issues in favor of public interest and uncovers corruption which the states bodies fail to defy
5466264 the public has the right to know everything particularly issues that interest it
5466265 it is a sacred right which media outlets cannot handle with reservation and self censorship because this way they will lose their main role

5466273 on the map of the world pakistan is now an important country by the grace of allah
5466274 president bush is committed to a strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5466275 any attempt to overstep this mechanism aims at changing the dialogues agenda
5466276 if the participants would like to expand the dialogue we could add some other issues but then we would be canceling parliaments role
5466277 we are not saying that to turn our back to discussing a defense strategy for lebanon but to say that there are other important issues which need to be discussed during national dialogue sessions
5466278 we need to address economic and social issues as well as ways to implement the decisions that were taken during earlier dialogue sessions
5466279 social and economic issues should not be discussed during dialogue sessions they should rather be dealt with by the government only
5466280 we still need syria to acknowledge lebanons ownership of the disputed territory in an official document that should be sent to the united nations to end the border dispute once and for all
5466281 the two cases are not the same syrias armed forces and intelligence were the ones operating in lebanon and not the other way around
5466282 i believe the former government was involved in terrorism since it did not take any measures to stop it from spreading
5466283 this privilege should be given to the deputy premier who should not remain marginalized
5466284 eight years have lapsed since the pullout from lebanon and with it the arrival of numerous sla fighters who assisted the israeli army and who are presently complaining about inequality in their absorption in israel
5466285 the protesters feel betrayed by the defense ministry which they believe abandoned them after many years of service
5466286 we are fighting now in order to live as we should we cant do this
5466287 i came here eight years ago with my husband and children we were in the sla we had true peace with israel after the israeli military pullout from lebanon we didnt know what to do they neglected us
5466288 we came to this country and we know that people receive all their rights here for eight years they didnt know how to absorb us like they should have they divided us
5466289 we reached a point where a lot of people arent working and we cannot continue living this way because it is really hard
5466290 we are asking for equality what is happening now is unjust we worked with the defense ministry not with the ministry of immigrant absorption and they threw us out like dogs
5466291 there are 460 families with nothing to eat we have no one to represent us if i have a problem i have no one to turn to we are thrown up into the air
5466292 us and israeli policies that aim at inciting strife and dividing muslim ranks
5466293 i would like to thank hariri and former minister and future mp samir al jisr for their cooperation and backing of our move
5466294 i heard in the media that the memorandum was approved by hariri and myself i care to clarify that this was not the case
5466295 a salafist delegation visited me on sunday and told me about its plans to sign such a memo with hizbullah but this does not give me the privilege to accept or reject such a move
5466296 we welcome such a move we are against violence and we repeatedly said that most salafist groups are also against violence
5466297 communication between salafist groups and hizbullah helps in avoiding sectarian violence in lebanon
5466298 this document is harmful to the sunni community and would end up in vain god willing
5466299 those who signed have no influence and whoever wants to defuse tension should talk to forces that do exist

5466301 innocent civilians on independence day the terrorists showed their hostility to the freedom of the afghan people

5466306 shocked by this senseless and barbaric attack on one of our staff
5466307 the afghans did not go to canada to kill canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghans to please the fascist regime of america
5466308 remains steadfast in our commitment to the people of afghanistan and will continue to work with the afghan government and the international community to improve the lives of afghans
5466309 what the parliament has done today was constitutional the procrastination of the opposition and its failure to fulfill its promises is against the constitution
5466310 the opposition parties want us to subjugate laws and the parliament to their wishes and even want to postpone elections for another year this is unacceptable
5466311 regrettably the parliament was transformed today into a crisis creation arena instead of being a place to solve crises gpc mps have created a new crisis by their decision
5466312 its the start of a change in tactics in dealing with crowd control and dispersing violent demonstrations and violent instances
5466313 it protects the protestors because it doesnt require us to use tear gas and rubber bullets
5466314 they use all kinds of violence against us but we have to get our land back we are willing to sacrifice ourselves
5466315 anyone who wants to can live in this country the problem for us is that they took our land
5466316 its not a chemical it is a smelling liquid it doesnt cause any harm or any physical damage whatsoever even if it gets in peoples eyes

5466322 i dont think bellemare is going to announce hes ready tomorrow
5466323 given current forecasts it does not appear that fay will impact shell gulf of mexico assets therefore we have concluded evacuations
5466324 as a precautionary measure shell had reduced staffing levels by evacuating 425 personnel if the storm remains on its current track there will be no further evacuations and we now begin planning the safe redeployment of those personnel

5466328 the most efficient method to commit genocide today in front of our eyes is gang rapes rapes against girls and rapes against 70 year old women babies born as a result have been called janjaweed babies and this has led to an explosion of infanticide bashir is executing this genocide without gas chambers without bullets and without machetes the desert will do it for them hunger is the weapon of this genocide as well as rape

5466339 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5466340 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5466341 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5466342 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5466343 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5466344 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5466345 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5466346 if its only one day and then its cool afterwards its not a problem
5466347 but usually these heat waves last for some days and it becomes a health problem
5466348 what im personally very concerned about is the middle east and northern india its a heavily populated area and its already very hot there today but it will become much hotter there so they will experience temperatures that will reach up to 125 degrees fahrenheit
5466349 there its not very easy for people to turn on the air conditioning or to pick up and move just because they dont have as many resources
5466350 my preliminary research on india suggests that the impacts on mortality could be quite dramatic
5466351 i think its becoming clearer and clearer that the costs of climate change wont be spread evenly around the globe unfortunately theyre going to be concentrated in countries least able to deal with them just due to low income levels
5466352 changes in temperature are not going to accrue overnight so there will be a lot of time to adapt
5466353 hatfield amp mccoy situation but we knew what we felt and were moving forward

5466357 the idea of trying to utilize the white spaces from a consumer perspective would be a good win for everyone
5466358 google has a clear business interest in expanding access to the web theres no doubt that if these airwaves are opened up to unlicensed use more people will be using the internet thats certainly good for google not to mention many of our industry peers but we also think that its good for consumers

5466360 if were going to improve safety and health conditions it has to happen on the ground
5466361 and it only happens with strong local unions and active and engaged members who identify hazards and issues in the workplace
5466362 its been a tough 7 years with george bush and elaine chao as secretary of labor kojola said
5466363 there have been relentless attacks on safety and health and the government agencies that are responsible for protecting workers the occupational safety and health administration osha and the mine safety and health administration msha have abandoned their focus on workers
5466364 for 7 1 2 years the labor department has neglected the workers its supposed to protect
5466365 the message from the bush administration is you dont have to do a lot and blaming workers is ok he said
5466366 how can any politician look a farm worker in the face and say no you dont deserve a toilet or clean drinking water shameful shameful said kojola
5466367 i see a new opportunity to move forward here and turn this thing around
5466368 we have to have strong local unions so we can send a message to congress and our politicians that workers are demanding a new day
5466369 workers are demanding that the safety and health conditions and the environment in this country change
5466370 resolution one i will live for god resolution two if no one else does i still will
5466371 no decision has been made about the teams yet but we are very keen to go and be one of the clubs involved in the first afl match played over there
5466372 its a great opportunity there are growing cultural and population ties between india and australia the tigers being a revered animal in that country would be a perfect fit for the indian market
5466373 its a tremendous opportunity and would fit right in with our clubs history of developing the game with different cultures and communities we would even make a financial contribution to meet some of the costs if required
5466374 we hope to have an announcement in four to six weeks
5466375 but we are not in a position to say anything further at this stage as we are in a number of negotiations
5466376 there are still some negotiations to be done over the dates
5466377 if you are going to showcase the sport overseas then its best to be serious about it and play games that mean something and make an impression
5466378 with numbers like these from michael phelps we felt it was critical to find a place for him on our network on latenight
5466379 michael is funny and has a wonderful personality and will be a great host on the tonight show and we expect to keep these stunning ratings
5466380 there was zero chance of interference to tv or wireless microphone signals
5466381 chomping at the bit to build devices as soon as the rules get written

5466386 lifes most urgent question is what are you doing for others
5466387 ive talked with people who usually vote republican who are so happy to see a candidate attacking the problems rather than their opponent
5466388 i always looked forward to turning 18 so i could vote
5466389 i never expected it to be this historic and i definitely didnt expect to be at the convention i guess im lucky to be turning 18 at this time in history
5466390 there were over 20 candidates some of them longtime local activists vying for three slots

5466399 the penalties are strong and swift as we have shown
5466400 financially i dont see how this company can survive people need to be responsible and from s standpoint they will be held responsible they broke the rules that does not mean the rules are wrong i believe the rules are adequate
5466401 these images exposed wholly unacceptable gaps in american meat inspection systems
5466402 despite the presence of five inspectors at the westland hallmark plant blatant violations had evidently occurred for some time i think we need a more foolproof system
5466403 i do believe there are cases where downer animals can be approved by the veterinarian and put into the food supply
5466404 we need a rigorous inspections program because reckless behavior by a single company can have national and global implications
5466405 how many other crises recalls and public scares can we tolerate before we adopt an unambiguous policy of combating mad cow in the food supply we need a bright line on this

5466531 in the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an american and assimilates himself to us he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birthplace or origin but this is predicated upon the persons becoming in every facet an american and nothing but an american there can be no divided allegiance here any man who says he is an american but something else also isnt an american at all we have room for but one flag the american flag we have room for but one language here and that is the english language and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the american people
5466532 let us say to the immigrant not that we hope he will learn english but that he has got to
5466533 by the use of the hyphen and along the lines of national origin is certain to a breed of spirit of bitterness and prejudice and dislike between great bodies of our citizens if some citizens band together as german americans or irish americans then after a while others are certain to band together as english americans or scandinavian americans and every such banding together every attempt to make for political purposes a german american alliance or a scandinavian american alliance means down at the bottom an effort against the interest of straight out american citizenship an effort to bring into our nation the bitter old world rivalries and jealousies and hatreds

5466539 e lecito reindirizzare gli utenti che vogliamo collegarsi a pirate bay al sito della ifpi
5466540 i hope that people start noticing that ifpi gets more and more into bed with the police its really disturbing that one side of an ongoing fight gets more authority without a legal basis
5466541 this decision sends out a clear message that the pirate bays activities are illegal under italian law the pirate bay facilitates the mass infringement of copyright across music film television and games its very name shows the contempt its operators hold for the creators of legitimate content

5466548 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
5466549 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business
5466550 of course pharmaceutical companies make a huge investment into public health when they develop a new medicine it costs on average 550m and takes more than 10 years to bring each new treatment to patients
5466551 naturally companies will look to recoup such costs through the final price
5466552 we have a finite amount of money for healthcare and if you spend money one way you cant spend it in another

5466565 people in illinois will now have added protection from cyberbullying a serious threat in todays increasingly technological society
5466566 cyberbullying is a new but troubling problem that needs to be addressed
5466567 this bill takes real steps to deterring this criminal behavior and i am pleased to see the governor sign it into law
5466568 numerous other states have taken the initiative and passed laws targeting cyberbullying i am pleased that illinois has joined those states in the fight to protect its citizens against these harmful and hurtful acts
5466569 with the advancement of technology law enforcement has observed an increase in criminal activity that has stemmed from electronic communications
5466570 law enforcement agencies throughout the state will now be able hold those individuals accountable that continue to torment or terrorize by unwanted or unwarranted electronic statements the cyberbullying law will give everyone including our children the protection to use their electronic devices without fear of receiving a threat or becoming a victim of harassing and obscene communications

5466573 these deals can be viewed as opportunistic attempts by larger deep pocketed private equity sponsors to maximize risk adjusted returns in an environment where there are few outlets for traditional strategies such as buyouts
5466574 allocations to private equity could increase in the near term as other investors underexposed to the asset class increasingly view sponsors as an appropriate vehicle for extracting superior risk adjusted returns in leveraged finance
5466575 their purchase of leveraged loans constitutes a new frontier in their investment strategy and is motivated by their search to put ample funds to work and maximize returns in an environment where opportunities for more conventional buyout activity are highly limited

5466654 3 two errors are here to be avoided some make man a fellow worker with god in such a sense that mans suffrage ratifies election so that according to them the will of man is superior to the counsel of god as if scripture taught that only the power of being able to believe is given us and not rather faith itself others although they do not so much impair the grace of the holy spirit yet induced by what means i know not make election dependent on faith as if it were doubtful and ineffectual till confirmed by faith there can be no doubt indeed that in regard to us it is so confirmed moreover we have already seen that the secret counsel of god which lay concealed is thus brought to light by this nothing more being understood than that that which was unknown is proved and as it were sealed but it is false to say that election is then only effectual after we have embraced the gospel and that it thence derives its vigor it is true that we must there look for its certainty because if we attempt to penetrate to the secret ordination of god we shall be engulfed in that profound abyss but when the lord has manifested it to us we must ascend higher in order that the effect may not bury the cause for what can be more absurd and unbecoming than while scripture teaches that we are illuminated as god has chosen us our eyes should be so dazzled with the brightness of this light as to refuse to attend to election meanwhile i deny not that in order to be assured of our salvation we must begin with the word and that our confidence ought to go no farther than the word when we invoke god the father for some to obtain more certainty of the counsel of god which is nigh us in our mouth and in our heart deut 30 14 absurdly desire to fly above the clouds we must therefore curb that temerity by the soberness of faith and be satisfied to have god as the witness of his hidden grace in the external word provided always that the channel in which the water flows and out of which we may freely drink does not prevent us from paying due honor to the fountain

5466738 they were seen wearing the uniform of the russian army and wielding russian weapons several people carrying photo and video equipment were seen with them too
5466739 georgian troops were supposed to conduct land and air attacks in the unrecognized republic of abkhazia to enter its capital sukhumi other documents that we have testify to the fact that the information which georgia obtained with the help of unmanned aerial aircraft was distributed among all commanders of georgian units

5466747 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5466748 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5466749 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5466750 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better

5466767 sa tingin ko maganda ang unang laban ni tshomlee dahil tinalo na niya yung i think tshomlee got himself a good first fight because he has beaten the australian

5466800 the committee for the liberation of iraq was the brainchild of the bush administration
5466801 it was inspired by a lobbying committee designed to sway us public and political opinion in favor of expanding the nato alliance
5466802 it is said that once the saddam regime has been overthrown the cli will act as a
5466803 sessions with opinion makers contacts for journalists and mass marketing when the time is ripe
5466804 considering the nations including the baltic states signed on the group at the expense of creating a schism in the european union the scheunemann initiative was unanimously regarded as a diplomatic triumph for washington and a coup de tat in brussels
5466805 with nato now set to enlarge from 19 members to take on seven east european nations including the three baltic states it is said that both the bush team and the committee for the liberation of iraq want the political mechanism of the atlantic alliance to replace the un security council in giving multilateral legitimacy to any major us action outside north america
5466806 this is because unlike the un security council where the french or russians might block american action natos political decisions do not require consensus the only natos military decisions require consensus
5466807 by joining our efforts senators mccain and lieberman highlight their commitment to ending the threat posed by saddam hussein and freeing the iraqi people
5466808 there is an insidious subtext in the debate over whether democracy can grow and flourish in iraq
5466809 even though a democratic iraq may be feasible goes the argument it is not desirable this view has adherents in the u s state department and among some foreign policy elites in middle eastern studies departments of major universities and in arab capitals for arab rulers the reason is obvious democracy in cairo damascus or riyadh would mean statues tumbling there

5466933 the problem is that the scenes have nothing to do with the movies general story line
5466934 the story continues without any reference to damage caused by the bomb and dr jones goes back to his adventures without showing any aftereffects
5466935 i understand that mr spielberg is not trying to justify atomic bombs apparently he has just used a nuclear bomb blast to depict indiana jones as a superhero who can survive anything even so i have to say it was too easy a choice
5466936 there are many children these days both in japan and the u s who are unaware of the nature of nuclear weapons what will they feel when they see the scenes
5466937 scrubbing dr jones with brushes to get rid of radiation what was that where is the science
5466938 damage caused by radiation is not a past problem that only involves the japanese
5466939 it is disappointing not to see that mr spielberg is aware of reality even though he is one of the worlds top film directors

5466944 i felt really comfortable with my batting for the first time in a while
5466945 another well played ballgame weve thrown the same type of game out again with little offense but great pitching we just couldnt generate offense when it was needed

5466972 defendant physicians contend that exposing them to liability for refusing to perform the iui medical procedure for plaintiff infringes upon their first amendment rights to free speech and free exercise of religion not so
5466973 this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women its a win for everyone because anyone could be the next target if doctors are allowed to pick and choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people
5466974 its taken nearly 10 years to get to this point but it was worth it
5466975 we had a tremendous candidate pool of over 46 people for the baseball head coaching position

5466977 id like to thank chancellor michael wartell and tommy bell for this great opportunity
5466978 the ipfw baseball program has had a lot of good people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into building this program and my goal is to see that vision through and compete for a conference championship year in and year out ultimately making ipfw baseball a regional presence

5466980 japan will not stand in the way of revising the guidelines at the upcoming nsg extraordinary plenary meeting
5466981 japan understands the significance of the peaceful use of nuclear energy and would like to consider whether the issue will create obstacles to the nonproliferation regime
5466982 compared with a decade ago taiwan japan relations are pretty good but theyre not yet close enough for there to be a big pool of qualified japan savvy experts from which president ma can cherry pick the top representative
5466983 also the position can be a hassle in terms of fairly low pay and frequently having to entertain guests and socialize
5466984 thats why nobody has been found yet who can do the job
5466985 the representative needs to have mutual trust with ma so thats why this has become a fairly difficult search

5466989 i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade and come to that conclusion not because im pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually they wrestle with these things in profound ways in consultation with their pastors or spouses or their doctors and their family members

5466993 can i just say choice and competition home schooling charter school vouchers all the choice competition i want home schooling works vouchers in our nations capitol works new york city is reforming new orleans now has over 30 charter schools in the city and guess what its all coming up what kind of opportunity is it if you send them to a failing school
5466994 i dont want to make money from the rich i want everybody to get rich i dont believe in class warfare or redistribution of the wealth but i can tell you for example there are small businessmen and women who are working 16 hours a day seven days a week that some people would classify as rich who some want to raise their taxes and their payroll taxes
5466995 dont think it was an accident that the presence of lithuania the presidents lithuania latvia estonia poland and ukraine flew to tbilisi to show their solidarity with the president of georgia because they all have something in common with georgia they lived under russian domination for a long period of time
5466996 by the way if you havent noticed we now have a pro america president of france which proves if you live long enough anything can happen in america
5466997 when i started saying you know were going to eliminate meals and gifts from corporate lobbyists i remember one of my colleagues whose name will be unmentioned who said well where do you expect us to eat mcdonalds and i thought well actually a lot of our constituents probably do eat at mcdonalds so that wouldnt be such a bad thing

5467032 the potency of the report is in demonstrating how big of an economic impact it has
5467033 and its setting the stage that we better pay attention because theres a lot at stake

5467056 our attacking play in the first half was good but as soon as we lost ryan giggs to a hamstring injury and michael carrick with an ankle we lost a bit of our experience in midfield
5467057 we ended up having to push patrice evra out to the left side of midfield and he is obviously not our best attacking player being a left back
5467058 in the context of the season we can come from behind theres no question about that
5467059 there are 37 games left and its not a disaster we lacked real width and penetration to make a make a difference to that game and that was a real problem
5467060 they call me blockhead in the changing room so sometimes it comes in handy
5467061 its a huge result for us and by going to the champions we knew it was going to be tough well take a lot of positives
5467062 demand is doubling every year and still we are only seeing those who are at the extreme end because we dont have the resources to see the others
5467063 obviously wed rather prevent obesity than treat it so we never have to see these people in a hospital but this is a start
5467064 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so theres no room for debate on this matter
5467065 money enhanced individualism but diminished communal motivations an effect that is still apparent in peoples responses today
5467066 the purpose is mainly to let people know that there is something going on here which is the dirty little secrets that pretty much most people dont know about
5467067 when we talk about tourism and people coming over to visit los angeles theyre not going to see the nasty parts
5467068 the juxtaposition of an oil refinery and a neighbourhood was the biggest eye opener for me
5467069 just knowing that their backyard was literally an oil refinery its inspiring and awing at the same time
5467070 if your average tourist or los angeles resident saw what we saw i think theyd have more of an appreciation and also of what organised community action can do
5467071 ac dc singer brian johnson promised that theyd tour in 2008 well he wasnt kidding soon theyll begin rehearsals in a secret location before hitting us arenas in late fall we heard this news at the sony hq on new yorks madison avenue before hearing all 15 tracks of the bands earthshaking new black ice recorded in vancouver in just eight weeks with brendan obrien on it brian wails about skies on fire blood in his eyes storms raging lightning flashes hard rain and pretty women angus young shreds throughout we dig his slide work on decibel and the rhythm cats malcom young cliff williams and phil rudd are solid as a rock the first single is rock n roll train she likes rock n roll will be a stripper anthem and war machine our favorite will tear you to pieces
5467072 instead i brought so much negative attention to my family
5467073 to grasp the hearts and imaginations of todays youth to lead them to know christ as their personal lord and savior to disciple them in christs commands and to forge them into passionate christians who are prepared to follow boldly the great commission while constantly equipping them to handle the spiritual battles to come
5467074 then the eleven disciples went to galilee to the mountain where jesus had told them to go
5467075 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you and surely i am with you always to the very end of the age
5467076 this was by no means an easy decision but teaching our students how to conjugate verbs in a way that would allow them to describe events that have already occurred is a luxury that we can no longer afford
5467077 with our current budget the past tense must unfortunately become a thing of the past
5467078 for some reading and writing about things not immediately taking place was almost as much a part of school as history class and social studies
5467079 that is until we were forced to drop history class and social studies a couple of months ago
5467080 much like art and music the past tense provides students with a unique and consistent outlet for self expression
5467081 without it i fear many of our students will lack a number of important creative skills like being able to describe anything that happened earlier in the day
5467082 our tax income should be spent preparing our children for the future not for what has already happened
5467083 its about time we stopped wasting everyones time with who did what or went where the past tense is by definition outdated
5467084 i cant even remember the last time i had to use it
5467085 no i do not want to go to the beach with maria and juan
5467086 at first i think the decision to drop the past tense from class is ridiculous and i feel very upset by it
5467087 theyve supported me through absolutely everything and im sure that it meant just as much to them as it did to me if not more
5467088 my dad was more emotional than my mum honestly hell hate me for saying that but he was absolutely blubbering like a baby i couldnt believe it
5467089 for the next four years every morning she can wake up and think i won two gold medals in the last olympics

5467094 item 2 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview factors influencing our results of operations
5467095 results for the three and six months ended june 30 2008 compared to results for the three and six months ended june 30 2007
5467096 despite the general economic headwinds and volatility in the markets edgewaters core operations improved its cash flow increased its cash position on the balance sheet and began to gain traction in emerging technical consulting offerings such as data services web analytics and internet commerce
5467097 at the beginning of the year we had predicted a shift in legacy technical assignments to a heavier mix of cpm engagements and new technical offerings and that is indeed happening
5467098 while some of our technical consulting offerings were soft we are beginning to see the sale of new offerings offset the pull back in long time customer engagements as they themselves shift gears in this difficult environment
5467099 we finished the quarter just shy of the lower end of our target utilization range and invested heavily in retooling our technical workforce in order to redeploy them in the emerging technical areas sales showed significant improvement by quarters end
5467100 the new technical offerings are gaining momentum but to acknowledge this rapidly shifting business environment the rate of the acceleration may not be enough to overcome the legacy softness as well as the traditional seasonality that we usually experience in q3 for those reasons we are guiding that service revenues will be flat to down in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2008
5467101 item 2 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview
5467102 we found that both physical and mental functions as well as mood and fatigue seemed to return to normal in about one year
5467103 nonetheless our finding also suggests that individuals who survive into the highest ages have a health profile that is similar in many aspects to that of individuals who are seven or eight years younger
5467104 even though individuals in this age range have an increased risk of disability for each additional year of life the frailest and most disabled members of the cohort are those who are most likely to die at any given age
5467105 most individuals can expect to experience physical decline before they die but the postponement of this individual decline makes it possible for us to live into a fourth age

5467109 the 2004 athens olympic champion was aware of an injury pre race but decided to run anyway
5467110 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5467111 it has been a problem for six or seven years
5467112 they will be disappointed but they will understand when somebody has an accident you cant help it
5467113 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5467114 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5467115 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5467116 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5467117 this cannot be done using but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5467118 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words

5467123 i love him more than if her were born to me naturally
5467124 i hope you dont take this the wrong way but i have been thinking about this after our meeting
5467125 his mother was adoptive mom as she raised loved and nurtured him in exchange he completed our family and loved us back it may seem as a small thing to you but we spent 20 years talking about you as his birthmother
5467126 so what you want to treat my uterus like a rental house
5467127 our family is increasingly concerned about what we can do if an earthquake or some other calamity strikes we live in an apartment will we be ok what kind of resources are there and what should we do in case of a disaster
5467128 but is it really true that in osaka they stand on the right and walk on the left like in london if so why
5467129 a 110 meter hurdles race without liu is such a pity
5467130 i really wanted to be just next to lius lane because hes such a big champion its a great pity i lost an occasion to race with him i hope he will come back soon
5467131 its bad luck not just for liu xiang or china but for everyone
5467132 we all wanted to see the race between him and dayron robles the world record holder from cuba
5467133 liu xiang is obviously very sad and i can understand his pain the pain is not in his leg where is the pain it is up here
5467134 after liu xiang entered the olympic village on the evening of the 16th of august he had an mri scan and the problem is in the end of his tendon
5467135 several years ago he had been checked in case his bone had a problem
5467136 liu xiang has a different heel bone than other people it is more protruding than other peoples and it has developed into a hard bump
5467137 three doctors were on the spot helping him to deal with the pain
5467138 but whatever measure was taken it was useless no matter if it was sprayed or iced it turned out to be useless because the injury is on the heel which takes the most force
5467139 given the asian physiology few expected that a chinese would ever be able to run under 13 seconds
5467140 i believe this is like a sort of miracle what has happened is incredible but i will keep on working very hard in the future and you can expect more miracles to happen
5467141 some of these things become self fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile
5467142 were certainly poised and ready when market conditions are appropriate
5467143 continues to exceed our regulatory capital requirements we continue to provide stability and liquidity to the housing market and we will continue to play a key role as the market recovers from this cycle
5467144 somehow we have to understand we can only keep him alive if the love we felt for him and the love he felt for us is somehow manifest in our lives
5467145 make a list of what you were grateful for in bill gwatneys life
5467146 he was a better golfer than i was i am not grateful for that
5467147 but he seemed to genuinely like it if i hit a good shot which is a sign of grace
5467148 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5467149 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5467150 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5467151 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5467152 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5467153 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5467154 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5467155 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that
5467156 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that
5467157 on the other hand are the people of this country the business community and there too i dont see any new initiatives
5467158 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5467159 whatever one might say it may be difficult for the politicians to give him the indemnity
5467160 there were certain elements who were politicking with the economy and terrorism
5467161 i heard what i thought sounded like thunder and the next thing i knew my front door was being banged on
5467162 there were 12 or 15 young people standing there crying and with blood running down them
5467163 they said there had been an accident they couldnt speak english
5467164 i rang 999 and went outside i was astonished to see a double decker bus it had dropped through my neighbours garden it must have fallen about 15 feet and had rolled over
5467165 from what i could see a coach had crashed at the hill and ploughed through a neighbours garden
5467166 it ploughed through two cars parked in a driveway one of them was bouncing down the road the other must have flown along with the coach
5467167 it must have dropped about twenty feet it was on a slope its diagonal not headfirst
5467168 there were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus the majority of the people were walking wounded probably half a dozen serious injuries
5467169 people tell me all the time that i am wonderful
5467170 but im a client teams of lawyers and surveyors earn money from me but do they like me
5467171 i was scared that i had lost the ability to talk to people about anything except business
5467172 my immediate reaction when i was asked to take part was that i didnt want to be seen giving away money on tv but it did bring to my attention some social issues
5467173 everyone i met there seems to have been to prison have stab wounds or be a reformed drug addict
5467174 in fact i was only barmitzvahed at the age of 28 a 250 quickie at the wailing wall in order to marry maxine
5467175 the other kids had new football boots and tennis rackets and i didnt when you are insecure you try to fill the void i discovered a knack for trade that became my way to fill the void it takes a while to realise that it doesnt
5467176 i did everything very young i was the youngest chief executive of a public company burford aged 23 soon after i became chief executive of two public companies at once
5467177 i found i had a fear of disability when i see someone in a wheelchair at an airport i am a metaphorical road crosser afterwards i thought what a twit i am for being afraid of talking to a kid with downs syndrome i had the best evening of my life with those kids
5467178 i also had an insight into poverty i would always condemn a drug pusher but what would i do if i was having to live on an 8 50 a day jobseekers allowance there is always an alternative but it is very remote if you cant afford the bus fare to mcdonalds to ask for a job
5467179 the workforce is unskilled theres no work ethic and it wouldnt be safe the government has to be the catalyst for introducing private enterprise that doesnt mean i want to pay higher taxes i dont want average inefficient people spending my money
5467180 maybe politicians were once altruistic but now they are egocentric people who would mostly do very badly in the real world

5467224 poenget mitt er at l gnene om gulag demoniserer sovjet og stalin demonisering fungerer fordummende uansett hvem den rammer videre mener jeg at den spesifikke demoniseringen av sovjet og stalin i stor grad er antikommunistisk motivert og at den fors ker avvise de enorme konomiske og sosiale fremskrittene i sovjet fra 1922 til 1940 samt etter krigen

5467253 he hasnt made any decisions and hasnt had a chance to speak with mr campbell yet but this is a call for post partisanship that mayor bloomberg hopes the major parties will hear
5467254 if it is an issue that a candidate is put forth we assume that the internal communications have happened but if we were to receive a letter from mayor bloomberg that he doesnt want his name on the ballot we would have to look into the matter to see why the nominee for a party doesnt want to be that nominee it is a free country and if chooses to not have his name on the ballot he has every right to do so

5467265 we see little hope for woolworths to deliver in its current incarnation it needs to break out of depending on christmas for its sales and get customers through the door all year round if you look at poundland and home amp bargains they are doing this quite successfully

5467294 um filme sobre amigos e n o sobre a bossa nova
5467295 the best films that we see and present at the festival are films where the filmmakers achieve the impossible because no one ever told them that what they were attempting was impossible
5467296 the combined budgets of all the films that we are showing is probably less than the shoe budget of sex and the city but looking at the films you would never know how little money the directors had to spend
5467297 every year we see films telling new stories or telling old stories in new ways
5467298 i should have killed you when i first met you
5467299 in spite of its being grammatically and logically obtuse overly simplistic and naive and hyperbolic to a fault it was very enlightening and entertaining reading it was comparable to watching professional wrestling on tv was it supposed to be serious
5467300 the bus was coming down a steep hill towards the bridge at the bottom and from what i can see at the scene that bus has not managed to go round the bend and has careered through a wall and down a drop into a garden
5467301 i would call it the most valuable piece of real estate in the world right now
5467302 chinese consumers are getting more money now and in their leisure time they will spend a lot on culture and sports
5467303 it would be a really significant thing that a brand could say about their commitment to china
5467304 we will choose a company that has a very good reputation in china
5467305 we are delighted that the launch of the film coincides with the launch of such a significant new model for ford of europe
5467306 the leading provider of entertainment that compels and inspires social change
5467307 my one concern before agreeing to accept their money and admittedly that came down to a decision on how to finance the movie was that they would try to put the message first i said look this has to be a character movie and not an issue film audiences want to see a good story and they dont want to be taught something
5467308 they couldnt invest money but they allowed us to take some pieces out of the museum to use in the film and shoot in the museum at a reduced rate
5467309 you know if i hang out with you and someone finds out i will go to jail i will be called a pedophile
5467310 if you dont know how to do something and you try rest less with link to this week i file my first major complaint with rails

5467312 how little the residents knew about the coming health care battle being waged in their name
5467313 it will not only be more interesting but it will help people evaluate the ad messages the special interest spiels the propaganda and the demagoguery that will surely come
5467314 the hybrid system has the torque delivery of a diesel
5467315 its always there for you thats how it feels it pulls like a mule the other part of it is you dont get the cadenced shifts like a diesel when climbing hills its glass smooth the transmission always finds the optimal ratio for you without hunting
5467316 with the electronically variable transmission you have the equivalent of tow haul mode
5467317 it gives you optimal gearing all the time grade braking is the same deal the evt gives you the benefit of the automatic braking that you need we cadence the hybrid transmission so if you tap the brake it behaves just like tow haul mode
5467318 perhaps the largest change happening in the interaction between the physical and computing worlds
5467319 if you take it as an order of magnitude challenge history says we can get half of that from better algorithms and half of that from better systems
5467320 costs for labor materials and supplies and other operating expenses continue to rise

5467325 the latter group women who did not take maternity leave is significantly more likely to have been promoted by june 30 2007
5467326 the figures may also be distorted by the possibility that women having children are at a relatively more senior classification already and simply have less scope for promotion
5467327 having a child brings a great opportunity cost to their career
5467328 i think it is certainly concerning that women are being discriminated against because of their family situation
5467329 shhh be vewwwy vewwwy quiet im hunting wabbits in de web

5467332 studio chiefs do not want radcliffes saucy grown up image to be associated with his innocent boy wizard alter ego
5467333 learn three chords on the guitar and write a tune instead of ruining everyone elses

5467335 an entire generation of developing world youth would be removed from the cockpit of religious fundamentalism presuming they dont make the hideous mistake of moving to the american bible belt and would be exposed to the irresistible distractions of sex drugs and rocknroll they would be won over forever to the light side of the force the enlightenment liberalism atheism sexual permissiveness punk rock disco dancing ice cream real ale books puppy dogs and all that good stuff
5467336 in this market unless i have a reason to think a movie like this is going to be a slam dunk im not going to take a flyer on it even with heath ledger

5467342 if too human does what we expect it will then it can change the world for st catharines and niagara
5467343 ive said this before i want to see a campus here in niagara dedicated to interactive information technology
5467344 i am not somebody who promotes same sex marriage but i do believe in civil unions i do believe that we should not that for gay partners to want to visit each other in a hospital for the state to say you know what thats all right i dont think in any way inhibits my core beliefs about what marriage are
5467345 so for me the goal right now should be and this is where i think we can find common ground and by the way ive now inserted this into the democratic party platform is how do we reduce the number of abortions
5467346 first one i think would be general david petraeus one of the great military leaders in american history who took us from defeat to victory in iraq one of the great leaders john lewis was at the edmund pettis bridge meg whitman meg whitman the ceo of ebay
5467347 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
5467348 our joint terrorism task force is involved in this simply because the victim here is from another country and it just kind of makes sense that our terrorism guys would take a look a look at this
5467349 i dont see how anybody could do anything but look into the possibility that this is a potential terrorist attack
5467350 the very first thought that came to my mind was murder or somebody whos got to kill an awful lot of rodents because years ago cyanide used to be used to kill rats and roaches
5467351 a tablespoon would be enough to kill you less actually
5467352 it was used in concentration camps in world war ii and by saddam hussein against the kurds in the 1990s
5467353 and put it in a little capsule it is in fact used as a suicide pill just like you see in the movies
5467354 yeah stan but how many dog years old are you
5467355 i guess if youre using the new calculation id be about 208
5467356 so then the fish has lived since four years before you were even here hes been moved between three houses when you moved
5467357 im just saying its jarring to a fish when his environment changes
5467358 look its just an old fish thats all im saying it could be a lucky one
5467359 the livingroom couch or under the dining room table it depends
5467360 lets just consider that mr buttonfin is being replaced each night by a new fish you probably dont take enough care of the fish to notice
5467361 i actually do its weird i dont do the dishes much or keep too clean but buttonfins tank is sacred to me i always take care of him
5467362 hi stan this is janice we spoke on craigs list a few weeks ago you told me to call you and i was wondering if you were available tonight or if youre not maybe we could plan for another night
5467363 slow down yeah i mean sure you live in the neighborhood right um theres a nice art pizza place maybe we could go there if you like pizza and stuff
5467364 hey is that chris he doesnt believe me that the fish is really old tell him he owes me money
5467365 sorry that was my buddy hes leaving should we meet at 7ish
5467366 im trying to do a vegetarian diet so lets not have too much meat on the pizza

5467371 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5467372 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
5467373 its not going to change its not a family show were still going to be on after 9pm torchwoods a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
5467374 gt dropped out to be in the doubtless crappy law and order uk but thats just me now what do you think
5467375 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london

5467377 the duo take on the evil palindrome a super villain who kidnaps wendy and transports her to a parallel universe
5467378 they were the closest to us before the war and now they are the most frightening enemy
5467379 it feels like your own brother has cut off your head
5467380 after what happened it should be clear that they should have self determination
5467381 the reality is that for 15 years at least south ossetia and abkhazia have been independent in fact
5467382 its not true the goal of russia is peace in the caucasus
5467383 we have to get involved if were going to be true to the gospel of christ and make a difference in the world in which were living
5467384 a spirit that was begun in aparecida the spirit of mission of discipleship
5467385 the challenge for mission for latin america is to move beyond the boundaries of latin america to go out
5467386 realizing that we are all missionaries even in our own parishes we have to become those who listen learn
5467387 must proclaim the good news of the kingdom in faithfulness and strength especially because there are many who oppose it out of ambition for power love of wealth or desire for pleasure
5467388 be willing to renounce all they have had until now to carry out the mission of propagating the faith both within and beyond the borders of the country
5467389 do not know the full manifestation of the love of god
5467390 to the growing multitude of those who do not know christ
5467391 as evangelizers we are concerned about so many men and women who for various reasons have become strangers to the faith or to religious meaning
5467392 challenge of seeing how this experience of interchange can help us become one church in america
5467393 can we make a difference with our government in the sense of the way we do politics or with our economic community in the way we do business in latin america so that people will not have to leave to come and find work in our country
5467394 we are saying we are one america we are one family we are one church

5467402 i have received your distressing letter of our friends of the congress assembly party in sindh have acted in a manner which has brought discredit to the organization and to themselves the hindu panchayat of sukkur has it seems succeeded in coercing them to a line of action which they would not have taken if they had the choice or the requisite courage to stand by the principles of the congress they talk of wider interest of the country in relation to their action while they forget that they are not serving the local much less the wider interest

5467541 how the vacuum is handled by the civilian government how much control they can exercise on the radical elements remains to be seen
5467542 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5467543 india will continue to have an amicable relation with pakistan in the days to come
5467544 after four good years in which india had high hopes for the peace process in the last four months the opposite has happened
5467545 musharraf was seen by india as decisive and ready to engage compared with the chaos and division of the last few months
5467546 the isi enjoyed greater autonomy since musharrafs wings were clipped
5467547 once he is removed from the scene isi may have even greater autonomy
5467548 whether he is impeached or not is not important from the indian point of view
5467549 but it leaves a big vacuum and we are deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on pakistan afghan border but clearly our side of the border too

5467591 very rare case reports of pancreatitis with complications or with a fatal outcome
5467592 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5467593 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5467594 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5467595 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5467596 this cannot be done using visual memory but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5467597 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words
5467598 in our recent work we have demonstrated that piraha speakers achieve high accuracy on matching tasks despite having no count words whatsoever not even a word for one

5467609 rpv city council seems to think the ponte vista traffic mitigation measures on western avenue do not require rpvs cooperation regardless of the fact most of western avenue between pv drive north and summerland lie within rpv city boundaries i believe i read in the ladot informational material that rpvs cooperation is required i would really appreciate clear facts in this regard are traffic mitigation measures outside rpv jurisdiction entirely or does their position and that of their residents have zero value thank you for your time
5467610 i apologize for the delayed response but i needed to speak with someone from our transportation department regarding this issue to put this in the simplest terms any mitigation measures that occur within rpv boundaries need to be approved by rpv hope this helps

5467628 so youll have to look elsewhere for a patsy because no way am i letting you accuse them of something we both know they didnt do
5467629 theyre mine by right i rescued them from dyfynnogs castle
5467630 that gives me the right to take them into custody youre not the only one with witchy connections missy so dont give me any shit that just because you rescued their furry asses you can protect them
5467631 they need to be taken before the witches council and destroyed for their actions
5467632 theyre not going anywhere until theres rock hard proof that they ate willie
5467633 i have one of willies shoes with his blood on it and tufts of fur plus i have this
5467634 thats not saying its his blood or their fur i have the right to investigate the matter
5467635 you know i have the right to invoke protection for them until the truth is discovered
5467636 two weeks and be grateful for it all youre going to find out is that your things ate willie and make sure they dont go anywhere
5467637 oh no you are so not going to be the cause of more banishment time for me

5467640 i understand there was room for improvement and there still might be i work for screaming death monkey and spotnitz the terrific frank spotnitz told us this week that the team have already spoken about the next x files film its likely the next release will go direct to dvd but theyre working on the assumption theyll have a similar budget
5467641 ms gold roams at ease through the most difficult and recondite topics like an indiana jones of the world of letters
5467642 with blu ray you can actually download material onto the dvd from the internet
5467643 so i think theyre putting the video game and stuff on the internet
5467644 its like the sh ttiest video game youve ever seen but its a video game and you can download it
5467645 its like donkey kong kind of in 1983 it wouldve been amazing but its a game so you can kill some time at work
5467646 we shot a lot of actors we know playing weird characters and coming and buying weed off of saul in the apartment guys like martin starr and justin long and a bunch of actors whoever was around craig robinson and people in the movie
5467647 we got every actor we know to come in and do kind of little item nine experiments as we called them i dont know if any of it is funny it could all suck i havent seen any of it
5467648 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of
5467649 the poultry industry is such a valuable commodity in south carolina
5467650 it is wonderful to know that i am being recognized for doing an excellent job in providing a high quality environment for poultry in our area
5467651 we maintain our farm so that our neighbors will feel that their community is safe environmentally
5467652 i take great pride in knowing that the most environmentally safe practices are being used to maintain land that is safe and profitable for generations to come farmland is constantly changing and we are losing valuable farms to commercial and residential properties daily
5467653 los clientes al principio sintieron curiosidad y luego alguien avis a las autoridades costeras
5467654 no voy a hacer comentarios espec ficos sobre qu unidades o equipamiento ruso est n en el rea en este momento
5467655 pero d jenme ser claro si ingres despu s del 6 de agosto debe salir eso ser a de acuerdo al compromiso de los rusos con la retirada
5467656 cualquier cosa como esa o cualquier otro equipamiento militar que haya ingresado ser a una violaci n a este cese del fuego y deber a ser retirado inmediatamente
5467657 continuaremos monitoreando de cerca las acciones rusas en georgia para una confirmaci n de la retirada esto es algo que deber a lograrse sin demora
5467658 sigue el gobierno prefectos de la autonom a tambi n la oposici n que tenemos en el congreso lo que resta por determinar es si el gobierno va a cambiar de actitud si va a entender que el proyecto de constituci n que intenta imponer no es un proyecto nacional
5467659 est manchado de sangre con tres muertos y centenares de heridos en sucre dinamit el tribunal constitucional golpe a la oposici n y provoc la reacci n de las regiones donde hab a ganado la autonom a que fue birlada santa cruz beni pando y tarija
5467660 entienda de una vez que no va a poder hacer lo que hizo hugo ch vez en venezuela que el primer a o cambi su constituci n y ah sigue en el poder
5467661 no contentos con tomar el poder por las urnas lo que buscan es perpetuarse en el poder a trav s de un cambio constitucional donde centralizan recursos aniquilan constituciones pulverizan la econom a y buscan quedarse en la administraci n gubernamental mucho tiempo
5467662 ojal que el gobierno se divorcie de ch vez y se case con bolivia eso es lo que todos esperamos
5467663 imponer una constituci n totalitaria hegem nica autoritaria siguiendo la receta de hugo ch vez
5467664 para m significa un gran compromiso y un gran honor poder estar ese d a tan cerca de un m sico tan talentoso como juanes
5467665 sigo trabajando en la promoci n de mi disco esto me absorbe tiempo porque es una producci n independiente y me involucro en todos los detalles pero lo hago con mucho cari o
5467666 para m componer se ha vuelto como respirar cuando llego cansada a los hoteles por las noches mientras estoy de gira saco mi guitarra y me pongo a crear esto es el resultado del destino porque nunca me hab a planteado escribir y menos para otros
5467667 hay dos decretos en espec fico que van violar lo que significa los recursos que deben bajar a las alcald as y gobernaciones se crea un fondo adicional en el cual los dividendos de petr leos de venezuela pdvsa van a un fondo especial y el 20 de esos recursos no van a bajar a las alcald as
5467668 con qu vamos a gobernar en las alcald as y gobernaciones debe ser fundamental para aquellos que aspiran ocupar a esos cargos luchar por los recursos para que puedan ejecutar buenas obras
5467669 quisi ramos ver tambi n qu dicen los candidatos chavistas que no est n defendiendo los recursos de las regiones sino que tambi n no cuestionan el nombramiento de autoridades nicas por encima de gobernadores y alcaldes con competencia son de gobernadores y alcaldes
5467670 lo que estamos haciendo es un mecanismo pac fico de protesta
5467671 i think policemen have done their best as its not easy to distinguish the situation in which tickets are actually transferred in a fair way and the situation in which the tickets are scalped for high profits
5467672 of course as a standard practice there are some emergency tickets about two percent of the total and scattered all over the venues for dealing with emergencies such as the certain part of a venue has to be blocked such kind of tickets must be kept and we do not have any other tickets
5467673 that case is currently through legal process i believe the case for injunction procedures will be due sometime at the end of this week
5467674 there is nobody wanting to see this kind of business practice it hurt those who want to come and join the games and we were together working as hard as possible to stamp out these practices
5467675 sure its got the built in coolness of don cheadle guy pearce amp jeff daniels but check out who is credited with the story for this flick steve martin
5467676 he is in the top tier of athletics and now hes going to get his tryout as a personality
5467677 and tiger woods sure passed but mark spitz didnt and there are plenty of people who they try to develop the whole persona around and two years later its gone
5467678 what is the value of eight golds in beijing before a prime time audience in the u s
5467679 id say 100 million over the course of his lifetime
5467680 one gold medal is amazing two is well incredible three practically unbelievable but eight eight gold medals thats thats well well were going to need some new adjectives for whatever that is congratulations michael
5467681 we continue to evaluate post beijing activities that will allow us to reinforce our relationship with michael
5467682 its huge its the opportunity that no startup generally gets
5467683 with opportunity obviously theres a lot of responsibility for us to take advantage of it properly and do it in a way that not only benefits the company but also benefits michael
5467684 we are currently evaluating opportunities to build upon this excitement however a final determination about our future plans has not yet been made
5467685 is he funny is he warm is he interesting does he say things that make you want to listen more or is he the great athlete who is pleased to be here and hes done its going to be interesting
5467686 some of these things become self fulfilling prophecies because market confidence is so fragile
5467687 were certainly poised and ready when market conditions are appropriate
5467688 continues to exceed our regulatory capital requirements we continue to provide stability and liquidity to the housing market and we will continue to play a key role as the market recovers from this cycle

5467705 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5467706 we believe this favorable trend could start to be reflected in reduced auto insurance rates
5467707 regulators could force auto insurers to withdraw price increases due to this trend
5467708 i sort of needed this album to right my sanity beautiful pastoral equal parts kings of convenience mojave 3 and belle and sebastian
5467709 an articulate collection of songs sure to warm your soul with pleasant melodies and story like lyrics an acoustic dream with the kind of tunes thatll lift your spirits during a rainy day it is one of those rare debuts that carry a lot of clout this well orchestrated album comes off gentle and well meaning without being pretentious or overbearing in the way that its so simple and true indie pop has never sounded so good
5467710 ask me why and i have no answer cinemas just a part of me
5467711 id like to take breaks and then get back to acting
5467712 ive put on a couple on kilos my children keep asking me to tone up
5467713 urban areas tend to have higher insurance rates than their country cousins because property values and costs associated with rebuilding are usually higher washington is nothing but city and labor and business costs for repair add to pricing throw into the mix insurers perception that the district is at risk for terrorism and its easy to understand the 963 per year
5467714 i certainly agree that we should promote a more plant based diet but not that meat eating in moderation is inconsistent with sustainable living in the long term
5467715 enviro groups will never likely use these arguments because they are shared by so few they are so far out of the mainstream most people would hear the arguments above and think we were crazy
5467716 i dont think enviro groups are afraid to offend mainstream members i think the smart ones do not want to offend people culturally the environmental movement is so white and being anti oppressive and more diverse needs to be a priority having vegetarianism be the exclusive norm only builds more walls between us and communities where food is an important cultural resource and sense of identity and is not vegetarian
5467717 i think the cultural aspects of eating meat need to be considered the majority of the worlds cultures include some meat in their diets how and how much of it i personally believe is a better way to address the animal for food issue than no animals for food discussions around whether humans are natural omnivores versus vegans i also think should be valued
5467718 local meat is best corporate animal agriculture is where the problems really come in
5467719 to me its the gap between environmental justice and animal rights when people are dying because of the coal death march its hard to worry about sad cows at the same time i realize that the justice issue overlaps with the humans and animals involved i just dont have enough time for it all
5467720 a lack of initiative of either movement to put time and energy into developing common programs that would build closer relationships
5467721 establishing preconditions that limit discussion and space for finding common ground like
5467722 underlying value systems are not the same for many environmentalists their value system is rooted in human rights and posterity this puts them far more inline with the value systems of the social justice and human rights movements than a movement that puts animal rights above humans lots of animal testing is being done in direct efforts to improve human welfare issues like this demand pragmatism and balance not fundamentalism
5467723 the fact that we can all help do our part in reducing green house gas emissions simply by changing how we eat eating meat 1 time a week would be a great start
5467724 the most opportunities for collaboration exist when we focus on how animals are treated welfare we should focus on providing the most humane treatment of all animals as possible wild animals as well as those domesticated for food
5467725 the ar and env movements have plenty of overlap in membership and infrastructure as it is efforts at cross movement collaboration should meld env and social justice movements as much as possible if we want to win and ar fundamentalism is offensive to many sj and hr groups who are working against unbelievable human suffering that is happening now on a massive scale
5467726 extremism on any side tends to paint all soldiers with the same unfortunate color
5467727 how can i be more collaborative with the environmental movement
5467728 how can i get the environmental movement to promote veganism
5467729 if they have it they can manage it make more money with it understand whats going on with it
5467730 we know that if other peoples freedom is threatened then its not long before our freedom is threatened
5467731 we are here to say that we are not afraid
5467732 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
5467733 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the aggressor has been punished and has suffered very considerable losses
5467734 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
5467735 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
5467736 if we have received the order to cease fire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance
5467737 its like the old soviet days they were making an example of us for ukraine and others to see
5467738 what we need is to get out of a crisis i just want to push people to dialogue
5467739 tskhinvali doesnt exist its like stalingrad was after the war
5467740 schools hospital houses all infrastructure is ruined theres no water no electricity we will rebuild it
5467741 well open tomorrow because we expect the weather will be nice
5467742 this isnt a hurricane if the media wasnt down here hyping this up this would be a non event
5467743 after seeing what happened in new orleans and that area i think early evacuation of visitors is important for safety especially in the keys where we only have one road out lives are more important than revenue
5467744 this isnt the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs
5467745 in a letter today to the free gaza movement the israeli ministry of foreign affairs acknowledged that the group of international human rights activists attempting to break the siege of gaza were
5467746 since the foreign ministers office responded to our invitation to join us and said that we have good intentions we now fully expect to reach gaza
5467747 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5467748 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5467749 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5467750 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5467751 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5467752 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5467753 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5467754 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5467755 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5467756 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5467757 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

5467785 unlike scientology which is based on empirically verifiable scientific tenets fantanologys central principles are essentially fairy tales with no connection to reality
5467786 in short fantanology offers its followers a mythical belief system free from the cumbersome scientific method to which scientology is hidebound
5467787 my wife chooses to follow the teachings of the gilmore girls of course we are still beginners some advanced level fantanologists have total knowledge of every lifetime they have ever lived for the last 80 trillion years
5467788 scientology is rooted in strict scientific principles such as the measurement of engrams in the brain by the e meter
5467789 scientology uses strictly scientific methodologies to undo the damage done 75 million years ago by the galactic confederations evil warlord xenu we offer our preclear followers procedures to erase overts in the reactive mind conversely fantanology is essentially just a bunch of make believe nonsense

5467792 the person himself not his body or his name the physical universe his mind or anything else that which is aware of being aware the identity which is the individual the thetan is most familiar to one and all as
5467793 scientology can only offer data such as how an operating thetan can control matter energy space and time with pure thought alone
5467794 but truly spiritual people dont care about data especially those seeking an escape from very real physical mental or emotional problems
5467795 as a fantanologist i live in a world of pretend its liberating man
5467796 in recruiting new members fantanology preys on the gullible with fanciful stories and simple minded solutions

5467807 thats one thing that we can walk away being happy about
5467808 we felt like we had a car capable of winning
5467809 we chased the track a little bit i think everybody did we didnt chase it fast enough the track continued to get looser and looser and we didnt keep up with it quite as fast as we needed to
5467810 its frustrating you want to win one of these races so bad and you think you have an opportunity to and you dont capitalize on it im really proud of the red bull toyota team we did a good job all day it was a great points day we just have to go get them next week
5467811 it was either as good as or maybe even better than it was the first time we raced here and won that one at the beginning devon and i had a pretty good show that was fun i had a good time with that we raced door to door which im sure was a cool view for the fans to watch us put some doughnuts on the doors like that once he slipped up i knew that was my chance to get away
5467812 he wouldnt let me have the win on the outside once he started pulling away the 70 bergh came up usually we bump a couple times but it was a good clean pass this time i enjoyed racing with him this time he just had a faster car and pulled it off
5467813 it feels great i worked hard to get to second tonight i was on his bumper the whole race and once my spotter told me there were five laps to go i decided i had to go and make my move and i did
5467814 i was definitely happy with fourth because i think i raced as hard as i could
5467815 i drove the best i could to get third or second but the lapped cars held me up a couple of times i was a little bit frustrated when i got out of the truck because i wanted to get into the top three if it wasnt for the lapped traffic i think i couldve raced with those guys some more and finished even better i was a little disappointed but i really was happy with the good finish
5467816 its great because everyones been really nice to me i raced with a lot of the people in this series in bandoleros so i like being able to race with them in these cars too these cars are a lot more fun because they have a sway bar theyre bigger they have more power and theyre almost out of control
5467817 day one when we went out to hickory the very first race we knew theyd have some building to do but all the rookies have really picked it up and built themselves up to be pretty good out here theyre all good drivers and theyve got good teams behind them theyre learning fast
5467818 with these pro challenge cars once you get adapted to them you can really take off all those rookies are really coming on and i think there are a couple of them that youll really have to watch out for come the playoff races
5467819 what we would be looking to do with any form of original content is the added component that zune could provide that itunes or any competing service couldnt

5467830 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5467831 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5467832 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5467833 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5467834 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5467835 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5467836 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5467837 theres a lot of issues weve got to deal with on the personnel side
5467838 we can turn this around galaxy owner aeg realizes its not going to happen overnight
5467839 i told the team the team is not about landon donovan or david beckham
5467840 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5467841 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5467842 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5467843 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5467844 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5467845 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5467846 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5467847 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5467848 well see if they can turn their attention to governance and get a handle on their problems
5467849 they have been using the musharraf thing as an excuse for non governance
5467850 this is really the moment of truth for pakistan if this fails it is unclear what will happen
5467851 it will take the new government a full year to work things out on counterterrorism a year to make the mistakes they have to make it is a huge experiment
5467852 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing
5467853 pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5467854 were confident that we will maintain a good relationship with the government of pakistan
5467855 had a good meeting with the prime minister a couple of weeks ago in washington the pakistanis realize that the threat of terrorism the threat of extremism is a threat to them as well as the rest of the world
5467856 he hasnt effectively been leading pakistan for the last six months
5467857 youre truly not going to see any great changes in pakistan with musharrafs resignation with the exception you will start to see greater political infighting among the coalition partners
5467858 you could count on him to make tough decisions even though you could never count on him to completely follow through
5467859 it will probably be much harder to get decisive action as we did with musharraf the good news is that the democracy process is moving forward and it may be possible to create a more durable political framework
5467860 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5467861 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5467862 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5467863 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5467864 the military government in thailand have already tried to seize all of his assets once
5467865 i can imagine more stable financial backgrounds that he could have come from
5467866 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5467867 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5467868 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5467869 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5467870 well i guess picking up some kwanzaa cards for my african american friends is out of the question

5467906 our season started off almost exactly how we wanted it to
5467907 we struggled during one of our games this weekend but we are still learning from each other
5467908 it was a tight game that i think we could have won
5467909 things just seemed to be leaning their way and not ours
5467910 it didnt happen for us but we shouldnt have been that close

5468029 the device did not operate in terms of transmitting a signal because it found that particular channel was occupied
5468030 there would be zero chance of causing any interference to the signals because in that situation there certainly would not be a transmission of the signal in the first place

5468078 van grootaandeelhouders genieten we meer vertrouwen als we daar uitleggen we gaan het als volgt doen dan begrijpen we elkaar kleine aandeelhouders begrijpen het jargon niet altijd en denken vooral ai ik krijg dit jaar geen dividend en de koers is omlaag dus moeten we het extra uitleggen
5468079 ik ben zeer tevreden over deze premiere avond waarvan er nog meer zullen volgen ik denk dat hiermee een eerste stap is gezet naar het herwinnen van het vertrouwen dat ongetwijfeld hier en daar geschaad is
5468080 de avond verliep vrij goed beter dan we hadden verwacht maar veel hadden we al gehoord
5468081 het is een goede eerste stap maar het moet leiden tot een moment van verantwoording 2009 is daarvoor te laat we hebben nog andere vragen

5468090 the deals are possible to be made but one misconception is that this is a way to make some easy money and thats just not the case
5468091 one of the great things about the lis pendens stage is it looks exactly like a normal sale
5468092 you should work with a broker youd be able to go look at the property
5468093 the seller is able to sell the home without damaging their credit report
5468094 you as a buyer you receive the home that you want probably at a discounted price and the bank wins too because they dont have to go through the costly painful process of foreclosure
5468095 its not for the feint of heart because many times when you bid you have to be able to put up cash money and you dont have that opportunity to inspect the house
5468096 you also may purchase a property with someone living in the property and then if you purchase that property you are now the owner and you have a tenant and you have to go through the eviction process
5468097 the bank then goes out and gets a broker to represent that property so then youre really doing a transaction a normal transaction with a broker

5468170 concerned about a setback in what may be the start of a housing industry recovery they are lobbying to reverse a provision of the legislation that would prevent first time buyers from obtaining down payment assistance from sellers including the banks that own foreclosed properties
5468171 rich cosner president of nine prudential california realty offices in southern california said the potential loss of these down payment assistance programs should be enough to push some prospective home buyers off the fence
5468172 if someone is thinking about buying a first house it would behoove them to get into escrow and get it closed now he said
5468173 the tv ad looked so attractive no down payment and low fixed rates the commercial promised doug cron and ernie meeker called got a 280 000 loan and moved into their first house three years ago but within a few months the couples dream in cathedral city turned into a nightmare we figured like the property we owned before that the property would go up in value meeker said
5468174 then the five year fixed rate the couple thought they had received began to adjust as home values began to crash
5468175 the truth is real estate goes up and down said assemblywoman bonnie garcia cathedral city who has tried to address the housing crisis with a lending bill that would have eliminated pre payment penalties that discourage refinancing on nontraditional loans
5468176 if your pocketbook doesnt go up that fast or life happens to you youre derailed she said
5468177 within three months of the ink drying the couples 720 mortgage started creeping up first by about 50 a month then another 50 and another when their mortgage payment jumped to more than 2 200 a month they stopped making payments
5468178 i wasnt reading stuff acknowledged meeker who at the time of the contract signing was on dialysis because of kidney failure
5468179 and cron is legally blind and could not read the contract they trusted the real estate agent who earned top commission in the deal by brokering a higher loan and interest rate documents show
5468180 about a year after they moved in the couple realized their 720 mortgage was in actuality a minimum payment that did not cover the mounting interest let alone the principal they now regret signing the contract saying they felt pressured to do so when the loan officer told them they would lose their 75 000 down payment
5468181 in june the couple sidestepped formal foreclosure proceedings to salvage their credit by signing the home back over to the bank
5468182 we lost our lifes savings in that place cron said
5468183 whos to say whos right and whos wrong said ray henderson a former loan officer with a now defunct mortgage brokerage and now executive vp of national real estate solutions in palm springs which sells homes headed into foreclosure

5468188 simi valley could become the home of ventura countys largest habitat for humanity housing project the nonprofit organization has been working with the affordable housing subcommittee of simi valley with the hopes of purchasing property on patricia avenue to build 10 town homes
5468189 rob bruce deputy director of housing and special projects for the city of simi valley noted the citys housing slump has made it easier for nonprofits to buy land
5468190 no new projects are really selling right now prices are still falling with the economy bruce said
5468191 merced is number two in the nation when it comes to foreclosure filings and the countys unemployment rate is the highest in valley only cape coral fort myers florida has it worse giving merced the dubious distinction of second in the nation
5468192 the ranking came as a shock to ellie wooten she said she knew things were bad but she didnt realize her community was among the worst in the nation i just hate to see that said wooten
5468193 wooten now finds herself wearing two hats one as the citys mayor the other as a realtor she and her fellow realtors say its common for each of them to see 5 10 new foreclosure listings a week white boards in several offices show dozens of reos or real estate owned listings
5468194 the foreclosure issue in merced is now capturing the attention of national media wooten was interviewed by a new york times reporter last week and drove him around town to show him the reality of the problem this is the real story its not a fairytale its not pleasant its not funny its serious and people are being hurt said wooten

5468198 the whole delta economy is based around boating said jamie bolt harbormaster of bethel harbor marina as gas prices soared business at marinas bait and tackle shops boat dealerships restaurants and repair shops plummeted
5468199 bolt and others point out that gas prices arent the only problem the housing market crisis has combined with fuel costs to deal a one two punch to delta businesses
5468200 for example construction on delta coves planned as bethel islands largest and most upscale residential development with 494 single family homes and 66 condominiums halted in mid july because of east countys troubled housing market irvine based developer suncal companies put the project on hold when demand for new homes plunged according to company spokesman joe aguirre

5468209 theres no question that its the purchase of the foreclosures that are driving local sales
5468210 in north san diego county coastal zip codes where foreclosures and defaults have been relatively few the overall median price on a resale home slid the most in july of any of the five subregions down 31 1 percent from 697 000 in july 2007 to 480 000 last month

5468427 if this ceasefire clause on pre 7 august positions is not applied quickly and in its entirety i will convoke an extraordinary council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5468428 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5468429 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5468430 we will have to determine if the russian intervention against its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response
5468431 in which case there will be inevitable consequences for its relations with the european union
5468432 i do not advise any knee jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement with the eu
5468433 our interest in this is as great as russia itself talks in the nato russian council are essential too because we need open lines of communication
5468434 some of russias actions were not proportionate but it is rare that all the blame is on one side in fact both sides are probably to blame
5468435 we must stick to the partnership with russia even after these recent events which of course do not please us

5468500 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5468501 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5468502 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5468503 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5468504 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5468505 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5468508 while it is possible that occasional sightings of free ranging mountain lions may occur in arkansas there is no evidence that there has been a reproducing population of this species in the state since the early 1900s individual mountain lions are most likely escaped or released pets though it is possible but unlikely that individuals could disperse to arkansas from their nearest existing population in southern texas
5468509 mountain lions range from 60 inches long from nose to tip of tail with 21 inch tails to nearly nine feet of which three feet are tail body weights range from 80 pounds to nearly 225 pounds

5468514 if you live anywhere near the vicinity of the aqueduct this time of year bears mountain lions cougars they all come up the aqueduct looking for food and water

5468574 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5468575 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5468576 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5468577 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

5468583 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5468584 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market

5468647 senator mccain has sent a clear signal that he would seek to end the massive deficits that have occurred during the bush administration and the last 10 years that the republicans controlled congress

5468651 this insanity must stop senator mccains embrace of deficit hawk david walker is a strong indicator to conservatives and independents that he intends to try to do something to stop these irresponsible deficits
5468652 i might note that david walker has also talked with the fiscal advisers of senator barack obama so perhaps there is something hopeful in that as well

5468656 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5468657 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5468658 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5468659 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable

5468692 the oil price is very important and is indeed part of the reason why weve seen investor sentiment look a bit stronger over the course of the last few weeks
5468693 short term it is still a pretty negative picture of slowing economic growth which continues to be a factor
5468694 you have stocks selling off and concerns continuing about the health of financial companies and this stokes the flight to quality bid for treasuries
5468695 the dollar is in a consolidative mode and with commodities up investors have taken that as an excuse to take the dollar lower
5468696 we have the necessary expertise and infrastructure to launch such a product and we hope to get the nod from sebi shortly
5468697 its now a broad perception that if oil eases below 110 a barrel you could see some moderation in the inflation number

5468755 what matthew does here with his version of the story is to make this conversation even more unlikely and even more shocking matthew basically turns this whole story into a parable he subverts peoples ideas of correct behavior and he calls into question his earliest readers long held prejudices you see when jewish christians of matthews day read this story they probably were not at all shocked by jesus initial words and behavior thats how you should talk to foreigners especially a foreign enemy like a canaanite thats even how you should talk to women in fact they would be most surprised by jesus talking to her at all people like her many thought should be ignored at best shes just lucky her particular ancestors werent slaughtered back in the day

5468787 members of the orange order belong to the institution because they are firmly committed to their reformed protestant faith and in a world where secular values are changing the societies in which we live our faith is important to us
5468788 they might think they are being smart issuing that type of answer but it is showing that they are burying their heads in the sand many members have been very positive about the suggestion internally but nothing has happened at an official level yet

5468790 the biennial pew research center report on changing news audiences describes 13 of the us public as
5468791 remarkably at a time when nearly all newspapers are losing sales and celebrity and mens magazines are reporting significant circulation losses the cerebral weeklies and monthlies continue to grow in the first half of this year the circulation of the oldie climbed 15 5 per cent to 28 862 compared with the same period last year the spectator rose 5 1 per cent to 76 952 the uk sale of the economist grew by 5 6 per cent year on year to 182 539 the week was up 4 5 per cent at 150 099 and prospects circulation rose 10 7 per cent to 27 552

5468797 as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex
5468798 it does not appear to be new semtex so it does not raise a concern with me that they have a new supply of semtex
5468799 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know
5468800 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups
5468801 but when it semtex was passed over to different groups how it came to be in their possession i dont know at this point in time
5468802 bid to exert control in nationalist areas in particular is continuing unabated
5468803 in the decade up to 2006 residential property prices in ireland rose more rapidly than in any other developed economy strong demand partly explains this incomes employment and population all grew robustly the increase in the supply of new housing was just as phenomenal the number of annual housing completions in 2006 was almost five times that of the early 1990s which compares with static output in the euro area and in the uk however when supply and demand fundamentals are considered in tandem the enormous increase in prices was unjustified consequently the countrys property market is now going sharply into reverse prices have been falling for 18 months and excess supply makes further declines all but inevitable in the event of an even sharper correction than is currently predicted the main lenders would probably suffer badly although irelands banks have been highly profitable over a long period and are thus well capitalised they are hugely exposed to the domestic property market the international credit crisis should it continue could cause serious financing problems for the banks adding to concerns about their balance sheets
5468804 the outlook for household spending growth in northern ireland is looking more subdued now than at any time since the early 1990s

5468812 martin the police did not plant the bomb your former associates did
5468813 he wanted to come round to the house to pay his respects but i didnt want that and we met in the hotel since then we have communicated intermittently over the years and i did meet him with gerry adams and gerry kelly but that meeting was not a terribly good one
5468814 nothing came of it and i was very disappointed by the response from adams in particular on friday i decided to send a text to martin mcguinness to again ask him to give that vital assistance and urge his fellow republicans to give the information that would convict the bombers but again he wouldnt agree to that but when sinn fein does take that step it will show that they are genuinely into peace and a system of justice which should protect everybody catholic and protestant

5468819 that is why my position is to support the calls that are made by families here for the establishment of an independent tribunal
5468820 they obviously have lost all faith and we have seen debacle after debacle in terms of the investigation of this terrible atrocity what we need to do is support the families in the demands they now make

5468830 the financial accounting standards board is not proposing that companies change their current accounting for the cost of ongoing litigation
5468831 im really tracing the back the documents all the way back to organizations trying to influence the governor on other things
5468832 we are seeing some things that should concern the people of west virginia
5468833 there is definitely a concerted effort in west virginia to close down the courthouse it just so happens in the story we are turning up documents directly related to it
5468834 i cant go into a lot of details right now this story is not just about dupont its about other associated industries and the u s chamber of commerce influencing the governors office and influencing regulatory agencies and courts in west virginia
5468835 our brief is solely based on the issue of due process and whether or not our supreme court follows the same standards as established by the u s supreme court with regard to the right to appeal punitive damages
5468836 we did not take sides in the actual case in any way and want any citizen that has been adversely affected to get the benefits and compensation that they deserve
5468837 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and his family go through we have to lend our support to this campaign
5468838 you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again
5468839 we have got to help we have got a voice that kids listen to it is unfortunate it is part of life part of culture these days and this is why we want to get involved we want to make a change
5468840 in the past maybe there wasnt a strong enough deterrent for carrying knives
5468841 it is not always the person intending to hurt someone who gets injured people carrying the knives also get hurt
5468842 boredom can set in a lot of times there is a lot of peer pressure and then something happens that everyone regrets
5468843 young people need to understand that carrying a knife just like carrying a gun is dangerous and wrong
5468844 but government and the police cant solve this problem by themselves we need to change the way young people think about knives we need families and communities working together and we need influential role models

5468855 without hesitation we said laurence fishburne he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range we had the opportunity to see mr fishburne in thurgood on broadway a few weeks ago and it was a truly profound experience the actor disappeared and thurgood marshall was standing there on the stage mr fishburne is also a talented writer and director if you distill csi down to its essence its a collaboration and we are so looking forward to collaborating with mr fishburne for all of us at csi this is truly a dream

5468870 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years
5468871 i thought it was awesome i was really excited when i heard about it and the fact that they are openly out there they look so happy together

5468875 while there has been higher compliance the higher number of returns is also because of better overall economic conditions in 2007 08 which created a lot of jobs and also pushed up the income levels of people

5468882 electric cars are not as economical as compared to cng vehicles since the latter is readily available at gas stations now the way out is to develop low carbon electricity technology for which the auto companies are looking at tying up with energy companies

5468913 the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
5468914 use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state
5468915 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
5468916 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5468917 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5468918 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5468919 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5468920 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5468921 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5468922 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5468923 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5468924 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5468925 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5468926 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5468927 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5468928 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5468929 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5468930 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5468931 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5468932 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5468933 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5468934 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5468935 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5468936 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5468937 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5468938 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5468939 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5468940 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5468941 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5468942 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5468943 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5468944 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5468945 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5468946 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5468947 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5468948 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5468949 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5468950 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5468951 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5468952 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5468953 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5468954 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5468955 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5468956 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5468957 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5468958 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5468959 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5468960 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5468961 you can sit here and tell your friends that this didnt happen but you know it did
5468962 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5468963 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5468964 anarchism really stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property liberation from the shackles and restraint of government
5468965 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5468966 this is a planning took where all things are going
5468967 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5468968 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5468969 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5468970 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5468971 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5468972 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5468973 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5468974 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5468975 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5468976 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5468977 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5468978 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5468979 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5468980 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5468981 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5468982 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5468983 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5468984 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5468985 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5468986 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5468987 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5468988 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5468989 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5468990 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5468991 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5468992 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5468993 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5468994 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5468995 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5468996 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

5469021 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5469022 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5469023 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5469024 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5469025 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5469026 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5469027 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5469028 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5469029 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5469030 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5469031 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5469032 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5469033 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5469034 they used us as a springboard but i wouldnt be jumping out of our skin if i was them thinking that theyre back
5469035 we didnt talk about the fact weve won the last seven times against them i did hear that a couple of times this week in dispatches
5469036 we wouldnt mind playing them every week at the moment
5469037 i think our performance tonight was reasonably dominant and i think physically we were very good
5469038 hes okay he put a bit of a scare in the camp but i think its just a cork on his knee
5469039 with that sort of injury he was told not to fly so hell be assessed by our doctors when he gets back
5469040 it was very disappointing not to be able to send a legend of our football club peter bell out on a high like we did for shaun mcmanus
5469041 and even though peter bell couldnt play for us yesterday he said before the game he wanted us to be able to play for him and it was very disappointing in the second half not to be able to send him off on a good note
5469042 i said to the group i want to see the side evolve when it is not going their way
5469043 i spoke about climbing over the mountain when it gets a little bit tough to get out of situations finding out about each other
5469044 i thought at times the players were not demanding enough of each other when st kilda were just kicking the ball around
5469045 the game is not that difficult from a basic thing like manning up when they have got the ball
5469046 at times you are not going to finish up on your direct opponent but it is how you cover for each other
5469047 we had too many guys sit back and be spectators when that happened
5469048 i want to set myself for the next couple of games and really finish off the year strongly
5469049 no decision has been made about the teams yet but we are very keen to go and be one of the clubs involved in the first afl match played over there
5469050 its a great opportunity there are growing cultural and population ties between india and australia
5469051 the tigers being a revered animal in that country would be a perfect fit for the indian market

5469058 im third generation british i came to america because ive always wanted to come here and now theyve got me so scared that all i want to do is go home were paying for your stupid war anyway
5469059 i know you are scared and doing your duty but you dont have to dehumanize and disrespect ohter human beings while you do this this job is not to allow you make up for all the other oppressions that have been heaped on your head by our capitalist system strike back at the mega rich if you want revenge not poor average citizens like me and these others
5469060 you may be able to get away with that kind of behavior up where you come from but down here we dont stand for it
5469061 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5469062 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama

5469070 well hes promoting what i would term a government takeover of the health system
5469071 he has said he wants to mandate free college tuition for every student in america
5469072 unlike ted kennedy he meant jack kennedy of course who said dont ask what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country he obama says were the wealthiest country in the world you should get this you should get that youre entitled to this youre entitled to that to me thats a move toward socialism
5469073 im familiar with what his work was here at the state capitol and to me the best indicator of future behavior is past behavior
5469074 and he has supported what i would consider to be socialistic moves on health care as a state senator
5469075 the expansion of the schip program represents a truly common sense and bipartisan solution that is plaguing many families especially those in our ninth congressional district
5469076 and i pledge to you i will fight this fight until we win
5469077 i continue to believe musharraf has done a pretty good job
5469078 prior to musharraf pakistan was a failed state they had corrupt governments and they would rotate back and forth and there was corruption and
5469079 i thinkmccain really did something extraordinary when the way he answered that question

5469119 when we took alone in the dark in 2001 it was to renew the franchise with names characters we tried to put it in a modern base and modernise it a little bit now i think that with this franchise if atari wants to do something further it has to be a major step towards other things perhaps other platforms other game systems other gameplay alone in the dark has this chance to have this fantastic title they have to work with that perhaps to be a little purer about it and move away from what has become the classical survival horror game with resident evil biohazard and let it be alone in the dark when you forget that theres been four or five instalments in the franchise you can do something fantastic with it

5469127 we are now witnessing the blossoming of a canadian cabin style so many contemporary designers and artisans reject cookie cutter aesthetics in favour of local materials and indigenous motifs in contrast with their predecessors however current makers infuse this traditional iconography with whimsy and innovation

5469130 the objectives were to provide product trial among a key physician group to accelerate uptake of vioxx as the second entrant in a highly competitive new class and gather data important to this customer group
5469131 the advantage trial utilized this important group of prescribers as investigators in addition to gaining experience with vioxx many of these physicians gained a highly coveted introduction to clinical research
5469132 without access to internal documents the intent of pharmaceutical companies in conducting clinical trials is nearly impossible to prove even with access to internal documents study intent may be hard to prove

5469134 if journals are interested in publishing findings that are new and likely to change practice they are likely to turn down seeding trials
5469135 we thought there was an important message in the trial but not the one that merck was pushing
5469136 having been burned on this one were going to be more careful
5469137 simply shining a bright light on their existence may have already sown the seeds of their destruction
5469138 the next step would be a societal consensus that it is wrong to deceive institutional review boards and participants about the true purpose of a trial

5469160 we owe it to the victims to not allow inmates to continue to run their enterprises from behind our bars
5469161 inmates can make calls and conduct criminal enterprises from a cell phone if we dont try to limit that
5469162 the cell phones are utilized to go around get unrestricted access to the community and thats not a good thing things can occur bad things can occur that way
5469163 i first really wasnt too keen on the idea i didnt think theyd be able to separate the odor of the phone versus a lot of the stuff thats in the institution
5469164 these institutions are like cities and a lot of goods and materials and people have to come in and out all the time
5469165 we bring in boxes truckloads of things all the time so we have to have methods and procedures and policies to search these things and keep them out
5469166 those are the ones that were looking for and those are the ones we have zero tolerance for
5469167 theyre jeopardizing everybody else that works in the facility and we cannot tolerate that

5469180 its been a wonderful summer but were getting ready to go back to school
5469181 i think kids if they start later theyre going to go to bed later
5469182 high school students simply do better are more awake and more alert when they sleep more and the physiology of a student the biorhythms have them stay up later and get up later
5469183 so if you match school times more to student physiology academic achievement and all kinds of social and emotional issues with students improve

5469197 clients often prefer them to the gigantic cruise ships which can feel like nothing more than interchangeable floating hotels

5469199 but only one company acts as the clearinghouse for that yacht and handles their actual booking schedule

5469203 a ship is handcrafted especially the interiors we work with artisans and creative people who are really creating one of a kind features
5469204 i took the name to heart when designing this ship so i came up with splendid concepts for each area
5469205 the guest onboard is really my client and they just want to get away and not be reminded of home
5469206 nothing pleases me more as a designer than when someone notices something new at different points in the cruise and finds it interesting
5469207 i honestly cant think of any reason why it would be a good idea to pay for airline tickets with cash you miss out on too many benefits from protection in case of bankruptcy to points or miles accrual
5469208 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5469209 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
5469210 are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq
5469211 first he obama opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail
5469212 then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5469213 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5469214 good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded ten days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5469215 veterans should never be deprived of quality medical care and mental health care coverage for illness or injury incurred as a result of their service to our country

5469239 from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry
5469240 how despicably have i acted i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly

5469249 valuable opportunities are also derived from the overall migration to ip the creation of customized solutions for smbs and the bundling of data services with it telecom products and managed services
5469250 the advantages of data communication services are completely unknown for many small and medium businesses restraining a full expansion of these solutions
5469251 operators have now created new sales force structures focusing on medium and small sized companies offering clients adequate and accessible data solutions and working on exposing the benefits
5469252 with a data communications solution the information travels through the service providers network without accessing internet
5469253 depending on how you look at the forecast and depending on whether or not we can actually meet the challenges at hand the forecast is at best partly sunny
5469254 we hope that its not a catalog of things that have been done so much as a series of ideas about what we could do what could be done
5469255 if we are to meet the challenges that we face i believe what is required are governmental led initiatives that are matched by and propelled by a kind of bottom up grassroots movement
5469256 i dont think you can have one without the other
5469257 ive never curated a show of this scale nor one where we expected this kind of audience
5469258 i said wait a minute hold on this is the stupidest idea ive ever heard
5469259 he stiller said i know isnt it great i thought in the right context it could be entertaining or disastrous theres that thing of the risk factor for any creative idea or any venture the only difference being that i had a lot of goodwill from iron man and i was just apprehensive to not squander it
5469260 that was my fear my fear is going oh something is going to change that look you deal with sensitive topics whether youre in a comedic context or not nowadays its just you know its very very very convenient to pick things apart
5469261 i remember coming up watching comedies like this things that were really off kilter and really largely in poor taste but still made by people that we knew
5469262 my response to that its interesting because at different phases i can have different takes on it one is like well isnt that the whole idea the country is based on we can express this and that its all kind of business as usual its strange to me were taking flack from a disabilities support group with all the other archetypes and stereotypes
5469263 since the september 16 2007 incident we have said that based on statements of company personnel who were directly involved we believe those involved acted appropriately
5469264 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual

5469270 most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5469271 after the elections the nation wanted solutions from the new government
5469272 but the politicians could not do so a personal vendetta was started
5469273 i am confident that not a single charge can stand against me
5469274 i have not done anything for my personal gain whatever i have done i have done it for pakistan
5469275 leading pakistan is not an easy task and anyone doing it comes under a lot of criticism
5469276 in the start most pakistanis were for him and he still has some supporters especially because the new government which promised to do things differently has failed to do much in the past 100 days in power
5469277 he wanted to serve the country and to be different
5469278 he brought parliamentary reforms he brought women into the parliament
5469279 he in a way always believed in a unity of command a very centralized command which means his command in fact

5469281 mccain answers questions by telling stories obama answers like an academic i think people like storytellers better than professors they will like mccains simple yes and no responses obama tries to show he would be a good leader by recognizing nuance and complexity mccain tries to show he would be a good leader by being decisive
5469282 to grant that abortion is a moral issue but to duck when human life begins is at best inconsistent one would think it is vital no pun intended to think though exactly that question obamas unguarded line about not punishing a daughter of his with a child really hurt him in the pro life movement
5469283 obama has correctly refocused the abortion question on how women experience pregnancy and abortion for far too long the discussion has focused solely on fetuses as if they exist somehow independent of the women in whose bodies they reside
5469284 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
5469285 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5469286 obama will be hammered by the religious right for that pay grade answer
5469287 specious obama has made that very determination in opening the law wide to the killing of the unborn
5469288 specifically says that neither biologists nor doctors nor theologians can agree upon the moral status of the fetus
5469289 absolute certainty that the woman herself does have moral status then the conservative thing to do is to protect the womans interests first
5469290 still does not answer the question of what to do when there is a conflict with the rights of the woman
5469291 if he believes in human rights at the moment of conception then he ought to be against embryonic stem cell research ivf and even the so called rhythm method
5469292 which has the effect of timing intercourse not only to prevent conception but also to allow conception at a time when the fertilized egg will drop into a uterus that is not at the right time of month for implantation
5469293 evaded the question of whether he will or will not continue to support embryonic stem cell research as long as the scientists say it is necessary
5469294 odd not to ask it after all if you are going to talk to someone about religion youd be interested to know their thoughts about the central figure in their religion
5469295 is why there were not representatives from other faith communities who are also voting this is a multi religious nation
5469296 personal testimony and scripture citation are both treasured by evangelicals
5469297 mccains knowledge and strong stance for what is just and right he also expressed a sense of humor that i have not seen before

5469337 its been a very rewarding experience and has provided some much needed perspective on what i will choose to do with my life after princeton
5469338 my studies at princeton have definitely influenced my desire to work in social justice and specifically with people of disempowered minorities
5469339 it is this strength that inspired me to pursue fieldwork at the grassroots level and to talk with residents in stressed communities
5469340 challenge their assumptions of being unable to ever attain a degree from a school of prestige

5469362 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama

5469448 the cell phones are utilized to go around get unrestricted access to the community and thats not a good thing things can occur bad things can occur that way
5469449 i first really wasnt too keen on the idea i didnt think theyd be able to separate the odor of the phone versus a lot of the stuff thats in the institution
5469450 these institutions are like cities and a lot of goods and materials and people have to come in and out all the time

5469495 es un jugador completo aporta en todas las facetas del juego puede anotar pero no es un jugador ego sta y pasa bien la pelota sobre todo destaca entrando a canasta tanto en uno contra uno como en pick amp roll es muy h bil cerca del aro en el manejo de las dos manos y la ltima temporada ha progresado mucho en el tiro exterior siendo capaz de crearse sus propios tiros e ir a por el rebote a nivel defensivo destacar a que est siempre concentrado y que tiene intuici n para el robo
5469496 que vaya cedido a un equipo en el que pueda jugar minutos y puede seguir con su evoluci n

5469501 can thank a handful of muslim goofballs who cant quite grasp that trying to censor an author who claims muslims in western countries arent embracing western traditions of individual liberty is perhaps not the most effective rebuttal of the authors thesis
5469502 we have been discussing this for some time reconsidering the notion of an ideal venue and looking at sites around the city
5469503 we have also surveyed our audience to see what aspects of the festival it liked such as the ability to picnic and comfortable seating
5469504 we dont want uncertainty however we see this as a great opportunity to make ourselves open to a bigger audience and a new future
5469505 getting to rerecord a classic song like this was a real honor for us and we hope it helps inspire people to vote

5469507 the railroads starting point in the discussion is that they dont want to pay for anything

5469509 the port of oakland could really grow if we could get the rail capacity we need down the line

5469514 we cant wait on the railroads sitting and waiting and talking were wasting time
5469515 but we see that as the first place we would need to expand
5469516 the ports of los angeles and long beach are close to reaching capacity and the port of oakland really wants to capitalize on that

5469545 i did stuff like that when i was nineteen as well like get a tattoo because it pi ed my mum off

5469547 weve tried to keep winnsboro on the map especially with the insurance agencies
5469548 originally we were heavily a farm agency we wrote a lot of farm stuff theres hardly any farms insured now
5469549 richard winn academy was by far the biggest claim we ever had
5469550 it was well over a million dollars there was literally nothing standing after that tornado
5469551 back then we used independent insurance adjusters and we called bill beck our adjuster and asked him to meet us at the office the next morning at six the next morning he did peni filled up the coffee pot put a big open sign on the door and we were here to take calls
5469552 catastrophe adjusters arrived shortly after that set up a trailer and began working the company had a special adjuster for richard winn and he took care of everything found them a place to meet and started lining up contractors

5469563 well see if they can turn their attention to governance and get a handle on their problems
5469564 they have been using the musharraf thing as an excuse for non governance
5469565 this is really the moment of truth for pakistan if this fails it is unclear what will happen
5469566 it will take the new government a full year to work things out on counterterrorism a year to make the mistakes they have to make it is a huge experiment
5469567 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing
5469568 pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5469569 were confident that we will maintain a good relationship with the government of pakistan
5469570 had a good meeting with the prime minister a couple of weeks ago in washington the pakistanis realize that the threat of terrorism the threat of extremism is a threat to them as well as the rest of the world
5469571 he hasnt effectively been leading pakistan for the last six months
5469572 youre truly not going to see any great changes in pakistan with musharrafs resignation with the exception you will start to see greater political infighting among the coalition partners
5469573 you could count on him to make tough decisions even though you could never count on him to completely follow through
5469574 it will probably be much harder to get decisive action as we did with musharraf the good news is that the democracy process is moving forward and it may be possible to create a more durable political framework
5469575 i didnt go for the big bomb every time i thought id try some different things heading into the u s open

5469579 it is tough on your legs it is just your body needs more time

5469581 hes well thought of around here hes been a warrior for this organization we were all hoping that by this time he would be in a position to compete and he hasnt been able to very difficult injury
5469582 she had not been suffering from any previous illness and simply died peacefully of old age
5469583 we know the channels of distribution and we know who is running the business but the problem is neither we nor the americans can do anything because the place is under the protection of the russian military
5469584 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5469585 shes got problems just like all of us have about what happened to my mum
5469586 ive been in therapy not long ago and she has had a hard time
5469587 thats why she has done drugs and why this wedding happened too were all depressed in our family

5469589 if you guys are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody
5469590 have me as a man who ended a relationship stand here and write some truth have me stand up for somebody and write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met
5469591 why are you asking me that question im being as honest as i can possibly can be
5469592 i ended a relationship because there is no lying i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right i dont waste peoples time
5469593 i guarantee you that 20 percent of the people on this street right now who are in a relationship wish they could get out but they dont know how and im going to be honest on the way in to my relationships and im going to be honest on the way out of my relationships

5469599 when from march to may russia imposed an escalating series of import restrictions first on wine vegetables and fruits then on sparkling wine and brandy finally georgian mineral water at the time one of the countrys most important exports
5469600 russian authorities denied basic rights to many of the detained
5469601 including access to a lawyer or the possibility of appealing the expulsion decision taken against them most were given trials lasting only a few minutes georgians were held in sometimes appalling conditions of detention and in some cases were subjected to threats and other ill treatment two georgians died in custody awaiting expulsion
5469602 that columns of russian tanks and troops had crossed georgias sovereign borders the thousands of troops tanks and artillery amassed on our border are evidence of how long russia had been planning this aggression
5469603 good dubstep has that release and restraint that push and that pull
5469604 the bartenders have told us weve knocked some bottles off the wall
5469605 one assumes that saakashvili thought the u s would back him strongly enough to scare russia off that however is again a major miscalculation the basic reality about georgia is that russia cares much much much more about what happens there than does the united states of america one wonders whether saakashvili just didnt understand this somehow or else if there were specific contacts of his inside the united states who gave him bad information of some kind
5469606 hmmm if someone was homeless this would be a really good way of getting somewhere to stay sleep on a different couch every night

5469613 in a profession where success courage and image are important mr daniels wanted to avoid an unnecessary deployment that could hurt his standing among his peers and reduce his prospects for choice assignments and promotion
5469614 its ridiculous with all the years of service its not like he was a ladder climbing person at all

5469616 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
5469617 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
5469618 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
5469619 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
5469620 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
5469621 russia should welcome having democracies on its border not threaten them
5469622 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5469623 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5469624 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5469625 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5469626 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5469627 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5469628 one man is confirmed dead at the scene and another two people have been seriously injured
5469629 of the two seriously injured one has been airlifted to selly oak hospital and one has been airlifted to university hospital north staffordshire
5469630 twenty or so other patients have been taken to hospital
5469631 a further patient with a head injury has also been transferred by land ambulance to university hospital north staffordshire
5469632 six other patients have been immobilised using spinal boards and neck collars and also transferred to university hospital north staffordshire by land ambulance
5469633 a further nine patients have suffered minor injuries and have been transferred to local hospitals for further treatment
5469634 the decision was lets not build out anymore lets build up

5469649 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5469650 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5469651 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5469652 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5469653 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5469654 we are offended and we want to settle the score
5469655 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests that the men will settle for anything he has put everyone down
5469656 were going to get together to put forward our opinion
5469657 we have received calls from past mt isa residents who are currently living overseas and read about the mayors comments online theyre shocked and outraged
5469658 there are much more serious regional and economic issues plaguing our town than what we all look like
5469659 were in discussions now about what were going to do exactly
5469660 weve got a saying up here that the odds are good but the goods are odd
5469661 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5469664 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5469665 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5469666 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5469667 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5469668 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5469669 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5469670 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5469671 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5469672 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5469673 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5469674 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5469675 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5469676 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5469677 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5469678 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

5469680 to be honest with you im getting my wedding ring upgraded im getting it hooked up shes going to get hers upgraded too
5469681 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5469682 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5469683 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5469684 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5469685 this cannot be done using visual memory but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5469686 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words
5469687 in our recent work we have demonstrated that piraha speakers achieve high accuracy on matching tasks despite having no count words whatsoever not even a word for one
5469688 we need to make trade logistics and border infrastructure a priority in the short term or lose opportunities to other global competitors who are better organized to facilitate trade
5469689 on oil alone canada has been the largest supplier to the u s since 1999 not saudi arabia not kuwait nor any other producer from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries
5469690 canada is a stable supplier of energy to the u s whether it is gas and oil in the west or integrated electricity grids in the east
5469691 and being close means lower delivery costs than most other power suppliers
5469692 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure

5469703 the truck of fresh compromises pulls up each day and by the end of the film you look at the finished print and think unutterable thoughts
5469704 no director in history knows more about compromise than terry gilliam

5469706 i just dont think i can do it justice by reducing it down to a film i keep thinking it would be better as a miniseries a five hour miniseries is what i think watchmen should be when you reduce it down to a 2 hour film youre taking so much textured detail out that it kind of loses what its about

5469780 because of his actions at the scene and things he said our officers at the scene knew this individual had some mental health issues he was taken to the hospital by police he had to be physically restrained in order to be put in the police vehicle
5469781 he clipped a vehicle just prior to hitting the kelowna residents he missed most of it but caught the bumper then he carried on and thats when he hit the kelowna couple
5469782 at one point the driver was told to stop the vehicle when he did he was pulled from the front seat put in the rear seat the victim was then assaulted several times when police located the victim he had injuries to his face and arms
5469783 one of the suspects was arrested and will be appearing in court monday facing charges of robbery assault with a weapon assault causing bodily harm forcible confinement and breach of probation order the second suspect is facing charges of robbery assault causing bodily harm and forcible confinement
5469784 someone could have up to three dogs up to three cats and up to three others be it rabbits lizards or other if they want more than three of any one type of animal they would have to apply for a permit
5469785 existing pets would be grandfathered in we arent going to make anyone give up their pets for adoption if the bylaw gets passed
5469786 its been extreme the different points of view weve received one man who called was totally against it and another said the bylaw doesnt go far enough
5469787 he followed the vehicle some 15 kilometres and then attacked it with a pitch fork causing some 1400 damage to the cab the victim locked himself in the truck and called 9 1 1 as the damage was being inflicted
5469788 at the time it wasnt clear if there was damage to the beams its taken some time to determine that and an approximate value
5469789 as i was passing a pickup truck in the other lane a dog riding in the back jumped out of the vehicle it was tied to the truck with a long length of chain
5469790 it was just awful i turned around to help the owners but the dog was covered in blood he was limp and lifeless when i got to them the owners were in shock one of them called 911 because the owners didnt know what else to do i gave them the number and directions for a local vet but i dont know what happened after that
5469791 this poor animal his chain was too long he had too much mobility in the back of the truck and he took advantage of it there are proper ways to secure a dog the best being having them ride inside the vehicle with a pet restraint or a secured crate if they are travelling in the back of a truck
5469792 for the most part people just dont realize how to secure their dog properly they think any length of chain or rope is fine because thats how theyve always done it i feel so bad for the family of this dog they were well meaning by using a chain to secure it they didnt mean for this happen they did have him restricted but it just wasnt enough
5469793 there is a fine of 109 under the motor vehicle act for failure to properly secure an animal while in transport but i dont think a lot of people know that
5469794 most of the calls we get about dogs in cars are to do with them trapped in vehicles on hot days people are starting to call in more and more about that because they are becoming familiar with the bylaw
5469795 its really motivated me to organize some educational clinics on pet safety in a blink of eye people can lose their pet if they dont know how to properly secure them id like to help make them aware of how to do that

5469805 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5469806 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5469807 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5469808 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5469809 oh my goodness watch the funny way his face looks when hes running desperatly somewhere
5469810 hey look at that man i dont think hes doing anything funny but i have an uncontrollable urge to crack up when he runs past me

5469822 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5469823 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5469824 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5469825 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5469826 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5469827 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5469828 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5469829 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5469830 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5469831 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5469832 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5469833 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5469834 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5469835 who are open to doing something on the production side
5469836 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5469837 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5469838 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5469839 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

5469842 in this historic political year air america will be bringing our unique brand of opinion radio to both conventions keeping the democrats on their toes and keeping the conservative far f right honest or at least less dishonest our goal is to be politically direct and incorrect and to cut through all the standard talking points and the on the one hand and on the other hand coverage by the mainstream media well be reaching out to all air americans and progressive patriots on our 60 affiliates and xm and to all those who want to stream us live

5469861 why did jesus appear first to a woman after his resurrection
5469862 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5469863 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5469864 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5469865 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5469866 wir haben zu wenig nach vorne getan deshalb kann ich mit dem spiel nicht zufrieden sein
5469867 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5469868 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5469869 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5469870 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5469871 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5469872 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5469873 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5469874 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5469875 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5469876 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5469877 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5469878 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5469879 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5469880 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5469881 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5469882 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5469883 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5469884 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5469885 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5469886 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5469887 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5469888 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5469889 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5469890 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5469891 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5469892 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
