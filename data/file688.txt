6880000 likewise there has been nothing more on xabi alonso at the beginning of the summer we were looking at ways of raising money but now we are happy with xabi he is a very good player
6880001 the offer we had was not good enough so why would we want to sell him
6880002 we hope fernando can create his piece of club history and then maybe more in the future
6880003 steven has had two injuries he was 10 15 days without training and then it happened again that is why he did not start the match two weeks ago against standard liege
6880004 clearly in a couple of weeks he will be back to his best he has needed time to get fit after his injuries and it has been important to protect him
6880005 steven has great game intelligence and he can play anywhere gerrard played with intelligence and england drew that is all i would want to say about it
6880006 we know what the best position for gerrard is but he is capable of playing in other positions
6880007 we know where he can play really well and we know where he likes to play we will concentrate on using him to his strengths

6880013 itll be a cauldron and a fortress and a 12th man all the players are looking forward to playing in front of this crowd it can be a very intimidating place and we dont hope it will be a 12th man we know it will be
6880014 we rely upon that because its great to have home support we came away from liege where their support was terrific but weve also had great support there and at sunderland
6880015 its always nice to get back to anfield and hear that roar and hopefully it can lift the players and they can put the frighteners up middlesbrough
6880016 we know they had a great win on the opening day and it will be a difficult game for us there are no easy games anymore i know its a clich but the more i look at it the more i realise there arent any easy games and we can expect a real test
6880017 if you win regularly things fall into place but we must keep working hard and make sure we win the next game
6880018 we cant look any further than that if we keep doing that hopefully we can get the success we feel we are capable of achieving
6880019 we want to improve on a daily basis im not going to give false promises apart from saying that everyone is working tirelessly to get back to where we feel we belong and i think we all know where we belong
6880020 this is a great league we know the difficulties but we also know the rewards and it would be a great league to win everyone has the ambition and desire to gain success and we all know what we have to do
6880021 i knew about him beforehand and had a good relationship when i was at bolton hes a football man hes a great man his attention to detail is fantastic and hes a terrific guy to work with

6880023 wmc has evolved from being a strategically focused business organization to being a bunch of whiny snidely political lobbyists and bar denizens at the madison club
6880024 this combined with wmcs wealth and undeniable political influence and effectiveness has made wmc the single biggest driver of our toxic political environment and thus the single biggest obstacle to the recovery of wisconsins economy

6880028 you people really dont have any clue yet of the true heinousness of what ive done
6880029 i was not searching for a child but rather i was on a rampage
6880030 rape and kill until i was killed preferring death over capture
6880031 i was on a rampage i hated myself and i hated you
6880032 i knew the best way to hurt you was the way i was hurt an eye for an eye but the system didnt take my eye it took my heart and my innocence and i wanted to do the same to it
6880033 evidence consistently shows that i have been honest that i have been forthcoming
6880034 for some reason that changed and i think the evidence supports that also
6880035 i should thank them but i wont despite the heinousness of all my crimes and the sickness the insanity the evidence shows clearly that completely contrary to all my life experience that something happened
6880036 this is not for my own salvation but this is for yours and the hope of all of us together
6880037 there is a significant reduction in crime compared to this time last year
6880038 the atmosphere around the festival continues to be very good
6880039 however i would urge people not to increase their chances of becoming a victim of crime by leaving their valuables unattended in a tent
6880040 la calidad de la carne que consumen los colombianos es preocupante este es uno de los alimentos que puede ocasionar graves afecciones para la salud si no se preserva de la manera correcta la lucha de minprotecci n y del invima es vigilar que los mataderos tengan agua potable realicen los sacrificios del ganado de forma a rea desalojen la zona donde trabajan de cualquier animal que pueda trasmitir diferentes tipos de bacteria
6880041 la idea es extinguir los mataderos regionales es decir los que trabajan en cada municipio para impulsar los nacionales y as se pueda abastecer de carne en buen estado a todas las famas del pa s
6880042 no hay tantas inconsistencias en la salud como dice la procuradur a
6880043 whoever is ranked i can support either one but i can only hang my hat on the recommendation of dr beitsh trinity
6880044 i moved for land capital its my understanding that the afro american group favored land capital
6880045 i would have to pick the group that will help this community the most
6880046 regardless of who does get picked i feel that we could reject a proposal if it didnt meet the covenant with the community
6880047 trinity has an actual track record of project of this scale and community involvement
6880048 i think land capital brought in a good lobbying group that would better enable grants from washington
6880049 i think weve mishandled this process severly so far but allowing it to take place in the newspaper and in the press
6880050 he who rejects change is the architect of decay the only human institution which rejects progress is the cemetery
6880051 were always evaluating whats happening in the marketplace and certainly something thats happening in the last couple of months is that sonys managed to sell some boxes
6880052 so whether or not you like developing for that platform if theyve got millions of people connected to that platform and buying their games you have to take it seriously
6880053 theyre in the race now so weve got to re evaluate that for what it is
6880054 theres zero chance of it happening this year its something thats being talked about right now as the game is gaining popularity and looking like its going to be a hit
6880055 if we were not given the six months there is a really high likelihood that we would no bid the program
6880056 i would rather not turn in a losing proposal than turn in one thats not competitive
6880057 boeings real point here is that the government has changed its requirements for a tanker so the company needs more time to modify its proposal
6880058 by putting it the way they have they have set it up for a formal protest
6880059 why would they spend millions of dollars on ads and lawyers and question their customers decision if they just intended to drop out
6880060 a new administration wont change anything because procurement rules are rules
6880061 there is also renewed technical selling and talk again of demand destruction the dollar is strong again too
6880062 my one bronze medal which i would have loved for it to be a third gold medal will by no means put a damper on the experiences that the lopezes have had in beijing
6880063 you cant dismiss the fact that we created even more history
6880064 it steves medal wasnt the color that we intended but weve got three lopezes and they came as olympians and they left as olympic medalists
6880065 we dont feel we were provided with a level playing field
6880066 we watched the actual leg lift on video and steven held his leg in the air
6880067 the italian player decided he was going to attempt to kick trying to draw a warning he kicked directly into stevens leg shin to shin that shin to shin is not a warning
6880068 they called me for it and it shouldnt have happened its just unfortunate that they called me for it with seconds left
6880069 we should have been notified of the decision the criteria the methodology used what evidence was presented
6880070 the referee should be sanctioned and the correction should be made in that case steven would win the match because he would not have a deduction point
6880071 but there is pride these are the olympic games and ive trained long and hard for this i think i would have made a statement with the judges here by withdrawing
6880072 i believe that the people back home deserve a bronze medal and not winning anything would have been worse and i think about the united state add another medal to the count
6880073 im upset gollee geez im upset i love winning i hate losing

6880078 when poor judging happens to you youre told to shut up and not say anything because of what will happen to you or what will happen to the sport
6880079 if this is truly what taekwondo is about maybe taekwondo shouldnt be in the olympics maybe they should fix it
6880080 unacceptable could mean anything from we didnt file the papers properly to we didnt use the right color pencil
6880081 under the wtf competition rules we should have been notified about the decision the criteria the methodology used what evidence was presented and what referees were reviewing it we were not
6880082 we were threatened not to protest at this event i think that needs to be said we were made to sign a document not to protest for the betterment of taekwondo it was a very big thing there was a table you went up to the table and you signed the document you signed it in front of the secretary general of the wtf and you gave him the document
6880083 it is not an agreement i would call it a resolution
6880084 a resolution on fair play it was do your best to ensure fair play and judging appealing is up to them its their right and their rule they can appeal
6880085 participants in wtf olympic coach seminar adopt resolution on fair play
6880086 respect and accept the judgment and decisions of the refereeing and technical officials in all taekwondo competitions
6880087 the wtf wanted everybody to have more self control and if they want to make a protest take the correct procedure actually not to jump up and down and make a ruckus raise a lot of noise
6880088 take the correct procedure to go about it file the complaint and then theyll decide
6880089 wtf officials dont think about the repercussions until after they make a mistake
6880090 they know the power we have as a family and bringing limelight to our sport

6880128 probably they are concerned about the reaction of those who will disagree with a memorial like this
6880129 there are 205 nocs national olympic committees participating in the olympics and there are more than a few dozen that will strongly disagree with this kind of event
6880130 this murder is the blackest event in the history of the olympics it is good to see that despite this israel continues to move forward and grow as a nation in general and in regards to its sports in particular
6880131 this is not an israeli issue this concerns the whole olympic family our sons fathers and husbands were no accidental tourists or visitors to the games they were part of it they believed in the spirit and the dreams of the olympics but they all came home in a coffin
6880132 senderos there is nothing definite but the market is open until august 31
6880133 the lad has got two tremendous clubs to pick from then if his dad is right we are looking for three more players to come in before the deadline but they have got to be the right players we need definitely one more defender theres no doubt about that
6880134 one of my first professional singing gigs was at the arkansas state fair when i was 16 years old i was a member of a group called team 11 a group of teenagers from all over the st louis area i remember going on right after a livestock judging so there we were in our glittering costumes full makeup and big hair dancing and singing on a stage covered with chicken poo and feathers very glamorous stuff
6880135 when life gives you lemons you paint that s gold
6880136 the whole purpose of hip hop in the first place was to make the best of things
6880137 you had a whole lot of disenfranchised disempowered people with plenty of things to worry about coming together in parks and basements to party and forget about their problems
6880138 we wanted to make a quieter album and that was one of the songs that sparked it all off i should note we made a double album but i realized how ridiculous that is today i missed my chance i shouldve done that five years ago but it focused things
6880139 theres no drums for so long you never know if theyre going to hit when they do finally hit its like here we go the album is starting i see the first song as more of an intro than an actual song the lyrics come from a conversation i had with a friend of mine about the minneapolis music scene i was so disappointed in the things he had to say hopefully hell hear this and hear my side of the conversation since he wasnt trying to hear me that day
6880140 this song is not really about a pimp its actually about cigarettes ive been fighting with cigarettes for a long time and you know im still on the losers end of it but i kind of figured if i write a song about cigarettes and how much theyre pimping me that could be the motivation to quit
6880141 its a move into some poppier stuff than what me and ant usually do i think its important to show those sides of us as long as we show them for the right reasons theres another song you that comes later and its twice as poppy i wanted dreamer to come before you so it transitions you and doesnt just smack you in the head
6880142 it was a b to do i had a hard time coming to grips with that song
6880143 when ant played me the beat it reminded me of prince like the dirty mind era so i knew i wanted to make a real dirty racy song but i didnt want to get too dirty and racy because im getting too old for that s so i had to figure out how to make a gross song without too much drug stuff and too much sex stuff i used the narrative to imply the grossness of the story theres still the f word in the chorus and theres a couple other words that arent you know happy words its an old song i almost feel like what im saying coulda shoulda woulda been said on you cant imagine how much fun were having back in 05 its kind of a cheater
6880144 its the poppiest s ive ever done and it scares me because i dont know what people are going to think about it the funny thing is i dont consider what people are going to think when im making it but once its done and theres nothing left i can do about it thats when i start to get neurotic it is fellow rapper brother alis favorite song on the record his wife told me he sings the chorus around the house to me it cant get no better than that
6880145 it was fun to do its a couple of people just laughing and having fun hopefully that comes through
6880146 ant knew someone who played lap steel guitar so we used it to capture a certain darkness it may be the first time a lap steel guitar is used in a rap song
6880147 i dont want to say its trendy but its contagious for everybody to take issue with whats going on in this presidential administration its become the new thing when even losers like myself started to pay attention to politics that was a sign to me but every time ive tried to say something socially worthy it always comes off preachy and i dont like being that guy i never really did a great job of alluding to what the songs really about for the most part i think people are going to think its about a hangover my friend tunde adebimpe of tv on the radio sings backup vocals on it its real subtle i thought he stole the show from me which is the only reason i turned him way down
6880148 its the most optimistic beat on the album and i wanted to write a sad song on top of this happy piano joint its about missing someone and really coming to terms with what that means its about my dad
6880149 we did a benefit for a friend of ours maybe a year or so ago i didnt want to bring the whole band up into this small small venue so just me and the guitar player took a bunch of my songs and made quick vocal guitar renditions of them this is one of the songs we did and we liked it so much we decided to record it its one take it told the story
6880150 it balances you its pretty self explanatory i called it me because its about me i feel like it should be the be all end all of me writing any more songs about relationship turmoil or my co dependencies its like this is how i am this is why im like this so hopefully itll sink in to myself and help self fulfill my prophecy of eventually running for mayor you guys are laughing at that thats great
6880151 if you listen to the chorus you could see why i actually looked into tracking down tom jones to sing it with me i mean i didnt go too far but i looked into it that song gave me a glimpse into what my life is going to be like when i actually do have to go work in vegas because its coming im not going to quit ever even when they fire me im just going to go to vegas
6880152 this was probably the biggest challenge its based on a sample and we were trying to find the original sound they made we had maybe 10 synthesizers all kinds of them we had two keyboardists me guitarist nate collis and our engineer joe mabbott all playing
6880153 you shouldve seen all five of them playing synths at the same time it looked like devo
6880154 tom waits beatboxes on it im friends with his son weve known each other for quite a while now going on five or six years and i finally asked him i think literally have i known you long enough now to ask if i can get in touch with your dad or is that offensive so i sent him the song and asked if hed sing the chorus he sent it back and totally avoided the chorus but instead beatboxed on it and it sounds good it worked we kept it subtle i didnt want to be exploitive i wanted to make sure it made sense musically and i think ultimately it really did
6880155 its boeings responsibility to look after the long term bottom line and its the unions desire to take advantage of short term prosperity these are not reconcilable interests
6880156 our members are fired up and the company has to address the issues or there wont be any planes being built after september 3rd
6880157 we listened to the unions ideas and are carefully considering the issues they raised
6880158 followed by a leering octave bass run punctuated by glorious horns
6880159 its by no means perfect theres no telling what might have been had the recording process been smoother with fewer delays less complications still its hard to quibble with the whole from the songs and the playing to the artwork and westerbergs timeless and hilarious self immolating notes
6880160 by the late summer of 1982 largely because of this record the replacements were cementing their reputation as minneapolis most exciting new group and the possibilities seemed limitless
6880161 i think its the first album that sounds just like us
6880162 hootenanny is a sonic and lyrical template for every mats album that followed and it set the stage for the rest of their roller coaster of a career it changed the band their audience and the local music scene
6880163 the replacements 1984 masterpiece was either the second of a five record streak of greatness of the first of a three record streak
6880164 do what i want and take the consequences later because theyre never gonna be followed up on because the argument that something could have happened is made moot by my safe return

6880194 the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time
6880195 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6880196 its a very good feeling to see the georgian police here i feel so much better but things are still very hard
6880197 if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces
6880198 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region

6880207 perlmutter also introduced the companys second generation dual core mobile processors for increasingly popular ultra thin and light notebook pcs
6880208 there were many tense expeditions when we were in close proximity to soviet submarines and ships
6880209 being on a sub it was constantly impressed upon us who the enemy was there would be little posters reminding us to be quiet if you accidentally closed a hatch or door too hard that sound could actually emit out into the water and give your position away
6880210 for about two weeks we were in the north atlantic in a covert area and it was necessary to remain at periscope depth which is 50 feet under water
6880211 it was hard to stay at that depth without breaking the surface and giving away our position it was extremely tense for those two weeks wed spend six hour watches in the control room just leaning over the steering mechanism with our eyes glued to the gauges as the sub bobbed up and down in the water another time we were discovered by the soviets and had to make a quick getaway
6880212 it was as close to the real thing as we could get
6880213 we had the missile launchers ready and we were all manned up we could go to war at a seconds notice not a minutes notice
6880214 while we were doing it we were using our radar to look into russia but of course we didnt tell them that
6880215 i said were not going out on deck we dont know if theyre shooting or what we checked every missile and it was the only time that ive ever seen the ready to load light steady on the monitor we sat there for a long time and eventually the captain came on and said what happened and to stand down
6880216 you lived under an air of suspicion and intrigue at the same time
6880217 being young soldiers you also had an air of cockiness about you and you felt invincible
6880218 but later i found out that this happened on a regular basis
6880219 you lived your normal life and did your job but you always looked over your shoulder wondering if you were being followed and you had to be careful what you said now as someone thats more stable in life i wonder how we lived through that but back then we loved what we were doing every soldier there was ready to do everything he could to preserve freedom
6880220 for the older georgians who remember the soviet domination i think theyre scared to death that its all going to come back
6880221 everything from communism to the social injustice and tyranny that marked that era it upsets me also because ive seen what its like for three years behind the wall and if you havent lived it you dont know what it is
6880222 regardless of who started the conflict between russia and georgia russia is taking their time to leave
6880223 if youve ever seen the dark shadow of old world communism before the wall fell its scary we had a saying when you went into east berlin you set your watch back 20 years they were that oppressed and a lot of them didnt even realize it
6880224 we had the opportunity to see how the other side lived and i actually enjoyed the experience i think it gives you a different outlook on life you dont take everything for granted and sometimes theres a price to be paid for things its a shame that we have to have it but when somebody threatens your lifestyle theres an opportunity to protect it
6880225 the prevalence of obesity has increased at an alarming level of at least 300 million people worldwide additionally other diseases like diabetes will increase in prevalence as well protection for this possible diabetes epidemic is needed the risk on increased bmi at young age caused by prenatal exposure to ocs like hcb has to be minimized therefore it is important that pregnant women are informed about the possible effects on prenatal exposure to hcb on the bmi of the child later in life
6880226 like a lot of teachers there now i figured how bad could it be i was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005
6880227 i became very very sick my immune system shut down i collapsed and was bedridden for several months
6880228 i wouldnt have kids in the school if i didnt think it was safe i would close the school
6880229 i do think there are areas of that school that continue to be dangerous
6880230 you can go most anyplace and build a school on top of a superfund site
6880231 they can build a school anywhere they want really and thats the sad truth i think at schools very little has changed and thats unfortunate
6880232 the children would actually pick up these chemicals and handle them
6880233 so for example one of these things was phosphorous rocks phosphorous rocks were little pieces of chemical residue that would bubble up to the surface the children would pick up these phosphorous rocks and when you threw them at a hard surface they would explode like a firecracker
6880234 i have a high school education i dont have a science degree but you dont have to be a scientist to know that 20 000 tons of chemicals and kindergartners dont mix

6880250 in the beginning of any media format a lot of content is oriented toward men

6880275 we had a great points weekend winning in michigan and we will carry the momentum into bristol and focus on gaining as many points on the series leader clint bowyer
6880276 crew chief todd lohse has a good handle on the setup you need to run well at a short track like bristol and with the toyota horsepower underneath us i think we have a good shot at being there at the end again this weekend
6880277 i went there as a fan in 2003 and watched the races there
6880278 thats all they could talk about was how they were sitting so close that they got debris in their beer cans

6880280 with the racing that we have there its pretty good racing there now with the three lanes but you dont see as much beating and banging for the one groove that we all had to fight for before because we can go anywhere now

6880284 even if speculation were found to be boosting the price it would be counterproductive to ban it futures and forward contracts are just bets that commodity prices will go up in the future if the bets are wrong then the speculator gets clobbered and prices go back down for consumers but if the speculator is right than even a temporary rise in prices sends us valuable signals about what is happening with a resource and any limit on speculation might lower prices in the present but not do anything to prevent their inevitable rise in the future
6880285 congress gave the phone companies immunity against the billions of dollars in lawsuits brought against them for cooperating with federal anti terror surveillance programs the aclu and some trial lawyers argue that this is unconstitutional but even law professors like howard wasserman who dont like the grant of immunity agree that it is constitutional indeed the legal arguments against immunity dont pass the straight face test although it is conceivable that a mischievous judge who has previously ruled in favor of telecom lawsuits and is angry at congress for curbing them will pretend to be convinced by them in order to allow such lawsuits to proceed
6880286 the authors go to great lengths to obscure their inability to credibly articulate human influence on the climate they do so through selectivity in research alarmist language failure to provide relevance or context to many of their claims and generally throughout with transparent advocacy in tone and content

6880289 we all can probably agree that we want tomorrows internet at the speed of light not at the speed of government a useful starting point is to appreciate that most customers have no real broadband today cable and dsl are a trickle compared to the niagara needed tomorrow freezing todays internet into a regulated public utility via net neutrality regulation as the fcc seems hell bent on doing would be the worst possible move slowing investment and innovation and resulting in fewer new companies products and technologies

6880523 we believe the long term investment case for russia is compelling

6880538 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
6880539 it is currently a violation of three separate federal laws to compel medical practitioners to perform a procedure that violates their conscience
6880540 any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience

6880547 republicans will think they have a very strong hand now theyre argument will be that nato wants it poland wants it the czech republic wants it so why dont the democrats want it

6880572 it was pride prides not good to a certain extent but these are the olympic games and ive trained long and hard for this im happy to be here today happy to be with my family
6880573 i think i would have made a statement with the judges here by refusing to fight again but in hindsight i believe the people back home deserved a bronze medal if anything not winning anything would have been worse
6880574 theres bad calls all the time and this is one of the times it happened to me
6880575 this has been going on for 20 or 30 years and every time it happens were told to be quiet and it will get better
6880576 it gets better every four years for about 10 seconds and then it happens again and when it happens to you youre told to shut up and not say anything because of what might happen to the sport
6880577 if this is truly what taekwondo is about maybe taekwondo shouldnt be an olympic sport maybe they should fix it and then let it come back
6880578 there is a concern that we will not survive as an olympic sport and that we must present a pristine environment of terrific scoring
6880579 we were manhandled we were threatened we participated in good faith we would expect the organization to provide us a level playing field and we dont think we were given a level playing field
6880580 they have the right to protest but in a peaceful manner
6880581 most of our energy and time was devoted to ensure fair judging especially in the olympic games
6880582 so far we think it is the fairest judges and refereeing our judges are doing their best
6880583 it showed human error whether it was intentional or not ill never know
6880584 but what i do know is that i showed the world that its about competition its about the human spirit and going out there and being the best you can be that is why i went out there and fought
6880585 the only thing that we can figure is that three of the referees sneezed at the same time or that they pushed their buttons to register a point on instinct
6880586 theyre nearsighted and shallow in seeing things as gold silver and bronze and instead of the hard work the dedication the sacrifice the miracle of what just transpired
6880587 sometimes we miss the little miracles and those of the big miracles of life

6880621 ive been told that im going as a defensive midfielder
6880622 i like that position a lot so im happy with that
6880623 i can play as a central defender as well and if the job needs to be done there then i can do that as well as anyone else and still bring something to the team
6880624 i do have a lot of experience and if it can help then of course but at first it helps myself because i have no impression here in the premier league
6880625 during his time here vince was unable to fulfill his or our expectations

6880683 i talked to nick about a couple of months ago and said if i manage to make the ryder cup team id love to bring both caddies

6880685 glen ive done very well with him and hes the one who is going to caddie for me at the ryder cup
6880686 but billy is almost the ryder cup itself he wouldnt be caddying for me but the atmosphere he brings to the team it feels like if hes not there theres going to be something missing
6880687 mcguffie and shaw are two guys that will not be redshirted theyll play
6880688 theyve done enough to convince us that they can contribute as freshmen and i think as much mentally as physically the biggest drawback for a freshman coming in is can they mentally handle the schemes and the pace all the things that go on with it those two have shown that they can
6880689 theyre both fast explosive players who i think are good with the spread system were excited about it as much as anything i like the way they practice freshmen come in and sometimes you have to teach them the intensity of practice these guys were obviously well coached in high school they were prepared well when they got here

6880703 my parents went to the 1984 olympics and all i got was this lousy t shirt
6880704 especially with the speed of the game and special formations
6880705 last year it was basically almost the same one formation the i set form now theres no telling where well line up we can do so much and its real good i love it because the defense doesnt know what to expect
6880706 a lot of people who run on all levels believe that
6880707 a lot of high school coaches have said they get more young guys out for it who have maybe never played a track guy or a basketball guy because they have a chance to get on the field
6880708 i really like it it gives a lot of athletes the opportunity to get the ball in space as an athlete thats what you really want
6880709 theres definitely going to be a vertical passing game especially with the pace of our offense sometimes the defense isnt getting the signals and we just run right by them were so open
6880710 the michigan offense never seemed to show the same formation on back to back plays there were two tailbacks in the backfield an empty backfield wide receivers motioning into an empty backfield to become tailbacks slotbacks turning into quarterbacks quarterbacks turning into wide receivers tight ends lining up in the slot and so forth there were more looks on display in 15 minutes than an entire season under the previous coaching regime
6880711 comparing coach rod to yost is not rational this team will not be stronger faster smarter and more determined than the rest of their opponents

6880713 there was nothing absolutely nothing wrong with the u m program while lloyd carr was running it
6880714 but that said the insinuation was that rrs style is so refreshing and lloyds style was so neanderthal ish
6880715 if all was right with u m football why is carr no longer there
6880716 but youre not being honest if you believe hes run a 1 2 3 kick offense
6880717 ive watched many time when they were pounding a team with a great mix of pass amp run and then perhaps stalled or had a turnover and gave it up only to hold the other team to 3 amp out then come back with 3 straight pass plays and then forced to punt it back no runs in the series or anything just 3 passes
6880718 if all was right with um football why is carr no longer there
6880719 if carr had won two or three of his critical losses we wouldnt be having this conversation
6880720 the sports world is full of fans that never so much as slid the helmet down over their ears and buckled their chinstrap that have all the answers
6880721 if all was right with um football why is carr no longer there
6880722 if im interpreting your posts correctly only fans who have played or coached the game are qualified to have an opinion
6880723 unfortunately you do have to count me as someone who hasnt played or coached any sport above the high school level
6880724 i think its a kind of arrogance that so many fans think they know more than people who have been playing and or coaching the game for most of their adult lives

6880730 oh by the way uminks shaw is a wide receiver wearing number 20
6880731 and you should know with college numbers that isnt indicative of their position with is lopatta wearing 84 and remember who had 20 prior to hart ian gold a lb
6880732 glowes thoughts mr lowe you just blew the lid off the situation hopefully many regular posters reads your comments manningham had very good quickness not great but could body up on a cb and was nearly always open matthews does a good job of this although decidedly slower probably runs a true 4 65 4 7 as did marquise walker from a few years ago and also arrington last year who actually wasnt able to do this his first couple years but worked on it and learned how stonum is the straight line speed guy that you were referring to that doesnt have a clue about how to get open at this point and will have to rely on blowing by a cb to get open he has to learn how to work harder or he wont be much help anytime soon roundtree although slight of build intrigues me as he has some wiggle and good stop and start quicks i didnt get to watch him on the jugs machine enough to see if he had the soft natural hands that you want you were mentioning harvin amp ginn but actually they arent really comparable athletes although both have similar results which is standing in the end zone at the end of a play harvin is that great peter warrick type guy that puts fear in a defense because he can hurt you from so many different alignments on the field and ginn is the guy that has cbs stumbling off the line of scrimmage as they know one misstep and hes long gone for 6 that they make many unforced errors as they say just from an intimidation standpoint i watched experienced nfl cbs do crazy things in the dolphins camp last august because that saw that raw speed that can kill you if you make that one crucial misstep and let him behind you with a guy like that and hopefully stonum can become a little like this you want to jam his butt at the l o s and not let him get in his route force him to alter or break it off however if you go for the jam and he gets a juke on you and slips it bye bye the yac will be very crucial in this offense as so many plays will be the quick bubble type screens and short outs amp ins etc that rely on the athletes doing their thing i think in the long run odoms will excell in this type set up clemons is a different type guy altogether i wanted to mention to you also when you talked harvin at fla for years at fla when spurrier was there u f had good wrs but never a great one my measuring stick being the nfl draft the key was spurrier had a wr coach named dwayne dixon and im not sure where he is coaching right now that i considered to be among the very best in college ball i used to go to gainesville and watch the drills he put his wrs through to teach them its not all about speed but thinking and using your smarts and your body to get open if you chart the wr production at fla for those spurrier years versus where the wrs ended up meaning not many are still playing pro ball other than darrell jackson who still doesnt have any speed but gets open and makes plays its an amazing record u m had a very young coach that started as a wr coach back in the mid to late 80s before moving to qb coach named cam cameron he worked very hard with a gifted but unproductive up to that point wr named greg mcmurtry and turned into a nfl caliber guy as well as derrick alexander amani toomer and another guy named chris callaway callaway played 8 10 years in the nfl with a minimal amount of skills but sure hands tremendous blocking skills a great work ethic and most of all the ability to use his body amp his smarts to get open nearly every play alexander had a lot more tools than the others but was raw and didnt know how to use those tools toomer was pretty much the same way as alexander were talking about some guys that all played between 6 10 years in the league except mcmurtry who may have opted for pro baseball after a brief stnt in an nfl camp i cant remember and i believe toomers been in about a dozen years with a modicum of talent rr and barwis have shown that something was awry up there because it was the constant talk of the nfl how many struggled with the transition due to lack of strength and techniques and as much as the current players are trying to downplay the old s amp c coach they know themselves its night and day i can see a couple players blossoming under barwis but to see the majority of the players comment on how stronger faster better conditioned they are is a joke im not sure how much it will translate onto the field but with the strides will johnson has made is incredible benching 580lbs is unheard of now hopefully he adds some techniques to make it hard for the ol to block him to have morgan trent say he has added 10lbs of muscle but is quicker faster than he has ever been i honestly believer he has transformed himself into a atleast a 3rd round corner gee toomer is the giants all time leading receiver whatever happened to kolesar there was this skinny guy i used to play im ball with named a carter 5 11

6880850 on april 11 1945 the village hottelstedt was the point of departure of the patrol of combat team 9 6th armored division u s third army which discovered the concentration camp of buchenwald
6880851 i hope that this american heros family reads these comments and knows that his sacrifice has touched people around the country and around the world in an age of hubris and ego of warfare and terrorism this humble man truly exemplifies what i would like to think being an american really stands for
6880852 people like mr hoyt are real heroes and truly show the goodness that humans are capable of this modest quiet man is now sitting at the right hand of god and he will hold that place of honor for eternity
6880853 im the last living of the first four american soldiers who liberated buchenwald concentration camp
6880854 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
6880855 im not saying my dad was a hero to every person in the world but im saying he certainly had a heroic approach and outlook and definitely went above and beyond a persons call of duty to understand the atrocities of war
6880856 they say alls fair in love and war well some of these things werent so fair especially if you were a member of an ethnic group or cultural group that didnt suit the people of power you were scheduled to be obliterated and thats not ok thats not what democracy and freedom is all about
6880857 besides all of the horror and disbelief and shocking things that come out of war there are also the caring human sides and moral aspects of what we need to learn why do we fight this hard in war and put ourselves and others through it if we dont learn from it
6880858 but perhaps more than this lack of leverage the main reason why manilas call for burmese democratization fell on deaf ears is the fact that the philippines under arroyo lacks the integrity and the moral ascendancy to preach about human rights and democracy
6880859 real lesson proved by these six party talks that you can get bullies like bush to act nice to you if you have nukes and it makes perfect sense high school bad boys wont bully a guy carrying a baseball bat would they
6880860 and the last thing the world would want is a group of extremists taking over control of a nuclear power
6880861 quezon proposed a sprawling settlement in mindanao that could cater to 30 000 to a million jews they also were offered naturalization and philippine citizenship among other benefits the idea was almost too good to be true
6880862 we should get over the idea that sex is solely for pro creation thats bullshit sex is for pleasure we are humans not robots we should not be reduced to producing offsprings
6880863 i can say theres nothing wrong with scrapping the deal and upsetting beiijing if only to promote philippine interests in the region but before manila do that she must first make sure that she would have the asean to back her up once china explodes in anger thats because the philippines alone could never handle chinas wrath the philippines needs to stick with the asean and urge the bloc to face chinese threat as a united group this has consistently worked in the past
6880864 in my opinion lee should continue this hardline policy undeterred it would put more pressure on the north koreans to make progress with the agreements made in the six party talks this policy would have better chances of succeeding where the sunshine policy failed making the north behave better as a member of the international community
6880865 should japan overhaul its criminal justice system and the powers of its police and adopt mechanism that would ensure the protection of the rights of the accused certainly
6880866 how come they are very vocal on homosexuality but not on the rampant corruption and violations of human rights under the arroyo regime
6880867 the mtrcb suggests that viewers are generally so horny that they would be reduced to rapists the moment they see this scene i think this is preposterous
6880868 which leads me now to one basic question why then is the ruling junta not postponing this weeks referendum on the military backed constitution which requires precious money that would be better spent for the victims relief
6880869 nevermind basic science i just cant for the life of me see how more choices for women devalue their lives or how the use of contraceptives leads to abortion i mean duh if you resort to contraceptive you prevent pregnancy if theres no pregnancy theres no abortion is it just me or are these bishops really making an ass of themselves
6880870 but in engaging the milf the united states i believe is playing with fire it is building a very dangerous alliance that if left uncontrolled could bring the americans an even bigger problem instead of benefits look at the cases of the taliban pakistan and al qaeda and youll get what i mean

6880875 we congratulate hong kong for their repeated success in winning the worlds best airport title
6880876 in recent years the whole air travel experience has become much more focussed on the time customers spend in the airport environment and hong kong has established itself as a clear passenger favourite in this respect
6880877 the world airport survey evaluates a broad spectrum of product and service touchpoints across the airport experience covering a wide spectrum of passenger types hong kong was particularly notable for gaining highest satisfaction ratings in such a diverse market like any other business an airport is striving to deliver world class standards that will make a customer want to use it again and achieving this level of loyalty requires the highest levels of quality consistency something where hong kong was singled out again and again during the survey
6880878 over the last 10 years the skytrax world airport awards have become recognised as the trusted global symbol of quality for airports
6880879 our survey participants represent the most experienced diverse and discerning travellers in the marketplace and airports throughout the world recognize the inherent value that comes with their endorsement
6880880 we again saw a very tight finish to this 2007 8 passenger survey with very close margins seen between the worlds top 3 airports the opening of the new terminal 3 at singapore changi was clearly visible from results during the survey with customer satisfaction levels showing marked increases for this airport over the period it was included we have yet to see what impact the new concourse terminal will have upon passenger ratings for seoul incheon airport with this being too late to have any impact on these 2008 results
6880881 i dont know who gave this tag fab four they have done so much for indian cricket over the last fifteen years agreed they failed in this test series but it happens in cricket we should not forget their contribution in the past

6880899 phantoms items such made up in advance for both teams in the playoffs or world series so that no matter who wins souvenirs are ready to be sold
6880900 phantoms are funny as they seem to increase and decrease in value for no particular reason said dave stark of www
6880901 some have more value than others but for the most part i would estimate value in a general sense 10 20
6880902 but we were only going 6 mph so it was all in fun
6880903 if your car qualifies in the top four thats a really good thing
6880904 but when you pick around 25th you can pick the stall around some people who have struggled a bit and might get a lap down or might not be around at the end of the night

6880906 you used to have one groove out there but now there are several grooves so you can race a little harder all night

6880908 i get excited about coming here no matter where we are in the points
6880909 i just hope those guys race me cleaner saturday night than you guys did today at the go kart track
6880910 history is full of courageous leaders who in their private lives were terrible and abusive spouses and parents depressives drunks bullies individuals have a way of partitioning their lives handling one set of duties commendably and another abysmally
6880911 our selfishness our focus on our own short term needs
6880912 i dont think people are interested in what i had for lunch
6880913 people generally do not read an op ed written by an mc member of congress and then look at the advertisement for viagra next to it and assume that the mc therefore endorses viagra or that viagra endorses them
6880914 i break the rules every day when i send a qik or a twitter or post on a blog
6880915 in fact as soon as we hang up im going to commit an illegal act and i will send out a twitter post
6880916 im not an expert interviewer i realized i talked too much
6880917 first the only item we seek to address is loosening existing rules to allow members to post videos as a first step toward making the rules meet our constituents expectations regarding how they communicate with us in the 21st century
6880918 they have not updated the franking regulation for the 21st century with the emergence of new technology
6880919 as long as its official then we shouldnt have overarching restrictions
6880920 i dont see them disarming themselves when those rules would not be imposed on their challengers
6880921 tell me where i can and cannot communicate with my constituents and with the american people
6880922 in my opinion the ability to use the internet videos instant messaging etc to reach constituents and make government more accessible outweighs the potential for conflict of interest in this case
6880923 as democrats in the state of illinois if you lose you rally around the person who won

6880925 this was really maybe his launching pad so to speak
6880926 i dont oppose all wars what i am opposed to is a dumb war
6880927 and just as soon as he opened the door you could just see the charisma and the energy that he had
6880928 this is my little brother seamus and hes about to go to iraq
6880929 i want you to know when i become elected if theres anything i can do i want to be there to support you
6880930 youve got to have your mind 100 percent right to be going through something like this
6880931 my parents shared not only an improbable love they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation
6880932 a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that america has a place for him too
6880933 and john kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes
6880934 you know a while back i met a young man named seamus in a vfw hall in east moline illinois
6880935 i thought of the 900 men and women sons and daughters husbands and wives friends and neighbors who wont be returning to their own hometowns i thought of the families ive met who were struggling to get by without a loved ones full income or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered but who still lacked long term health benefits because they were reservists when we send our young men and women into harms way we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why theyre going to care for their families while theyre gone to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war secure the peace and earn the respect of the world
6880936 i couldnt believe it it was something that i wasnt prepared for
6880937 he had a cigar in his mouth and said you really like this liberal

6881159 with an approximate fair market value of us 6 4 million for the transaction we estimate that at 800 ounce of gold and an initial production rate of 50 000 ounce of gold per year from the oxide mine only gryphon gold would recover the cost of reducing the royalty in just over 5 years

6881169 leaving bottled water out in the car changes the chemical equilibrium so that the materials from the plastic go into the water faster
6881170 adding boiling water to polycarbonate plastic bottles causes a dramatic spike 55 times as much in the amount of bisphenol a or bpa leaching from containers into drinks according to a u s research team the finding suggests that parents sterilizing polycarbonate baby bottles by heating them in water or in a microwave may be inadvertently increasing the amount of the estrogen mimicking chemical leaching from the containers it also indicates hikers who use the bottles as a thermos to store hot tea or liquids may be doing the same
6881171 i tell parents that if they choose bottled water without fluoride theyre losing an opportunity to protect their childs teeth we know fluoride has a great track record in diminishing the risk of decay

6881189 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6881190 my testimony will show that jenny has been stalking me because i broke up with her that she refuses to accept the breakup it all started just before november i didnt wish to date someone who didnt respect my need for space i made it very clear that i no longer wished to date her she objected i told her she shouldnt hint about marriage with a guy the way she had been doing with me over the past six months she tried to tell me we made those plans together but that is incorrect i never promised to marry her or said that i planned to marry her in the future she is making that up sure there was a time when i wished to marry her some day but that never became an actual engagement
6881191 over the next few days she tried calling me to persuade me to go back to her but i had made my decision and stuck to it you see that even after a breakup she still did not give me space i made it very clear that the relationship was over but she didnt stop there she disrespected me i soon received this letter
6881192 you see how she guilt tripped me tried to make me feel bad for doing what i had to do you see she insisted the marriage talk was not hers alone although she knew this wasnt true i sent her a letter saying what i had to say
6881193 this still was not enough for her i received this e mail a few days later
6881194 more of the same i simply replied no no more was necessary i could not be her friend if this was how she would treat me at every opportunity
6881195 she sicced her best friend astrid on me astrid yelled at me and embarrassed me in front of the whole cafeteria calling me a jerk astrid apparently told jenny i called her repressed and that i was a con man because i soon got this next e mail
6881196 i did not even bother answering such a low hateful e mail next if i asked a girl out she said yes but then broke the date i could get no one
6881197 i dont know how jenny found out about each date so i figure she had spies
6881198 she was up to all this i wouldnt be surprised if she threatened my dates who only gave me bogus excuses for breaking our dates i began to fear for my safety jenny may be small but with a knife or a gun she could be truly dangerous
6881199 then she dared to show her face at the lighthouse not wanting to give me a moments peace
6881200 about her because shes a christian no one i am not spreading rumors and two i say what i say to warn people precisely because it is true
6881201 just before thanksgiving break i found a girl online babette who agreed to go out with me
6881202 one day to my shock and indignation jenny entered an online chat room where we were
6881203 babette defended me of course though it wasnt necessary she knows the truth i told her everything jenny finally realized she was beaten and fled the chat room she tried several times to join us there after that but we always made her leave
6881204 she even accused me of libel and slander as you say but this is not the case it is only libel and slander if what you say is not true she knows what i say is true this truth is proven by these letters and e mails i have shown and read to you
6881205 babette tried to defend me again and understandably sent jenny a letter telling her to leave me alone jenny for some strange reason showed this letter to the dean of students youd think that would be too embarrassing for her even more incredible she accused babette of stalking you know what they say about the pot calling the kettle black the dean having been warned about jenny knew better than to let her manipulate him into taking action against my girlfriend whod done nothing wrong or illegal
6881206 jenny even became physically violent driving him to threaten to call security this scared her into fleeing and now we are here
6881207 if this is what you really think of me scott if this is how you really see things then no wonder you call me a stalker if it isnt then you are a scoundrel
6881208 i never had any idea that he was asking people out
6881209 i would never ever get violent with him or anyone else and im too afraid to even hold a sharp knife or gun
6881210 what he says about me he says its true but its not this babette is a jerk not sweet and understanding me id go into chat rooms to talk with other people online
6881211 and i never got violent with mr brown he was biased against me ready to color whatever he saw me do and believe the worst about me because scott had already gotten to him and told him lies about me he and scott are weed buddies if mr brown had known me better he wouldnt have believed scott so easily that is my story
6881212 jenny had no spies out im not aware of any one of her friends trying to tell girls not to date scott if they did that was their own idea not jennys those girls probably just heard about the situation from the campus rumor mill and didnt want to get in the middle of it that one girl who got warned probably talked to someone who knew what had really happened but it wasnt jenny the girls probably went to dinner told their friends about the date and then heard all the awful details the rumor mill had come up with those dates were sacrificed to gossip not to jenny
6881213 hmmm always picked last i am different this time it will be not
6881214 this is by far the best film in the more recent trilogy and also the best of the four episodes mr lucas has directed thats right its better than star wars
6881215 e asily the best of the trio of star wars prequels its not just in warfare that revenges visuals excel the film is frankly overwhelming in its ability to create a spectacular variety of alternate worlds

6881245 john mccain flunked the easiest quiz of the campaign by losing count of how many homes he owns and reaffirming his belief that the fundamentals of our economy are sound
6881246 no wonder he continues to offer more of the same disastrous economic policies that weve seen for the last eight years americans working families simply cannot afford more of the same failed and out of touch economic agenda
6881247 what sets us apart from the competition is our focus on tracking the entire customer transaction lifecycle first visit to coupon distribution coupon redemption to future visits
6881248 the report issued today by americans for smart natural catastrophe policy makes erroneous assumptions misreads the specific aspects of pending legislation and comes to conclusions that are designed to serve the needs of the interests that fund this organization and not the american taxpayer
6881249 while the consultants who prepared the report would like readers to believe that the status quo of demanding ever higher insurance rates and hoping for the best is the solution to the concerns of the 6 in 10 american families that live in areas vulnerable to massive hurricanes and earthquakes that system like their report is fundamentally flawed
6881250 the house of representatives by an overwhelming 258 155 margin considered this kind of rhetorical gimmickry saw it for what it was and in a bipartisan show of support for american taxpayers and families approved the national catastrophe fund legislation hr 3355
6881251 hr 3355 is an integrated solution that creates a partnership between primary insurers reinsurers state governments and the national government it will increase capacity eliminate subsidies in the current system and offer coverage at lower costs to consumers than todays system
6881252 the capital numbers overstate the capacity of global reinsurers because most of the equity capital is committed to support coverage in high frequency lines of business
6881253 im just a poor railroader ive got a small house and a family im trying to raise

6881255 i am hugely excited to have got the job my first priority will be to work with the venue design team as our sport is unique in having four legged athletes as well as two legged ones training on site some venues will just be used for two or three days with athletes training elsewhere but at greenwich the venue is the sport and the sport is the venue
6881256 sue benson was here and is pleased that in greenwich her course will be able to be more open less twisty and longer a 10 or 11 minute course rather than the 8 minute one that for obvious reasons they had here

6881288 actually by this point of the ps2s life cycle games like final fantasy x devil may cry grand theft auto iii kingdom hearts metal gear solid 2 etc had come out

6881294 regulators are bracing for well over 100 bank failures in the next 12 to 24 months with concentrations in rust belt states like michigan and ohio and the states that are suffering severe housing market problems like california florida and georgia
6881295 while cobol coders still remain in the workplace their numbers are diminishing
6881296 thats what we try to do from the mechanics upwards if a mechanic sticks a tyre on and someone comes along and says it could be done better its not an insult its because we are always striving for improvement for those one per cent gains in absolutely every single thing we do
6881297 now its my belief that some guys dont do that that they rely on doping instead and they neglect all the little bits i suspect some look on doping as a substitute for training properly
6881298 the italian cycling federation president said something about our track programme being doped people do say things like that and it really doesnt bother me i can sleep with a clear conscience
6881299 if youre open and frank about it and youre not pussyfooting around then whats the big deal look lifes pretty straightforward in my view you can tell from the way people talk if theyre hiding something they come up with far fetched excuses but look in their eyes people dont want to talk about it because theyre frightened theyll get caught
6881300 people say doping is this big door you come to it and then decide whether you want to walk through it or not
6881301 but its not like that what often happens with doping is that you get yourself in a right mess you get yourself in a real situation and it doesnt seem like theres any other way out
6881302 i had quite a bad but very interesting experience with dave millar im pretty close to him hes been very open with me and i chose to stand by him and try and support him because i realised that hed found himself in what he felt was a pretty desperate situation
6881303 it gave me an insight an invaluable insight it made me even more convinced that doping is a crutch nothing more and it made me even more convinced that we can win without doping
6881304 i dont think well be able to tell for another couple of years but i do think like dave brailsford that doping can be a shortcut for some athletes
6881305 i tell you something that as the mother of an athlete i find really upsetting its that i know when chris is standing on the podium getting a medal there are people looking at him thinking i wonder if hes taken something that suspicion is horrible im proud of how vocal hes been about it and i dont have any doubts about him because hes always known the difference between right and wrong he knew as a child that if he stole the last biscuit then jiminy cricket would get him
6881306 i dont actually blame people for being suspicious because its what theyre told in the media that top athletes take drugs
6881307 there are guys i know who are still racing who would probably bet their entire lifes earnings on the fact that i take drugs because they will not accept that i could be beating them without taking drugs it would shatter their ego all their beliefs it would destroy them
6881308 im sure there are even some guys who wouldnt feel resentment towards you if you told them oh im taking this or that the reaction from them wouldnt be you cheating bastard it would be right ok thanks for the advice im less and less aware of that doping culture though
6881309 there are about two or three left in the world of sprinting ten years ago i would have said there were maybe a dozen or so but i would agree with dave brailsford i think some guys maybe do see drugs as the biggest part of their preparation with the result that they dont pay as much attention to every other detail trying to squeeze everything out of every other area but thats what motivates me to put in 100 per cent every day i try to go into the major competitions knowing that ive done absolutely everything i possibly could
6881310 i think we have to learn a lot more on a human level a psychological level about why athletes dope
6881311 when i was preparing my presentation for the conference and thinking of that key question why did i dope i got to thinking why did i not dope for so long i think its useful to look at what factors might prevent an individual doping it comes down to their core values ideals ethics but also their peer group and their belief in the system if you dont believe in that system if you think youre being let down by it if you know that other people around you are doping and you know theyre getting away with it then you start to lose faith in the system
6881312 it would require so much deception and living a lie
6881313 htc would not release a smartphone in this day and age that lacked bluetooth support
6881314 it will be 10 times the size of the super bowl
6881315 the scale of this network is so large that instead of laying stuff down on the ground we put it underground and are bringing it up to where its needed
6881316 the equipment that were installing basically looks like a wi fi network thats geared for cellular coverage
6881317 what happens is that wireless operators will put in base stations on site and from those base stations we will transport their signals from various parts of the buildings through antenna points
6881318 its 6 000 kids that come back that have sometimes as much as 5 000 in their pocket from saving things up and they spend a good bit of it on back to school stuff and then throughout the year they keep our restaurants full and do an awful lot of additional buying
6881319 this is helping us to bridge a gap we lost more than 200 000 to those cuts this year and so what this is doing is helping us to remain fully staffed its helping us to keep our doors open so when someone is in danger they know where to come and they can come our doors wont be closed because we dont have enough money to keep staff here 24 hours a day
6881320 when we have to begin to take a spectrum thats already crowded and now overlay all new services on top of that that is the big unknown
6881321 the wireless side is the biggest deal because theres no script you could read from
6881322 tell me and i forget show me and i remember involve me and i
6881323 kids are coming into the district from feeder schools way below grade
6881324 when i grow up i want to be on the short end of microhoo
6881325 it is seen as a status symbol an aspirational product so you can expect to see not just the rich but also tech savvy youngsters and people in small towns buying it
6881326 the first 18 20 months all we were doing was trying to get individual behaviors to match our discipline our philosophy our work ethic
6881327 were out of the learning stage were in the performance stage we have to execute now its time to grow up we have a good number of guys who have played a lot for us
6881328 this team now today is 100 times different than it was in the past
6881329 what we do how we present ourselves on campus how we act on campus how we are in the surrounding neighborhoods with community service all the things we do are what coach golden has brought to this team and im really honored to be part of it
6881330 now that weve gotten all the bad stuff out its football football football its a real camp now guys are getting banged up this is what we should have been doing back in the past it was never like that i dont know if it was the coaching or what but from past stories guys werent even going to practice things like that they were going out for no reason now that we want to win we want to practice we want to do the right things

6881334 uniforms do reach a point where you can only wear them so many seasons
6881335 we had a good spring practice and good practices this year i think were in a good place so far this year
6881336 we have a lot of new people and were trying to find out whos going to play where we have a great group of girls and its been very competitive in drills and practice
6881337 last year when we scored we won were trying to include more offensive plays
6881338 i want to go out on top and win the conference this year i tell the younger players that this might be their only chance last year the 5 0 loss in the semi finals to wheeling jesuit wasnt the prettiest of ends
6881339 were going to be hungrier we have nine returnees on a squad of 25
6881340 we have 11 positions open but we have the attitude that everyone is helping each other its pushing us to work harder
6881341 our first two games are against tough teams northern kentucky and east stroudsburg i think davis amp elkins charleston and west virginia wesleyan all look to be tough in conference we have a good bunch of girls and their attitude has been really great i dont believe that were rebuilding we have 12 freshmen who can step in to roles as needed

6881403 after eight years at the side of president clinton and seven years representing new york in the u s senate she is clear eyed both about the demands of the globes toughest job and about using the power that comes with it she would try to lead by doing
6881404 her celebrity status notwithstanding clinton is at heart a worker in the trenches she has an encyclopedic knowledge of the issues and her success in the senate on behalf of new yorkers attests to both relentless attention to detail and skill at working the levers of power
6881405 i am concerned that the department of defenses bigger is better mentality poses substantial costs to tax payers without clearly defined benefits to the warfighter
6881406 nevertheless if dod proceeds with a request for proposal that favors a large tanker it must provide adequate time for competitors to offer bids
6881407 the original competition included numerous delays to accommodate the bidders proposals dod should not attempt to rush the completion of this award after substantially changing the way it will score the proposals this contract is too big and too important to sole source there must be a full and fair competition which should include a reasonable amount of time for the competitors to offer their proposals
6881408 as a result of this contraction in north america north americas share of the cdma market fell to an approximately two thirds share from an over three quarters share in the second quarter last year growth in asia pacific particularly in india helped to offset these declines
6881409 however we believe the region will experience declines in the second half of the year as we expect operators in the asia pacific to begin to focus more capital toward their gsm networks
6881410 the increased support for lte from incumbent cdma operators does not imply the imminent death of ev do rev a and b because lte is addressing different market needs than 3g third generation wireless
6881411 hspa will contest with lte and mobile wimax in the mobile broadband space

6881413 violence drugs and crime tear communities apart and we need to provide law enforcement with all the tools necessary to fight this epidemic
6881414 those affected by these crimes need to feel safe in their homes and communities this funding is a step toward putting an end to these violent offenses
6881415 this funding will help allow the south dakota department of health to continue training programs to ensure the people of our state are getting the best level of care
6881416 a key part of my hometown prosperity plan is investing in the public good and this funding is a wonderful example of an investment that will help south dakotans
6881417 i am proud to secure this funding for delta dental which will allow south dakotans throughout the state get the quality dental care they need
6881418 care mobile has been a great resource for the people in our state and these resources will allow them to continue providing these services in the coming year
6881419 i will continue to work through my seat on the appropriations committee to provide south dakota citizens with the resources they need to improve rural health care our state a key part of my hometown prosperity plan is investing in the public good and this funding is a great example of that kind of investment
6881420 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6881421 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6881422 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6881423 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6881424 a diner in the morning a hoagie in the afternoon a bar at night
6881425 i try to never underestimate any of my opponents but theres really nothing that worries me too much with brock lesnar i know it could be a tough fight but you know i train hard and i will be ready for this one too
6881426 his was my seventh ufc fight i have never been completely dominated by an opponent in a ufc fight even in my 2 losses which were by split decision i won five fights among which three were by ko tko so im asking how many fights do i have to win to definitely give me the credibility to get a title shot
6881427 you had people here who didnt want to leave but after a few days of being stranded they were saying ok its time to go
6881428 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6881429 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6881430 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6881431 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6881432 virtual schools are growing so quickly that a good count of them remains elusive
6881433 digital revolution w e are on the threshold of the most radical change in american education in over a century here with the web is the way for america to use the marvels it created to end the regression in our competitive and academic performance
6881434 legislature passed senate bill no 975 authorizing the texas education agency to invite interested schools to submit an application to join the virtual school pilot program aimed at benefiting at risk students
6881435 a strength of the southwest preparatory application was our schools strong history of working with at risk students
6881436 not make the kid fit the system but the system fit the kid
6881437 read background material engage in discussions with other students take test ask questions of his teacher and hands in assignments
6881438 the olo student body consists of a mix of kids who have turned to elearning for a variety of reasons
6881439 for a student to be successful in the virtual school system they have to be highly motivated self starting intelligent people
6881440 the virtual schools that are in wisconsin do a good job of marketing their product
6881441 there are pros and cons to any system the cons to virtual schools is we teach kids life skills as part of a curriculum im not sure you can get that sitting in front of a computer
6881442 core curriculum is based on wisconsins approved high school curriculum the core courses of english math science social studies and physical education meet the requirements of wisconsins department of public instruction
6881443 the wisconsin education association council thinks parents are taking the place of teachers in virtual schools a violation of state law that requires all public school teachers to have a valid teaching license
6881444 we cannot assume that our schools will naturally drift toward using technology effectively we must commit to staying the course and making the changes necessary to reach our goals of educating every child together we can use technology to ensure that no child is left behind

6881453 the typical 8 18 year old lives in a home with 3 6 cd or tape players 3 5 tvs 3 3 radios 2 9 vcrs dvd players 2 1 video game consoles and 1 5 computers
6881454 in 1965 gordon moore predicted that the capacity of a computer chip will double every 18 months
6881455 it should support student performance of an authentic task and it should be integrated in activities that are a core part of the classroom curriculum
6881456 the best way to predict the future is to invent it
6881457 those who say it cant be done should get out of the way of those who are doing it
6881458 it is not a question of having technology or not having technology but rather what role it is allowed to play in human activities
6881459 the first to grow up surrounded by digital media computers are everywhere in the home school factory and office as are digital technologies cameras video games and cd roms todays kids are so bathed in bits that they think technology is part of the natural landscape
6881460 if we teach today as we taught yesterday we rob our children of tomorrow
6881461 computers are placed on small carts or desks with wheels so they can be moved to the area of need one strategy is to set up different workstations for students to use when working on a project access to a computer with an internet connection or cd rom capabilities may be one workstation and other resources can be available at other workstations students can rotate from one workstation to the next another strategy is for students who are using the computer to gather material they can print out the material and read it at a later time instead of trying to read it online
6881462 the carnegie commission on higher education concluded that technology should be the servant and not the master of instruction
6881463 due to the ever changing nature of technology effective teachers must realize that planning creating and modification of lesson plans and activities is a continuous process
6881464 inappropriately used in the classroom technology can be used to perpetuate old models of teaching and learning
6881465 learning does not take place better or faster simply by replacing one instructional medium with another
6881466 the shift of school from place to activity is a necessary transformation if our educational institutions are to be relevant in the lives of learners
6881467 research indicates that a childs success in school is significantly influenced by having a high degree of parental involvement
6881468 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6881469 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6881470 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6881471 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6881472 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6881473 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6881474 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6881475 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6881476 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6881477 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6881478 if you trust every web site but not a government
6881479 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6881480 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6881481 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6881482 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6881483 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6881484 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6881485 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6881486 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition

6881947 it might sound strange to say that joy is the result of our choices we often imagine that some people are luckier than others and that their joy or sorrow depends on the circumstances of their life over which they have no control however we do have a choice not so much in regard to the circumstances of our life but in regard to the way we respond to these circumstances two people can be the victim of the same accident for the one it becomes the source of resentment for the other the source of gratitude the external circumstances are the same but the choice of response is completely different some people become bitter as they grow old others grow old joyfully that does not mean that the life of those who became bitter was harder than the life of those who become joyful it means that different choices were made inner choices of the heart it is important to become aware that at every moment of our life we have an opportunity to choose joy life has many sides to it there are always sorrowful and joyful sides to the reality we live and so we always have a choice to live the moment as a cause for resentment or as a cause for you it is in the choice that our true freedom lies and that freedom is in the final analysis the freedom to love it might be a good idea to ask ourselves how we develop our capacity to choose for joy maybe we could spend a moment at the end of each day and decide to remember that day whatever may have happened as a day to be grateful for in so doing we increase our hearts capacity to choose for joy and as our hearts become more joyful we will become without any special effort a source of joy for others just as sadness begets sadness so joy begets joy

6881953 i like driving this track it is different to other street circuits we have known yesterday when i walked the track i thought it would be fun and today confirmed that impression there are some very quick parts and almost everywhere theres a lot of room maybe similar to some of the north american circuits used in the past they have really done a good job today our weekend got off to a good start but obviously it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition overtaking it will be difficult as always i hope i dont need to by getting the best position in qualifying the set up we have found today is not bad but there is still plenty of room for improvement
6881954 they were two enjoyable sessions with the lap times tumbling bit by bit as the drivers lapped and got confidence in the track layout the track surface is still very dirty and it is easy to make mistakes which can lose you precious tenths and to do a good lap time you have to be perfect i like the track theres a nice atmosphere and i have to say the organizers have done a good job today it was important that we find a good base set up immediately and we managed to do that
6881955 it was a good day we worked well and acquired a lot of data from this track which over the next few hours will be used to prepare ourselves as well as possible for this weekend from what we could see given the usual unknowns on a friday we can say we are competitive whether we will be competitive enough to reach our target will only be revealed starting with tomorrow afternoons qualifying

6882101 i havent even heard about it i dont ever pay attention to that stuff shes one of my best friends in the whole wide world and honestly when youre sitting in a room for three hours doing satellite interviews we were staring at a post it note with a smiley face so i think i probably rolled my eyes a hundred times im like oh gosh this thing is still going on
6882102 were going to have to have a permanent presence both in terms of our long term planning through the commission and then the office
6882103 it seems to me that when it comes to taking notes writing reports and applying for grants that we should have a whole houseful of experts on that in state government
6882104 i think we could be spending that 3 million to help the people of eastern iowa rebuild
6882105 this is a good investment from the state of iowa

6882115 in the beginning of any media format a lot of content is oriented toward men
6882116 as more content is created for the female market women become dominant and drive most of the ad dollars
6882117 we think of segments of individuals who share certain attitudes and needs
6882118 women will often follow because they want to keep a family plan

6882417 newman repeatedly made it clear that he wanted to be buried next to his life long partner ambrose st john no one gave the pope permission to defy newmans wishes
6882418 the re burial has only one aim in mind to cover up newmans homosexuality and to disavow his love for another man it is an act of shameless dishonesty and personal betrayal by the gay hating catholic church
6882419 i have ever thought no bereavement was equal to that of a husbands or wifes but i feel it difficult to believe that any can be greater or anyones sorrow greater than mine
6882420 i wish with all my heart to be buried in fr ambrose st johns grave and i give this my last my imperative will

6882446 when my wife became ill fr eddie asked her to attend some prayer evenings at the presbytery
6882447 i didnt realise until shed been to a couple that they were actually more a kind of pagan gathering i think it was after the third or fourth one she asked me if she could take him
6882448 she told me that fr eddie had told her that because clive was her son hed amplify her natural energies accelerate her healing clive said hed be glad to go he was completely devoted to his mother and i thought no more about it
6882449 the boy was a bit reserved after some of the meetings but hes a teenager i passed it off as adolescence my wife admitted to me that there was a sexual element to some of the ceremonies they performed and that perhaps this was stirring up some hormonal issues for clive i told her i didnt want him witnessing anything inappropriate but she laughed and told me it was more imagery and suggestion than anything else so i said no more about it i never thought for a moment shed allow anything harmful to happen to our son

6882476 a remarkably accurate adaptation of thackerays novel about the rise and fall of a duplicitous irishman in eighteenth century england but by simply changing the point of view turning the heros firstperson narration into a seemingly omniscient though subtly fallible third person voice over kubrick transformed a picaresque into a heartbreakingly ironic meditation on destiny

6882489 he spent the first half of this decade cutting his teeth on the finer points of delivering sermon like epithets and exposing his own personal demons that has resulted not only in an impressive body of work but the art of truth telling for better or worse

6882491 im not surprised im just surprised he put it out
6882492 i recently challenged my colleagues to step up to the plate and help me provide the resources our candidates need to compete in races across the country to match the dscc expenditures in targeted races

6882496 representative steven l steve driehaus repeatedly refused to provide any responses to citizens on the issues through the 2008 political courage test when asked to do so by national leaders of the political parties prominent members of the media project vote smart president richard kimball and project vote smart staff
6882497 driehaus repeated refusal to answer the political courage test should be concerning to voters who want transparency and honesty from their representatives if he isnt willing to fill out a simple survey voters should be asking why someone who put himself in the spotlight is suddenly so shy
6882498 courage is standing up to big oil and their powerful lobbyists and healthcare lobbyists who care more about their bottom line than the health of children
6882499 i look forward to debating congressman chabot on the issues and hearing him explain the courage it took to vote for multi billion dollar tax cuts for special interests and the courage it took to deny care coverage for our children
6882500 modern day political candidates often heed the destructive advice of political parties and consultants who tell them not to provide such information for fear of opposition research
6882501 with all due respect it is very easy for ceos executives and politicians who all have paid sick days themselves to oppose them for everyone else
6882502 apparently they think paid sick days are unworkable and economically harmful only if regular people are able to earn them

6882509 maybe you dont even remember the summer of 2008 any more the last period has not politely put been easy so who can be blamed for a little memory loss arent we all suffering from a bit of ptsd let me take you back to that summer when the panglossians were saying sniff the air change is just around the corner and the chicken littles were replying sniff the air you can smell the approaching flames certainly the pessimists had the weight of history on their side the bush administration they were arguing had so transformed the united states and the world that it simply wasnt possible to undo the damage if not by water they warned then the fire next time would scorch the earth free of us and that fire had the potential to come from almost any direction we had had only a narrow window of opportunity to deal with climate change and the bush team made sure to slam that window shut we needed to go all out to find sustainable sources of energy and instead the administration was all about oil if the middle east was not exactly the garden of eden when george w came into office the president had unfortunately taken his inspiration from the book of revelations not the book of genesis the result was iraq iran lebanon syria israel palestine and lets not forget afghanistan and then there were those budget deficits

6882518 barack obama is more similarly situated to bill clinton in 1992 than any other candidate in recent history
6882519 bill clinton was a new candidate on the national scene he was running in a change oriented election cycle and the economy was voters top issue a dynamic he was able to capitalize on
6882520 obama will correct his underperformance with hillary clintons primary votes and emerge with a much more cohesive base
6882521 this convention gives obama a platform to unite his base
6882522 this coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls
6882523 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question

6882588 nesse sentido a queda recente dos pre os das commodities assim como a maior estabilidade do d lar s o sinais encorajadores

6882608 y la situaci n se complica porque debemos de formar al grupo que disputar el torneo local dejar de darle su real valor al torneo de la concacaf y la prioridad para m es el campeonato mexicano algo en que la directiva est de acuerdo
6882609 tenemos muy claro al plantel que vamos a ir a enfrentar y es un encuentro que vamos a jugar con toda seriedad porque nos ilusiona el poder luchar para ir a disputar el mundial de clubes y vamos a intentar hacer un buen partido
6882610 porque en el futbol mexicano los malos resultados nos llevan a ser despedidos si en este torneo no vas bien te cortan la cabeza
6882611 adem s de que queremos darle su valor a la afici n que est necesitada de resultados algunos otros equipos pueden darle la prioridad al otro torneo porque tienen para dividir su plantel y responder en ambos pero nosotros no

6882617 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6882618 if you have never smoked you have double the risk of parkinsons disease but we do not know the reasons for that
6882619 it may be that theres something protective within cigarette smoking or it may be another factor
6882620 certain personality characteristics of individuals destined to develop parkinsons disease may make them less prone to start smoking
6882621 as dopamine levels can start to fall many years before difficulties with movement become noticeable and before a diagnosis of parkinsons disease is made an assumption that the personality traits outlined in the study cause the condition is flawed
6882622 a more likely explanation would be that declining dopamine levels prior to the onset of the motor symptoms is associated with these behaviours
6882623 needless to say for all the pleasure they bring there are a multitude of other health risks associated with nicotine alcohol and caffeine

6882642 el lunes cuando se hicieron varios tractorazos se marc la urgencia de definiciones
6882643 all life processes are directly or indirectly connected with water therefore it entitles water to have a very high priority and positioning in the environmental situation
6882644 dr ludwig you have formulated the thesis stating that water has a memory like an elephant what exactly does this statement refer to
6882645 this statement refers to the following water has the ability to transfer information once it has obtained it to other systems such as living organisms before we illuminate this in detail we will recall some of the basic characteristics of water
6882646 what few humans know is the following fact detrimental poisonously charged burdened water as we have today in our wells and municipal water supplies rivers lakes underground water etc
6882647 this is exactly what it means certain electromagnetic frequencies of heavy metal polluted water have been found in cancer tissue as well let us take the frequency 1 8 hertz which is a very low frequency we have been able to confirm that fresh water in a certain major german city carries this 1 8 hertz frequency mind you that water was distilled twice before this measurement from this we can draw the following conclusion after any cleansing purification chemical treatment filtration or even after distillation the pollutants harmful information the electromagnetic frequencies oscillations can be transferred to the human organism they are there measurably present in the water molecules both before and after any of the conventional treatments so even when our fresh water is chemically purified it is still physically pollutant information charged both before and after any conventional treatment it is not the chemical substance which affects the human organism when you drink this water it is the undesirable frequencies
6882648 water which has once been exposed to pollutants is dead even the most intensive and modern sewage treatment facilities cannot revive it it is energetically dead and it contains no useful information biologically valuable water must contain certain useful frequencies in order for the human organism to benefit from it in spite of these facts scientific research institutes are not even remotely aware of these phenomena and are not taking them into consideration not yet anyway we must remember that the materialistic view of the world only deals with let us assume one billionth of reality in the area of energetic reciprocal action or interaction between material and biological systems there has until this day only been very limited research the few results this avant garde scientific research has found have as strange as it sounds been known by humans for thousands of years especially by indigenous nations like native americans in accordance with this we know from geo biology about places with a special force or power where special plants grow which do not grow in other places physical measurements have shown the existence of a lower level than normal of gamma radiation in these power spots but this is the only known parameter out of a wide spectrum of factors of which we do not have any inkling yet it would be an extreme violation of the truth if we were to claim as a civilization that our scientists have researched and explained all of natures phenomena and wonders we might know of a tiny bit of what is really going on a small part of this is our scarce knowledge about the abilities of water and the influences of water upon the processes in living organisms
6882649 one thing is for sure our drinking water ought to be subjected to a precise spectral analysis and one should avoid drinking water which is biologically dead or even detrimental this should not be based upon some limit value set by legislation from the government but instead it should be determined by a spectroscopic analysis covering all of the frequencies from zero and into the megahertz band spectrum
6882650 environmental medicine would do very well incorporating into its scientific research these physical abilities within the water and the activity of water in the human body physicians ought to strive to set up a research program which would seek to find the intimate connection between water and living organisms discussion of the so called limits the government approved standard content of substances would then reach a totally new dimension namely the definition of living water in other words water which is useful and only useful to life forms which is totally different from just drinking water which is germ free contains a low level of nitrate or water where lead and cadmium has not exceeded the so called limits the government approved standard content of substances and therefore subsequently are considered harmless given the background of all these new and old realizations and acknowledgments our respons ability is not to look for new government science approved so called harmless limits for the content of various poisonous substances no our respons ability is to set levels in a completely different area of research namely where we are talking about life and not matter so this is a very important quality of water to be aware of in our use of water in general its ability to carry information

6882736 my parents are very depressed my mother has taken it very badly
6882737 i saw the scenes of the accident on television but i didnt know my brother was on that plane

6882740 a light has come on but i dont know what it means
6882741 he the captain said a light had come on but he didnt know what it meant
6882742 suddenly the plane started to shake it was going from one side to the other until it fell
6882743 later i just remember people on the ground smoke explosions and then i lost consciousness
6882744 i was saved by the paramedics its thanks to them that im alive i feel like ive been born again
6882745 the failure of one motor does not cause an accident im not so sure the engine failed the combination of causes will have to be determined

6882747 the problem was located it was resolved and the plane was dispatched
6882748 the technician who inspected the plane was not able to repair the system
6882749 the solution was to disconnect it not to repair it
6882750 the accident may have been impossible to predict or there might have been negligence
6882751 if the take off was authorised without the fault being properly repaired there is clearly a legal responsibility
6882752 but that must all be cleared up before any decisions are taken

6882844 the programming questions are even more profound people are struggling to program four cores or eight cores and when larrabee comes out several dozens of cores

6882917 we had dreams that computers would improve education and improve communication and help us achieve a lot of tasks a lot of us in our group understood it
6882918 what we were doing was not figuring out how build a computer it was how you get a computer that fits into the home price looks a lot of that stuff it gave us more passion we used the word revolution all over the place
6882919 the journal news department was sent an erroneous announcement about the selection of a vice presidential candidate for barack obama once we realized the announcement was erroneous we immediately withdrew the headline we regret any inconvenience this caused our readers
6882920 this is the first attempt by either party to solicit peoples input into the platform so broadly and transparently
6882921 people might think that if you look at this the democrats are much further along
6882922 but if they look at our platform were so much further along and more open too in using todays technology to get greater input
6882923 but in keeping with what sen obamas campaign is about which is breaking down the barriers between the beltway and the american people
6882924 our process was extremely democratic transparent and most of all inclusive
6882925 in stark contrast to the republicans we wanted people to meet together neighbors and strangers to discuss issues that matter to them and achieving common goals rather than operating through the anonymity of the net
6882926 that is something you couldnt get from just reading an e mail
6882927 the difference between this and four years ago is that instead of our platform committee doing three or four hearings in a road show you really got a sense of the connect between these broad policy statements and how they translate into peoples lives
6882928 we have looked at every entry that came in and one would be shocked at the value of the submissions some of which have been very comprehensive
6882929 i dont think the delegates will change significantly or at all the language on social issues that has been worked out over years
6882930 but we do want a platform that looks forward and not backwards and that means an opportunity to state more clearly than ever what we stand for what are our principles
6882931 i am sure that the committee will want to look at this
6882932 this is something everyone in society will be very concerned about
6882933 i am surprised that we are taking the lead from the european commission because this is bound to delay action on this important area which is increasingly a matter for concern it seems like a bit of a cop out to me
6882934 a lot of the research is still carried out in the traditional manner using skin from the executed prisoner and aborted foetus
6882935 in china it is considered very normal and i was very shocked that western countries can make such a big fuss about this
6882936 the government has put some pressure on all the medical facilities to keep this type of work in low profile
6882937 nowadays there is a certain fee that has to be paid to the court
6882938 cosmetic procedures are a rapidly growing area of private health care
6882939 we must ensure we properly protect patients safety by improving the training and regulation
6882940 action should be taken to protect patient safety through regulation

6882967 i told my friends to just make a wish write it down and put it in the bottle and it would come true i dont know why but we all just believed this maybe because we just wanted to or that it was something to hold on to
6882968 at a time when our entire team has been tasked with extraordinary responsibilities leading up to the geoeye 1 satellite launch brainspark media was able to take our vision and objectives for the new web presence and produce exactly what we wanted with reliability and relative ease

6882970 we are incredibly excited about our growing involvement with geoeye particularly in light of the upcoming geoeye 1 launch the superior products and services offered by geoeye have worldwide influence most of us take for granted we look forward to a long standing relationship with this remarkable company

6882972 so about a week ago an ad agency sent me a message via youtube and told me they really liked my video
6882973 i never really knew how awesome the ad was going to be and how much credit they were really going to give me i specified on the phone that i wanted my name to be on it and they surely listened
6882974 the short version of the story is they didnt want to quit their partying
6882975 if you put this in the class of wedding receptions gone bad i guess this would take the cake
6882976 also called rollback tow trucks contain a large empty bed in the back of the truck using hydraulics this bed can be inclined in order to form the shape of a ramp the vehicle can then be either driven onto the flatbed or a winch can be used to drag it into place after the vehicle is in place hydraulics are used again to level out the flatbed in order to haul the vehicle flatbed tow trucks are the preferred method for hauling vehicles because they do not place pressure on the vehicle or drag it for a period of time rather all of the stress is placed on the tow truck
6882977 yeah well actually theres still a big empty space on the wall over the side of my bed i decided to use the poster i got for that somewhere else now its just empty
6882978 of course paterson thinks its a good idea if he s term limited out bloomberg is running for governor and it s back home to harlem for the accidental gov
6882979 de gebieden nordland vi en vii rond de lofoten en vester len horen tot de veelbelovende oliewingebieden van noorwegen
6882980 maar je had ook shell of esso kunnen bellen alle oliemaatschappijen willen hier boren
6882981 men vreest een negatieve invloed op de visserij maar wij weten met dertig tot veertig jaar ervaring in de noordzee dat oliewinning en visserij heel goed samengaan
6882982 we hebben hier s werelds grootste visbestanden die brengen ons al eeuwen welvaart nergens komt zoveel haring en kabeljauw paaien oliewinning bedreigt die rijkdom niet alleen bij een ramp maar ook omdat seismisch onderzoek de vissen verjaagt
6882983 volgens een peiling is in het noorden 66 procent tegen en over heel noorwegen 58 procent enkele jaren geleden lagen die cijfers andersom toen was in het noorden nog hoop dat de olie industrie veel banen oplevert maar de grote kantoren blijven in oslo en stavanger staan
6882984 dat zet je niet op het spel met een oliebron die na zoveel jaar leeg is
6882985 de visserij en landbouw worden hier steeds minder we moeten zorgen voor nieuwe arbeidsplaatsen
6882986 deze slag winnen we we hebben alle belangrijke instituten en wetenschappelijke instellingen achter ons
6882987 partijen die voor oliewinning zijn gaan stemmen verliezen we zijn al rijk we hebben die olie nog niet nodig
6882988 echte groene politiek vereist een flinke herverdeling van welvaart tussen hoge en lage inkomens en tussen grote en kleine bedrijven een forse herverdeling tussen mobiliteit per auto en per openbaar vervoer is eveneens onontkoombaar
6882989 rutte is definitief de weg kwijt met de groenrechtse onzinagenda
6882990 rutte noemt de britse conservatieve leider david cameron zijn voorbeeld maar cameron zegt dat we n maatregelen moeten nemen terwijl de vvd eerst zijn pijlen wil richten op vrijwillige bijdragen van het bedrijfsleven
6882991 na de val van nijpels heeft de partij het onderwerp laten liggen maar traditioneel zijn veel vvders begaan met het milieu in andere europese landen zijn liberale fracties ook veel groener als je terugkijkt heeft de vvd ook de beste milieuministers geleverd beter dan die van de pvda inclusief de huidige
6882992 klimaatbeleid komt aan op een heleboel moeizame maatregelen en daar zijn ze bij de liberalen nooit heel sterk in geweest er is nog altijd een groep binnen die partij die de klimaatveranderingen afdoet als onzin
6882993 maar daarmee red je het niet de laatste rapporten over klimaatverandering en de zeespiegelstijging zien er heel somber uit zonder eisen aan de fabrikant krijg je geen zuiniger apparaten
6882994 het ligt er een beetje aan welke persoon ze deze keer meesturen het belangrijkste is dat die politiek talent heeft nijpels en winsemius waren in het begin ook redelijk onbeschreven maar zij hebben een gevoel voor milieu ontwikkeld
6882995 de afgelopen jaren was het vooral de vvd die bij het milieubeleid op de rem stond ik heb dat uit electoraal oogpunt altijd onhandig gevonden alsof een vvder niet bezorgd is om zijn leefomgeving en de manier waarop zijn kinderen opgroeien
6882996 ik zei dat ik met strenge maatregelen zou komen en daarvoor ook een kamermeerderheid achter me had dat konden ze om zeven uur s morgens nooit checken ze tekenden onderling een convenant en drie maanden later waren de eerste fosfaatvrije middelen daar
6882997 niemand in de kamer durfde op dat moment tegen de publieke opinie te stemmen die normen gelden nu twintig jaar later nog steeds als strengste in europa
6882998 met de vvd valt heel goed milieubeleid te maken sterker nog milieu is het enige terrein dat in hoge mate is bepaald door de vvd bovendien telt de partij een hele serie mensen die zich met groot enthousiasme inzetten voor het milieu zoals de wethouders in rotterdam
6882999 maar als je in de oppositie zit moet het beleid ook in eerste instantie van de andere partijen komen
6883000 bijvoorbeeld als burgers op grond van hun herkomst of religie via parlementaire besluitvorming burgerrechten worden ontzegd of als heilige boeken bij wet worden verboden zulke wetten druisen in tegen de kern van de democratie en mogen een halt worden toegeroepen
6883001 de schrijfsters zijn jong en hun stijl is simpel dat spreekt jongeren aan ook jongeren die hiervoor niet graag een boek lazen
6883002 op dit moment werken tienduizenden auteurs op wild strawberry aan een boek
6883003 lezers kijken elke dag op hun gsmetjes hoe het zich ontwikkelt en reageren op de laatste aanvullingen op basis van de reacties past een schrijver het verhaal soms aan zo krijgen lezers het gevoel dat ze er zelf een rol in spelen en wordt de roman een deel van hun dagelijkse leven
6883004 als ik even tijd heb klap ik mijn telefoon open en lees ik een stukje
6883005 met mijn mobiele telefoon kan ik schrijven waar en wanneer ik maar wil
6883006 als ik buiten loop en de wolken zie of een mooi landschap verwerk ik dat meteen in het verhaal
6883007 beschrijvingen zie je vrijwel nooit en de meeste mobiele romans zijn geschreven in de ikvorm alsof je een dagboek leest
6883008 ik zie mezelf niet als een auteur ik ben een amateur die graag schrijft vergeleken met gerenommeerde schrijvers zijn mijn zinnen misschien zwak en is de compositie van mijn roman rommelig maar mijn wil om een gevoel over te brengen is sterker dan wat dan ook en daarvoor gebruik ik heldere bondige taal die jongeren makkelijk oppikken
6883009 het is beter nu niet te praten kom maar in oktober het is nu de olympische periode begrijpt u wel
6883010 door peking de olympische spelen toe te wijzen wordt de ontwikkeling van de mensenrechten in china gestimuleerd
6883011 de overheid probeert met deze spelen de wereld te laten zien dat er basiswaarden bestaan in dit land maar niets uit de afgelopen vijftig jaar toont aan dat in china sprake is van democratie eerlijkheid en moraliteit het blijft een systeem dat puur gericht is op het behouden van controle niet op wat goed is voor mensen de propaganda van de openingsceremonie toont niet de waarheid zolang een land de waarheid verbergt kan het nooit vooruitgang boeken
6883012 heeft alles te maken met slecht onderwijs een beperkte informatievoorziening en sterke staatspropaganda

6883019 ik heb hem op televisie op de olympische spelen in peking gezien en hij kan echt heel goed judo n
6883020 vooral veel kinderen tot en met 12 jaar zitten op judo zij vormen zelfs driekwart van ons ledenbestand
6883021 sinds mark huizinga in 2000 een olympische titel haalde en er verschillende topprestaties door andere nederlandse judokas volgden is judo in nederland een stuk populairder geworden en nu we op de olympische spelen weer de grootste oogst ooit hebben gehaald zet die lijn zich duidelijk voort wat natuurlijk de nodige publiciteit met zich meebrengt
6883022 de beleving van judo is de afgelopen jaren duidelijk groter geworden judokas zijn nu ook bekenden voor de gewone nederlander
6883023 je wordt er motorisch beter van en leert een stukje discipline maar ook leer je om je stevig op te stellen en rekening te houden met de ander
6883024 ouders hebben verschillende redenen om hun kinderen op judo te doen sommige kinderen zijn een beetje timide en kunnen wat meer mansheid gebruiken die probeer ik wat weerbaarheid tegenover de andere kinderen bij te brengen anderen zijn juist te wild het is de bedoeling dat ik ze iets rustiger maak en ze leer omgaan met andere kindjes sommigen doen judo als sport erbij zodat ze goed kunnen leren vallen voor op het voetbalveld maar ze kunnen zich hier ook gewoon lekker uitleven
6883025 brams oudere broer zat al langer op judo en bram wilde dat ook graag
6883026 allereerst hebben ze een bepaalde zekerheid gekregen ze vinden het niet eng meer om een duw van een ander kind te krijgen ze gaan ook steeds meer het spelletje beheersen ik vind het leuk om daar ontwikkeling in te zien het leren vallen en om allemaal technische grepen en worpen te doen het belangrijkste vind ik dat ik een duidelijke ontwikkeling zie in de manier waarop ze met andere kinderen omgaan daarnaast is het een individuele sport waarbij ze zelf moeten presteren en leren dat als het even niet lukt en ze vallen of verliezen ze daar dan niet iemand anders de schuld van kunnen geven bram zit ook op een teamsport daar leert hij weer andere dingen ik vind het allebei belangrijk
6883027 denk aan een vast begin en eindritueel je begint met een buiging en iedereen is stil en luistert naar de docent het is heel gestructureerd en voorspelbaar wat vooral voor kinderen met autisme heel belangrijk is daarnaast kan het sommige kinderen helpen om hun beweging op een ander af te stemmen of om impulsen te remmen van de vechtsporten die er zijn is judo vooral verdedigend en niet aanvallend dit is voor sommige ouders ook een prettige gedachte als hun kind minder weerbaar is of weinig zelfvertrouwen heeft
6883028 doe ze maar op judo raadt voorzitter van de vereniging voor judo en jiu jitsuleraren ad rebel ouders van gepeste kinderen aan
6883029 zowel voor het plezier in de sport als voor de vorming van het kind is de judoleraar heel belangrijk omdat de sport toch ook een hele grote opvoedkundige waarde kan hebben
6883030 het zou echt ontzettend jammer zijn als een kindje er na een paar jaar niets meer aan vindt omdat hij geen goede leraar had
6883031 voor een deel heeft die te maken met het feit dat een aantal utopie n van onze grootouders stomweg gerealiseerd zijn er was in nederland een netwerk van sociale en maatschappelijke zekerheid dat zijn weerga niet kende dat gaf na een aanvankelijke voldoening een leeg gevoel de oude idealen waren als het ware uitgewerkt als vruchten die zich uitgezaaid hadden
6883032 de welvaart van de voorbije jaren kon in nederland jarenlang illusies voeden
6883033 het doemdenken was geen tijdelijke aanval van cultuurpessimisme het was meer een rouwperiode over onze utopie n
6883034 in de jaren zestig veranderde de arbeidsmarkt traditionele sectoren zoals de landbouw vergden steeds minder arbeid de overall kon uit het kantoorpak aan dat enorme transformatieproces n de oliecrises van de jaren zeventig zorgden in de vroege jaren tachtig voor een enorme belasting van de verzorgingsstaat belastingen gingen omhoog de banenmachine stokte ouderen gingen massaal de vut in voor jongeren was geen werk
6883035 want je wilde iets veranderen in de wereld we hebben het nu over een kloof tussen burgers en politiek toen deden de mensen tenminste wat als het hen niet zinde
6883036 de kraakbeweging was nogal intimiderend ook voor ons sommigen van hen traden op zonder aanzien des persoons ze wilden een structuur veranderen mensen moesten daarvoor wijken bij andere actiegroepen werd juist nadrukkelijk gestreefd naar geweldloosheid
6883037 maar het wegvallen van de grote ideologie n waarvoor de aanzet overigens al in de jaren zestig was gegeven bood juist ruimte om je op welk ideaal dan ook te storten
6883038 de vrouwenbeweging kreeg voor elkaar dat verkrachting binnen het huwelijk strafbaar werd de gevaren van kernenergie werden uiteindelijk onderkend andere actiegroepen werden opgenomen in keurige reguliere clubs met subsidie mede daardoor waren dergelijke actiegroepen na de jaren tachtig verdwenen
6883039 ik denk dat we toen met onze verkiezingsleus de tijdgeest perfect hebben aangevoeld
6883040 daar lag geen ideologie aan ten grondslag maar een slim reclamebureau vooral jongeren voelden zich enorm aangesproken
6883041 mijn latere echtgenoot en haar vader hebben in 82 tegen mij staan demonstreren we voeren er soms nog disputen over maar wij voelden ons indertijd eigenlijk alleen verwant met de vrouwenbeweging wat kruisraketten en kraken betreft daar waren we glashelder in v r de kruisraketten tegen kraken
6883042 de ideologie was weg de standpunten helder en voor argumenten bestond geen gevoeligheid als ik in debat ging met linkse krakers kwamen we geen steek verder hetzelfde gold voor de discussie over burgerlijke ongehoorzaamheid er lag een soort grimmigheid overheen al moet ik bekennen dat ik er ook enorm van genoot als weer eens een clubje krakers probeerde een campagnebijeenkomst te verstoren kom maar op dacht ik dan je zou kunnen betogen dat er een nieuw soort ideologie was opgekomen wij tegen zij links tegen rechts maar met de grote ideologie n had dat niets meer van doen
6883043 daardoor verdwenen de intellectuelen uit de politiek gevolg een verzakelijking en professionalisering van de politiek die bij het grote publiek steeds minder tot de verbeelding sprak de politiek die vooral heel pragmatisch werd was niet zo interessant meer
6883044 ik durf niet te stellen dat de jaren tachtig de verhouding tussen burger en politiek goed hebben gedaan
6883045 de jaren tachtig zijn bovenal het einde van de bevlogenheid het no nonsensetijdperk van lubbers n van kok begon de pvda lijdt er nog steeds onder
6883046 ik heb altijd gedacht dat de landen die zich na de val van de muur bevrijdden van de sovjetdictatuur zouden kiezen voor de sociaal democratie maar men koos voor het liberalisme voor de vrije markt dat sloeg over op heel europa
6883047 ze hadden weinig vertrouwen in inspraak men probeerde zn zin te krijgen door direct fysiek af te dwingen het was niet op participatie gericht op meedoen in het systeem zoals in de jaren zestig maar eerder op het tegendeel op dissociatie een zich afsluiten in een eigen subcultuur
6883048 de eerste helft van de jaren tachtig lag amsterdam letterlijk en figuurlijk onder vuur van de kraakbeweging de kraakbeweging had als ideologie dat deze rechtsorde niet de hunne was niet alleen de namen en adressen van haagse ambtenaren werden in bluf gepubliceerd ook die van amsterdamse agenten en ambtenaren
6883049 de krakers overspeelden hun hand ze verloren steeds meer de sympathie van de bevolking omdat het sociale doel van huisvesting omsloeg in provocaties en eigenrichting
6883050 de jaren tachtig lijden aan een hele serie clich s
6883051 maar er was wel degelijk cohesie en saamhorigheid in de samenleving in de jaren tachtig werd giro 555 ge ntroduceerd e n voor afrika werd een van de succesvolste inzamelingsacties uit de geschiedenis en heel veel mensen deden gewoon hun werk
6883052 in amsterdam zuidoost hebben wij toen kunnen bereiken wat nu in de veertig prachtwijken wordt nagestreefd
6883053 er wordt nu wat meewarig teruggekeken naar het genuanceerde beleid dat wij toen voerden mijn eenvoudige boodschap was we zijn allemaal amsterdammers ik ben er nog steeds van overtuigd dat het een goede aanpak was maar de aantallen migranten waren wel veel kleiner
6883054 die problemen hebben we wel op een pragmatische wijze opgepakt en daarmee hebben we een zeer sterke basis voor de toekomst gelegd dat hadden de mensen in het land echt wel in de gaten
6883055 its funny how few people understand how easy it is to track activity via ip address for example the startup ceos who leave comments here under their real name and then suddenly go trolling under an anonymous name all under the same ip

6883070 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6883071 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6883072 i saw that announcement we will continue to monitor the situation but we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now
6883073 there has been some movement of forces but whether or not that is an indication of a withdrawal or just a repositioning of forces is a bit difficult to determine at this point but those movements remain minor

6883097 the fact that we erased all of yesterday s gains so fast suggests that we re still in a bear market there s just not much demand out there
6883098 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybody s dumping commodities again
6883099 obviously yesterday s rally was overcooked and we re simply taking back some of that speculative risk premium we injected into the market
6883100 it s still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6883101 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6883102 the pullout was carried out without any incidents and was completed according to plan at 19 50 moscow time
6883103 peacekeeping checkpoints in the security zone inside georgia have started carrying out the tasks set before them in this way the russian side has implemented the agreements set out by the presidents of russia and france
6883104 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6883105 the fact of the pullout of occupying forces from the main towns under enormous pressure from the international community is a good start and a step in the right direction

6883129 maybe the death of criticism is due to the lack of credibility and factual reporting in journalism for example redacted so you can remove that tired example from your essay all it takes is a bit of research rather then lazy comparisons to make a piece compelling

6883150 the whole idea of lifestreaming is very interesting indeed but none the less a few uncertainties comes to my mind besides the many possibilities i would like to emphasize a few topics

6883228 awal aku terjun sebagai pembaca berita bisa dibilang karena iseng tapi lama lama aku semakin mencintai pekerjaan ini
6883229 dari awal metro tv sudah wanti wanti kita tidak hanya sebagai pembaca berita tapi lebih kepada jurnalis yang juga turun mencari data di lapangan jadi aku nggak pernah menyebut diriku sebagai news reader
6883230 karena nggak punya basic jurnalistik banyak kesalahan dan kekonyolan yang aku lakukan
6883231 ketika mendadak ditugaskan ke irak siap nggak siap juga dan ras khawatir terus menghantui karena memasuki daerah konflik kejadiannya justru di saat kita sudah bertolak ke indonesia lewat jordania di tengah jalan kami ditelepon metro tv untuk balik lagi memperpanjang liputan ada tantangan kita harus masuk ke daerah karbala yang sangat rawan nah diculiknya dalam perjalanan ke sana kalo dipikir pikir lebih bagus diculik karena daerah itu justru semakin rawan
6883232 satu hal yang aku ambil sebagai pelajaran pembekalan diri untuk keselamatan selama kerja itu penting sekali saat ini aku ditawari ikut pelatihan keselamatan wartawan terkadang ketika diberi tantangan liputan seorang logika seorang wartawan suka hilang ketika berhadapan dengan bahaya atau masuk ke daerah konflik wartawan juga seharusnya tahu kapan saatnya melanjutkan dan menyudahi liputan
6883233 prospek sebagai penyiar tv sangat bagus karena secara nggak langsung membuat kita terkenal dan punya koneksi apalagi kita sering mewawancarai orang penting mereka akan sangat berguna buat kita kelak
6883234 saya harap kehadiran buku ini dapat menjadi acuan bagi mereka yang ingin terjun ke dunia pertelevisian

6883238 we have to work on projects that will reach an audience
6883239 it is more expensive to produce and there is a greater risk of not being able to recoup money

6883261 pasti ada maksud allah menaruh saya di sini berkumpul bersama orang orang yang tidak terbayangkan saya bisa bersama meraka dan kenapa itu terjadi pada diri saya ini pasti ada maksudnya ada pelajaran yang mesti saya tarik
6883262 allah mempertemukan orang orang yang berbeda beda yang awalnya penuh ketakutan dan kecurigaan dengan niat dan tujuan berbeda beda kemudian disatukan selama tujuh hari
6883263 terus terang yang paling aku takutkan selama disandera adalah kapal militer as dan bukan para mujahidin
6883264 kamu sudah bebas kamu pilih sendiri kapan mau berangkat kalau malam ini tak ada yang berani keluar malam atau kamu mau berangkat besok senin pagi
6883265 malam itu kami diselamatkan oleh tuhan melalui para pejuang pejuang ini mereka membawa kami mereka betul betul bertanggung jawab tidak membiarkan kami di sana karena kami di tangan mereka dan mereka bertanggung jawab sampai kami betul betul dibebaskan
6883266 hari mulai gelap kondisi mobil sudah tua penumpangnya enam orang dengan muatan barang begitu banyak saya baru kali itu melihat para penjaga mujahidin panik
6883267 akhirnya kita baca doa sama sama sungguh ajaib ketika sang pemimpin yang di depan membaca la haula wala quwwata illabillahi tiada daya dan kekuatan selain dari allah red mesin mobil hidup kami melanjutkan perjalanan di bawah penerangan cahaya bulan dan kedip bintang
6883268 di situ saya sudah mulai mendengar suara anak kecil mereka baru menjelaskan ternyata pasukan koalisi dan militer as sudah di goa lambat sedikit habislah semua makanya kita baru mengerti kenapa mereka begitu panik yang datang ke goa adalah infantri dengan pasukan lengkap siap melumat dan menghabisi kami
6883269 di situ benar benar terlihat beda antara hidup dan mati sangat tipis siapa lagi kalau bukan allah yang memilih
6883270 aku merasakan ini semua bukti dari cinta dan kasih sayang allah apalagi setelah sampai di indonesia
6883271 pertama kita masuk goa kosong tak ada apa apa malam itu mulai ada suplai makanan berupa kebab mereka mulai membawa alat tidur dan selimut mereka melayani kita
6883272 bayangkan kita selama tujuh hari bersama sama makan juga kita sama sama karena ruangannya sangat sempit kita nggak bisa shalat berjamaah
6883273 mereka tembakkan senjata dan peluru kosongnya dijadikan paku mereka sangat kreatif
6883274 ini yang membuat semakin lama kita tambah dekat karena saat bikin teh itu mulai dari masak airnya dan sambil menunggu masak air kita ngobrol saya bilang kalau di indonesia kita minum teh gelasnya besar besar tidak kecil seperti ini

6883278 on 23 march 1994 the medical examiner viewed the body of ronald opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound of the head
6883279 a person who sets out to commit suicide ultimately succeeds even though the mechanism might not be what he intended
6883280 the room on the ninth floor whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife
6883281 when one intends to kill subject a but kills subject b in the attempt one is guilty of the murder of subject b
6883282 the continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couples son loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal incident it transpired that the old lady cut off her sons financial support and the son knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother the case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of ronald opus
6883283 further investigation revealed that the son ronald opus had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to engineer his mothers murder
6883284 you people really dont have any clue yet of the true heinousness of what ive done

6883287 we would like to clarify that his holiness did not mention any number of casualties
6883288 in response to a question from the journalist about recent news stating that chinese troops had fired on a demonstration his holiness clearly stated that we had no specific information on the number of casualties
6883289 we just heard that but no possibility to cross check so i dont know
6883290 there was a language problem in the translation of the comments by his holiness the dalai lama
6883291 bitch drink the rest of that you know we dont waste shit

6883297 coreopsis verticillata dyssodia tenuiloba he doesnt understand he is deliriously happy
6883298 we need to relieve the burden on the va from routine health care
6883299 if you have a routine health care need take it wherever you want whatever doctor or health care provider and get the treatment you need while we at the va focus our attention our care our love on these grievous wounds of war
6883300 received consistently better care across the board including screening diagnosis treatment and follow up
6883301 ideologues like john mccain and george bush hate the fact that the va exists
6883302 they hate the fact that theres a functional example out there of the government providing better care at a lower cost than the private sector
6883303 the problem that the va faces now is that the bush administration failed to hire enough doctors and disability claims adjusters when they chose to go to war with iraq if these doctors had been hired the va would be an example of the government doing good work bush and mccain dont want the public to see that
6883304 if im driving a humvee in iraq and a roadside bomb explodes and i veer off the road and crush my arm and end up losing it and needing a prosthetic is that a combat wound according to sen mccain
6883305 if mccain would work to properly fund va care there would be no issue about a va card
6883306 mccain by wanting to give vets private care is walking away from the va and ignoring the problem
6883307 for every vet who would get a va card that would be one less vet using the va
6883308 would mean in a short period of time a smaller budget fewer locations and the eventual dismantling of the best health care system in the country
6883309 this is how i am feeling and i dont exactly know what to do with it
6883310 yes everything is possible yes everything is possible yes everything is possible
6883311 the thing with you is that you somehow managed to take a tiny percent of yourself the smallest fraction and turn it into your only equation in this life there are so many sides to everything and that includes you you have so many things waiting to come out and yet you insist on building from only one part of yourself you wouldnt point to your pinky and say this is my entire body just like you wouldnt look at one branch and declare that this is a tree but if you add all of the little puzzle pieces together it makes up one entire picture but right now how you live and how you create you are just a little torn corner of a photograph and i know deep inside you even more so than me you are dying to see whats in the rest of the frame
6883312 a single hand can write several stories you have made your point you have said everything you can about it lay that old character aside for a minute and allow yourself to make some new ones put them in films paintings poems or songs give them different names if you like they can be heroes or villains it doesnt matter but what does matter is that all of them together standing side by side will make up one thing as a whole and thats you be brand new let yourself have the innocence of a kid again have it be your call to arms make a revival out of it
6883313 the benjy davis project is one of the coolest acts ive come across in years the band is tight live and they deliver a knockout punch with singer songwriter benjy davis im very happy to have had a hand in getting them into the rock ridge family

6883316 the project has gone about the business of becoming a credible college rock band the hard way grinding it out on the road and writing the sort of autobiographical anthems that southern teens want to sing along to
6883317 benjy davis project has become a cohesive unit playing folk rock arrangements that find the members interacting intuitively whether the sound is flavored with a banjo a violin a mandolin or a hammond b 3 organ the point is always to support the voice he sings in a slightly gruff tenor with an elastic sense of rhythm the better to add conviction and vulnerability to his lyrics which are personal and straightforward his main subject is the ups and downs of love throughout he creates an appealing character and his backup band adds real punch to his songs
6883318 authenticity is captured more on dust than any of benjy davis projects previous cds the new songs meld rock and country into undeniably catchy pop audiences throughout the nation have been receptive to the gifted unassuming young band from baton rouge
6883319 looking for a band that has a singer who can fill the air with hope and at the same time catch the darkness in his hands benjy davis has been doing just that the past five years there are at least six songs on dust that youd bet your car keys were smash hits
6883320 when we first met bobby capps who handles a amp r for rock ridge music we liked him right away he supports our music and understands our vision im excited about the upcoming cd and the potential of our new deal with a great team
6883321 the benjy davis project is one of the coolest acts ive come across in years the band is tight live and they deliver a knockout punch with singer songwriter benjy davis im very happy to have had a hand in getting them into the rock ridge family

6883369 no its actually not its going to be in st paul
6883370 but ive been here since 1987 i know minneapolis better because this is where i landed when i got off the plane

6883383 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for

6883391 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond

6883415 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
6883416 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker

6883425 in the last four years or five years we used movies in our experiments
6883426 but we used movies basically to understand about the brain
6883427 you can think about it as control by the director
6883428 hitchcock managed to take each main area and cause it to respond in a similar way so he basically controlled whats going on in the brain
6883429 you can think of it as real life or the most boring movie ever
6883430 they like to leave things open ended and ambiguous for different kinds of feelings so if director sees a strong correlation maybe he or she thinks they failed
6883431 but then if you think about other movies they dont leave anything open they want to control as much of the brain as possible
6883432 you can go to the area that processes the soundtrack see any correlations and then go to the lighting and then the plot and so forth

6883710 treasury could try to provide the companies with additional funds through the line of credit but the companies rely on the capital markets buying their debt for liquidity the minute the markets see that the companies are unable to fund themselves through the normal debt operations then treasury and the new regulator have to figure out how to deal with them without creating a panic in the debt and equity markets you cant go in for just a dime you have to go in for the whole kit and caboodle and thats when i think fannie and freddies new regulator will have to take some action to force the companies to once and for all recognize all of their losses and then the government takes over the companies
6883711 this is like a typical bank resolution they are shut down on a friday or taken over right at the close of business on a friday and a pass through receivership happens they open up on monday as a new entity lets say fannie mae ii this time they are owned by the government the government has wiped out shareholders preferred shareholders subordinated debt holders and the government decides what to do with senior debt holders and there they could decide to force them to take a haircut on what they are owed or more likely theyll just say ok well back all of the debt youve got that fannie and freddie previously issued and thats probably the smart thing to do
6883712 thats the way it happens so on monday it opens up there are no disruptions to the housing market because this happens in a seamless transaction just like a bank resolution fannie and freddie ii would open up on a monday and they continue to either buy mortgages they continue to issue mortgage backed securities only this time they are backed by the full faith and credit of the government
6883713 it would be done through fannie and freddies new regulator s receivership powers so the new regulator would appoint a receiver or lets say a conservator of the new fannie mae ii the bad debt of the companies would be left in the old fannie and freddie and everything else would be transferred to the new entity
6883714 senior debt holders would be ok there is a small amount of subordinated debt that both companies have issued that would probably either get completely wiped out or suffer some serious haircut
6883715 yeah and some people have worked themselves up into a frenzy and say oh my god the housing market but actually the companies that open on monday continue to function just as they did before just now theyve been taken over by the government and i would argue that this brings some much needed stability to the housing market you remove the uncertainty of whats going to happen with these two companies and youve actually i think begun to lower interest rates on mortgages freddie paid a 113 basis point spread over treasuries in their recent debt offering if the government is now issuing the debt to fund the companies the fannie mae ii operations they are not paying that premium so the savings could get passed on to the consumer in the form of lower interest rates
6883716 it could happen as soon as the end of september i think it probably would happen before the end of the year
6883717 then its a policy question for the government do they turn them into an agency and have the government take over their roles or would they just slowly wind them down and sort of transition them to a scenario where the private sector starts to take over the functions of these two companies
6883718 sure they were before the boom in the housing market the private sector had over 60 percent of the market share in mortgage backed securities and they could certainly take over that function again
6883719 they cant go back to the way they were before i think that is just not even an option because it is clear the government will step in and bail out these two companies which they regard as too big to fail and if they were allowed to remain in their current condition then you have two private shareholder companies issuing debt backed by the u s government thats just a dangerous situation

6883727 its exhilarating it usually has really awesome music and it kicks your butt you know that youre really working hard when you do it
6883728 i didnt actually think it was my first no 1
6883729 somehow in my mind i dont know what the opposite of a state of denial was but i thought for sure i had a no 1 album somewhere along the way i thought hot august night was no 1 but then i was told it only went to no 2 so i was crestfallen
6883730 its a nice feeling to be no 1 i enjoyed every moment of the time that i was no 1 and i enjoyed the fact that people became aware that it was my first no 1 and they were a little amazed at that also im told that im also the oldest performer on billboard charts ever to have a no 1 album which amazes me i dont feel that old i feel very young but its nice to feel that in this market thats filled with young people or seems to be aimed at young people that an old geezer can come along and knock a few of them off their perches and say hey heres one for the senior citizens and we can kick a little butt too
6883731 the highs were that i was able to actually continue to write songs that i liked you always have that lingering doubt when you take on a project because ive been doing this since i was 16 years old and you just never do know whether something is going to come out
6883732 i was never good enough to because to follow a trend you have to be able to know what the trend is you have to be able to copy it and you have to know enough about music to be a good imitator and ive never been that ive always had to follow my own thing because it was the only thing i could do it was the only thing i felt i could do well so i havent followed any trends to me trends dont exist the only trend is music either its good or its bad either its beautiful or its not either it involves the listener or it doesnt either it moves me when i perform it or not these are the considerations
6883733 no i like the way i was invented originally ive kind of gotten used to it this is just another step thats all im not doing anything logical im not pre planning anything maybe i would have had a better career if i had and thought it out but it was all based on how well i could write the songs and how good the songs would be and how the audience took it to their hearts or not and its still that way exactly that way

6883741 instead he came out of that house with a knife where he stabbed the defenceless dr victoria anyetei
6883742 by this wicked act you have deprived a son of a loving mother a close family of a loving and supportive sister and the public of a dedicated and able physician
6883743 a vacuum in our lives which will never be filled
6883744 we take consolation in the fact that victoria is now in a place where nobody can harm her
6883745 the presidency is satisfied with dr amoos performance and has at no point in time gone into closed door meeting to discuss his removal
6883746 as solid and smooth as ever and more than capable of dealing with any adventurers if they ever rear their heads
6883747 the npp approached us and requested that they needed to use the song for their campaign this year and that was it
6883748 i am not worried at all that the npp is using my song it is a popular song and i hear it is even played in some clubs so i am not worried a political party is using it
6883749 look that song is very inspirational and encourages people to go higher in whatever field of endeavour they are and if the npp is using it to tell ghanaians to go higher with them i am cool with that
6883750 the npp did not buy it from me per se but we had a negotiation for them to pay a sum of money for the copyright and that is the norm

6883755 it may go against reason but living on the cheap is not the best way to save money if you want to get the most for your money you are going to have to spend one of the biggest mistakes people make when they are trying to get their finances in order is to stop spending money altogether not all spending is the same you should limit unnecessary purchases but spending on essential upkeep preventive measures and items that will save money in the long run is vital for getting and keeping your finances in order
6883756 and with only some three months to the elections it is becoming increasingly clear that dr sowah will be a non starter and the earlier we replace him the better it will be for the fortunes of the party
6883757 we know la dadekotopon is one of our strongholds and we are determined to wrest the constituency which we unfortunately lost to the ndc in the 2004 elections
6883758 but we can only do so if we get our house in order and undertake our campaign in full swing
6883759 we expect to inject some expertise but it would not be long term over the period it would be ghanaians who would be in charge and ghanaian expertise would also be deployed in other places where vodafone operates
6883760 our solutions are customised to meet the needs of each person of an entire enterprise to any level in any industry to succeed in our delivery of service we rely on the understanding of our customers and this is what we are committed to doing in ghana
6883761 we would wish to be judged by our actions we believe that we are qualified and have the record of accomplishment to change the face of telecommunications in the country and we will do this by demonstrating it on the job
6883762 we will deliver on our promises and show that we are the right choice
6883763 we would work closely with the government and people of ghana to achieve set targets
6883764 though i am in opposition i support the governments efforts which confirms that ghanaians could manage their own affairs
6883765 the search for oil started under the busia regime but was stalled with the overthrow of the government by the acheampong coup detat the resources simply vanished thereafter but resurfaced under the npp administration

6883771 the said report also cited dr nduom for illegal receipts of per diem payments from sec totalling 41 261 having improperly held himself out as a foreign consultant and at the same time when he was concurrently a consultant at various companies
6883772 the cpp is currently in a state of anxiety over the fate of dr nduom a situation which has been aggravated by the disclosure of the sfos acting executive secretary in a letter dated february 7 2001 to the appointments committee of parliament to the effect that the sec case can still be said to be pending the findings notwithstanding
6883773 almost invariably there will be uncertainties about effects and effectiveness when new treatments are devised treatment effects are very seldom overwhelmingly obvious so carefully designed fair tests are necessary to identify the effects reliably see chapter 3 without a fair unbiased evaluation the risk is that useless or even harmful treatments are deemed helpful or conversely that helpful treatments are dismissed as useless untested theories about treatments effects however convincing they may sound are not enough
6883774 four focus groups of patients rheumatologists physiotherapists and general practitioners were unanimous in making clear that they did not want any more trials sponsored by pharmaceutical companies comparing yet another non steroidal anti inflammatory drug the group of drugs that includes for example ibuprofen against a placebo dummy drug
6883775 minor changes in drug formulation rarely lead to the drugs having substantially new more useful effects yet these types of studies dominate research into treatments for arthritis and for other disorders what a waste of resources
6883776 drug licensing authorities often make the problem worse by insisting that new drugs should be compared with placebos rather than with existing effective treatments
6883777 many people within universities and research funding organisations believe that improvements in health are most likely to stem from attempts to unravel basic mechanisms of disease so they do research in laboratories and with animals although such basic research is unquestionably needed there is precious little evidence to support this bias towards it

6883782 it is still necessary that as civil society we intervene to ensure that ghana gets the best deal in the process
6883783 the interim epa is fraudulent because it goes beyond what it claims to do instead of focusing on trade in goods the agreement actually captures the singapore issues such as procurement trade related issues and intellectual property rights
6883784 more importantly from the point of view of genuine development the iepas are also a framework for expansion into full and comprehensive epas which include commitments that have been rejected and thrown out of the wto such as universal liberalisation and deregulation of services and investment rules
6883785 equally such clarification will facilitate linkages and mobilisation of strategic constituencies and help sustain the upscaling of the stop epa campaign and its broad range of advocacy and campaign interventions outside and inside the official negotiations

6883791 i hear he has hit the campaign trail with an animated vengeance
6883792 the man attracts the headlines faster than giant magnets attract pins
6883793 the npp propaganda machinery would be extremely delighted to have a big boom show on the campaign trail to work great campaign spins with
6883794 on the contrary the mans presence on the ndcs campaign trail may be the last thing the npp wants dont you think
6883795 some folks really love the mans explosions some for sheer entertainment and others because it unsettles his opponents and makes them fret
6883796 if the ndc people can confine him to strategic locations the man could catch them votes you know

6884119 all questions about the vp selection should be directed to the obama campaign
6884120 obvio usly the most important question is is this person ready to be president the second most important question from my perspective is can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally and the third criteria for me i think was independence i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6884122 cannot imagine that many americans would not consider it a privilege
6884123 verily i have vowed a fast unto ar rahmaan the most beneficent allaah
6884124 the month of ramadaan in which was revealed the qur n a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion between right and wrong
6884125 o allaahs apostle inform me what allaah has made compulsory for me as regards the prayers
6884126 you have to offer perfectly the five compulsory prayers in a day and night 24 hours unless you want to pray nawafil
6884127 inform me what allaah has made compulsory for me as regards fasting
6884128 you have to fast during the whole month of ramadan unless you want to fast more as nawafil
6884129 tell me how much zakat allaah has enjoined on me
6884130 by him who has honoured you i will neither perform any nawafil nor will i decrease what allaah has enjoined on me
6884131 if he is saying the truth he will succeed or he will be granted paradise
6884132 fasting is a shield with which a servant protects himself from fire
6884133 fasting is a protection and a strong fortress that keeps a person safe from the fire
6884134 o messenger of allaah tell me of an action by which i may enter paradise
6884135 indeed anyone who fasts for one day for allaahs pleasure allaah will keep his face away from the hell fire for a distance covered by a journey of seventy years
6884136 whoever fasts one day seeking the pleasure of allaah if that is the last day of his life he will enter paradise
6884137 allaah said all the deeds of adams sons people are for them except fasting which is for me and i will give the reward for it
6884138 by him in whose hands my soul is the smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of allaah than the smell of musk
6884139 fasting and the quran intercede for the servant on the day of resurrection
6884140 there is a gate in paradise called ar raiyan and those who observe fasts will enter through it on the day of resurrection and none except them will enter through it
6884141 whoever does not give up forged speech and evil actions allaah is not in need of his leaving his food and drink i
6884142 allaah said if one of you is fasting he should avoid sexual relation with his wife and quarrelling and if somebody should fight or quarrel with him he should say i am fasting
6884143 the duaa of the fasting person will not be refused
6884144 also excited to begin writing songs for a new solo album
6884145 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
6884146 the fact that the us ruled out this compromise proposal permits only one conclusion that the missile shield is directed first and foremost not against iran but against russia this is underlined by the fact that the other bases for the missile system are also located in border regions to russia for example alaska
6884147 the missile system is therefore a crucial element in the attempt to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for the stationing of just ten interceptor missiles in poland but once the system is established their number could be easily increased
6884148 this article makes very clear the actual function of the missile system it is to guarantee the us the capacity to carry out nuclear war without the risk of a counter strike if this capacity can be achieved then it can be employed as a geopolitical argument in order to implement national interests

6884180 while we deeply regret the circumstances surrounding indymacs failure we believe that there is insufficientevidence for us to investigate senator schumer at this time
6884181 while senator schumersstatements may have accelerated public concern about indymacsfinancial condition we do not believe that we can prove thatthey caused the banks failure
6884182 we have no reason to believe that senatorschumers statements were false
6884183 the main thing is to be clever in this matter and not to look for a struggle where it can be avoided
6884184 there was nothing new in hitlers anti semitism it was endemic in vienna and everything he ever said or wrote about the jews is only a reflection of the anti semitic periodicals and pamphlets he read in vienna before 1914
6884185 the jews were responsible for bring negroes into the rhineland with the ultimate idea of bastardizing the white race which they hate and thus lowering its cultural and political level so that the jew might dominate
6884186 astuteness the ability to lie twist cheat and flatter the elimination of sentimentality or loyalty in favor of ruthlessness were the qualities which enabled men to rise above all strength of will such were the principles which hitler drew from his years in vienna he learned to lie with conviction and to dissemble with candor
6884187 i am not ashamed to acknowledge today that i was carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment and that i sank down upon my knees and thanked heaven out of the fullness of my heart for the favour of having been permitted to live in such a time mein kampf p 146 7
6884188 we are now met by the question do we wish to restore germany to freedom and power if yes then the first thing to do is rescue it from the jew who is ruining our country we want to stir up a storm men must not sleep they ought to know that a thunderstorm is coming up we want to prevent our germany from suffering as another did the death upon the cross
6884189 another picture of the nazi leader at this time is given by kurt ludecke i knew hitler pp 171 2 ludecke had gone to visit hitler in munich at the end of september and after an evening spent in hitlers company at his munich flat listening to him denounce the influence of christianity he accompanied him by car to a mass hitler youth demonstration in potsdam
6884190 however weak the individual may be when compared with the omnipotence and will of providence yet at the moment when he acts as providence would have him act he becomes immeasurably strong
6884191 it was in this sense of mission that hitler a man who believed neither in god nor in conscience a jewish invention a blemish like circumcision found both justification and absolution
6884192 i often feel that we will have to undergo all the trials the devil and hell can devise before we achieve final victory i may be no pious churchgoer but deep within me i am nevertheless a devout man that is to say i believe that he who fights valiantly obeying the laws which a god has established and who never capitulates but instead gathers his forces time after time and always pushes forward such a man will not be abandoned by the lawgiver rather he will ultimately receive the blessing of providence and that blessing has been imparted to all great spirits in history
6884193 the church is certainly necessary for the people it is a strong conservative element
6884194 you see its been our misfortune to have the wrong religion

6884196 the great figures of terror in our century hitler stalin and their deputies were programmatic anti christians
6884197 we cannot make jesus a guerrilla fighter a rebel a political agitator and revolutionary or turn his message of gods kingdom into a program of politico social action unless we distort and reinterpret all the gospel accounts make a completely one sided choice of sources irresponsibly and arbitrarily work with isolated texts and largely ignore jesus message as a whole even though it is as much the fashion today to speak of jesus the rebel the revolutionary as it was in hitlers time to speak of jesus the fighter the leader the military commander or in sermons of the first world war of jesus the hero and patriot it must be made unmistakably clear for jesus own sake regardless of the spirit of the age that he was neither a supporter of the system nor a politico social revolutionary k ng p 187 alan bullock alan bullock is a journalist and biographer of adolf hitler hitler had been brought up as a catholic and was impressed by the organization and power of the church its hierarchical structure its skill in dealing with human nature and the unalterable character of its creed were all features from which he claimed to have learned for the protestant clergy he had nothing but contempt they are insignificant little people submissive as dogs and they sweat with embarrassment when you talk to them they have neither a religion they can take seriously nor a great position to defend like rome conversation with rauschning on 7 april 1933 hitler speaks p 62 it was the great position of the church that he respected the fact that it lasted for so many centuries towards its teaching he showed the sharpest hostility in hitlers eyes christianity was a religion fit only for slaves he detested its ethics in particular its teaching he declared was a rebellion against the natural law of selection by struggle and the survival of the fittest taken to its logical extreme christianity would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure hitlers table talk london 1953 p 57 from political considerations he restrained his anti clericalism seeing clearly the dangers of strengthening the church by persecution for this reason he was more circumspect than some of his followers like rosenberg and bormann in attacking the church publicly but once the war was over he promised himself he would root out and destroy the influence of the christian churches the evil that is gnawing at our vitals he remarked in february 1942 is our priests of both creeds i cant at present give them the answer theyve been asking for but its all written down in my big book the time will come when ill settle my account with them theyll hear from me all right i shant let myself be hampered with judicial scruples hitlers table talk p 304 the truth is that in matters of religion at least hitler was a rationalist and a materialist the dogma of christianity he declared in one of his wartime conversations gets worn away before the advances of science gradually the myths crumble all that is left is to prove that in nature there is no frontier between the organic and the inorganic when understanding of the universe has become widespread when the majority of men know the stars are not sources of light but worlds perhaps inhabited worlds like ours then the christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity the man who lives in communion with nature necessarily finds himself in opposition to the churches and that why theyre heading for ruin for science is bound to win hitlers table talk pp 59 61 konrad heiden historian heiden is an interesting source writing as a contemporary of the third reich however he writes without the benefit of the documentary evidence captured by the allies and without the testimony of the nuremberg war crimes trials these national socialists were concerned with more than power many were out for more than advantages they wanted their life to have a new meaning their existence in society a purpose their value for their own people was the one thing that gave their careers on earth any value to many and not always the worst among them only faith in their fatherland had retained any meaning their own nation had become god if they hesitated openly to declare themselves religious unbelievers hitler had provided them with a suitable formula we know two gods one in heaven and another on earth the second is germany but we are germany hitler had said on another occasion and we meant i and so there were people who prayed to hitler perhaps without realizing that this was prayer der fuehrer by konrad heiden pp 631 it was at this time 1922 that hitler began to believe in his own god given mission it was no accident that in his own words he learned from the bible with boundless love how our lord and savior seized his whip and marched on jerusalem was not he himself armed with a heavy crocodile whip marching through the streets of his beloved munich which he sometimes called the mecca of national socialism a short time previous it is true he had admitted in a chastened mood to his friend georg schott all of us are nothing but little saint johns i am waiting for a christ but the period of modesty was drawing to a close were not all the signs by which heaven customarily announces its prophets being fulfilled in him the fanatical faith of the disciples the rejoicing of the masses the hostility or contempt of those in high places and now wasnt he going through a sort of golgotha his golgotha to be sure was nothing more impressive than the month in prison which he wished so fervently to avoid but before going in he took leave of his people with the words two thousand years ago the mob of jerusalem dragged a man to execution in just this way hitler introduced as a speaker explains how judah tried to conquer the world first with the help of the ten commandments then this was only hinted rather shamefacedly by christianity finally through marxism and bolshevism for hitler and eckart had no doubt that lenin was a jew der fuehrer p 280 a metaphysical line runs through mein kampf not always easy to find amid all the vulgar vilification and barren long winded meditations here a man seeks for god and discovers himself this is exactly what happened to solovievs antichrist he too like hitler had written in his thirty third year a book in which he claimed to be the savior der fuehrer p 281 ian hershaw historian kershaws fine book the hitler myth presents an in depth study of german public opinion and how it was manipulated by nazi propaganda this book also has an excellent list of sources an excerpt follows apart from the organized sectors of the working class the nazis had greatest difficulty as is well known in penetrating the catholic sub culture where the dominant image of hitler provided by catholic opinion leaders was equally negative the main attack was levelled at the anti christian essence of the nazi movement and of its leaders philosophy publications sought to demonstrate that hitlers ideas stood in direct contradiction to the teaching of the christian catechism especially in bavaria where catholicism was dominant and extreme anti marxism widespread he and his movement were seen as a variant of godless bolshevism an association which was frequently to recur after 1933 during the church struggle though catholic anti nazi polemics generally concentrated on attacking the anti religious and especially anti catholic thrust of nazism some publications did offer a devastating assault on the entire nazi doctrine hitlers brutality contempt for human rights warmongering and elevation of force to a principle of political behaviour were all castigated in catholic publications of the early 1930s one catholic weekly above all der gerade weg published in munich under the editorship of dr fritz gerlich murdered in dachau in 1934 and fr ingbert naab kept up a relentless assault on hitler describing him in september 1932 at a time when despite his open show of solidarity with five of his sa men who had been condemned to death for the brutal murder of a communist in potempa the centre party was involved in negotiations with the nazis as the incarnation of evil a few months earlier the alleged hostility of hitler to the church had played a key role in persuading the catholic parties to support the protestant and pious hindenburg in the election for the reich presidency they were equally concerned to attack and debunk the neo pagan deification and mythologizing of hitler one speaker told of a woman who had erected an altar in her house with a picture of hitler in place of the monstrance and declared that he could simply not understand the german people for letting itself be led astray by such a charlatan hitler has succeeded in organizing the idiots and only idiots hysterics and fools to go the nsdap his election he prophesied would bring irreparable harm and destruction to germany hitler was himself well aware of the need to counter his anti christian image if his party were to break through in catholic areas he was keen even in the early 1920s not to antagonize unnecessarily the catholic church and during the rise to power the nsdap made particular efforts largely in vain in catholic areas such as the rhineland and bavaria to emphasize its positive christianity to deny the slur that it was an anti religious party and to claim that national socialism alone could provide the church with a barrier against marxism
6884198 when i came to berlin a few weeks ago and looked at the traffic in the kurfuerstendamm the luxury the perversion the iniquity the wanton display and the jewish materialism disgusted me so thoroughly that i was almost beside myself i nearly imagined myself to be jesus christ when he came to his fathers temple and found it taken by the money changers i can well imagine how he felt when he seized a whip and scourged them out
6884199 when a man gets to the point of identifying himself with jesus christ then he is ripe for an insane asylum
6884200 my feeling as a christian points me to my lord and saviour as a fighter it points me to the man who once in loneliness surrounded by only a few followers recognized these jews for what they were and summoned me to fight against them and who gods truth was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter in boundless love as a christian and as a man i read through the passage which tells us how the lord rose at last in his might and seized the scourge to drive out of the temple the brood of vipers and adders how terrific was the fight for the world against the jewish poison

6884212 effective immediately i hereby wish to submit my resignation from my position with the uw hockey program as an assistant coach and goalie coach
6884213 although this was a long thought out and difficult decision for me and my family to make their support thoughts insight and understanding made this decision much easier to make i am fortunate at this time to have many other opportunities as a goalie consultant and coach
6884214 i still have a great passion for teaching and coaching players and goalies at all age levels i therefore am not retiring from coaching but simply moving in a different direction its been a lot of fun a great run and has been very rewarding

6884217 in these times of high gasoline prices i believe the federal government should do all it can to ensure that federal agencies and departments are appropriately reducing gasoline consumption this goal can be accomplished with the adoption of personnel policies to limit unnecessary commuting
6884218 democrats continue to miss the simple fact that hard working american families want real solutions to their pain at the pump and unlike federal bureaucrats dont have the luxury of requesting a four day work week
6884219 instead they have to take their children to school or practices and drive to work with the hopes of earning enough money to file their tank for next weeks commute americans deserve more than this part time democratic leadership has or is willing to give

6884228 while this talk is not new naturally there are reasons to be skeptical this is the type of equity market where rumors might surface because trading is thin and volumes are light and there is a greater chance for the stock to make a bullish move

6884254 those democrats have a problem with hard working americans getting ahead and want to take all our money and create a socialist utopia while they themselves are rich hypocrites
6884255 if you are a hillary clintonista if you really believe in her and support her as i do then you will stop making her go around the country and beg for your vote its time to grow up accept that she has been defeated and let hillary get back to work if you keep holding out demanding that hillary work for your vote you are part of the problem not the solution
6884256 i see stupid people theyre everywhere and they dont even know theyre stupid
6884257 hillary want to give you a gas price break the bitch
6884258 why do these people vote against their own interests its crazy

6884260 i see stupid people theyre everywhere and they dont even know theyre stupid
6884261 pschodrews post is dead on it pisses people off to hear the truth especially the unhinged fringe
6884262 its amusing and people read it so its in the paper but thats about it the idea that there is a best university in the country is scientific nonsense
6884263 all of this sounds plausible and then they weight each one of these things and score every city and rank them from first to last
6884264 but then the statisticians say ok not everyone agrees that climate is more important than health care and so lets see what would happen if we juggle how we weigh each issue
6884265 and just by changing the weights within plausible ranges they didnt zero anything out or make them negative the statisticians were able to make almost a third of the cities be first in the country and about another third or so ranked last in the country
6884266 and most amazingly there were about 50 out of 370 some odd cities that could be either first or last depending on how you judge weights
6884267 if you tell me what the criteria are and what methodology im going to use for ranking i guarantee absolutely guarantee i can construct a perfectly awful college that would be first in the country by that method
6884268 the information i have is if they are moving it s at a snail s pace
6884269 it s far too little far too slow it needs to increase

6884271 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies
6884272 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
6884273 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
6884274 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
6884275 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome
6884276 we were tired of having our families running around the country looking for answers from people who didnt have them
6884277 the more we talked the more we realized our boys had things in common that were not addressed in the literature
6884278 kyle knows that people dont understand xxyy and therefore dont understand him as a person she said
6884279 the study helps the world know why he is like he is it validates what he knows about himself and what we know about him when he cant follow directions its not because hes stupid

6884286 to say im pleased with the results is an understatement we were hoping for prices of up to 40 per cent lower than the current benchmark achieving around 50 per cent savings for the laptops is a phenomenal result this will really pave the way in helping our customers meet their savings targets

6884291 despite the global downturn flattening the growth of personal debt and uk gdp over the past few quarters debt levels continue to grow at a faster rate than the income the uk generates although there is no cause for panic as personal debt is well covered by the uk housing stock the figures clearly illustrate the continuing problem of growing personal debt levels in the uk if the property market and economy continue to weaken the current levels of personal debt will become unsustainable and there will be a marked increase in personal insolvencies

6884305 people who spend a lot of money on antiques also seem to spend a lot of money restoring their houses so i sort of got the whiff of opportunity just by talking to people in my antiques shop also there are too many antique dealers in edinburgh crowding the market so i was looking for an easier way to make a living
6884306 i mean i like them but because they take up so much room theyre so big and bulky im relieved to be rid of them once theyre sold i just want them out of the shop asap and the cash in my pocket selling them is easy for me unlike antiques i always loved antiques so i was always falling in love with the inventory i always wanted to hang on to my best stuff id always subconsciously price them too high in order to keep them from leaving the shop

6884730 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6884731 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6884765 when you are surrounded by a fleet of battleships all taking aim at you the possibility of a submarine is not really a problem
6884766 how can you be sure you dont infringe on someone elses patent
6884767 the fact is that these standards have known patent pools they are listed in the documents on the web sites even in the press releases
6884768 if youre limited to an executive summary flowchart of no more than 10 boxes that fit on one page youd be hard pressed to tell the differences between any of these codecs the differences are all in the details of course the details are very important
6884769 the claim that building on top of h 261 frees you from patent concerns and thats a reason to use h 261 over theora is dubious as theora is based on a codec of approximately the same age the truth is that as soon as you start trying to move forward using any of the discoveries published since then you immediately run into patent concerns again
6884770 part of the problem is that there is no legal test for unencumbered nor do you have to be infringing to get sued we will always have a halting problem here and yet both vorbis and theora are 10 years old with no claims against them would another 10 be sufficient twenty vague threats that come to nothing nothing that is except eliminating the monopoly interests competition are the story of my professional life patent law is being used to extort outright and most of the interests represented here are willingly buying into it this isnt even getting to the trolls and we sit around and wonder why this industry is so dysfunctional
6884771 we dont accept the stock answers on fud such as how can you ever be sure you arent violating a patent you can be sure by doing a taxonomy you dig into the process and ask questions

6884798 esta alza de los bonos fue una reacci n del mercado tras este anuncio y que podr a incidir en una baja en las expectativas de inflaci n a futuro
6884799 los t tulos subieron m s que nada por esta se al potente que se env a al mercado aunque por ahora se debe esperar a que se apruebe y materialice la medida tras esto se ver c mo afecta a la inflaci n
6884800 creemos asimismo que los anuncios conforman una muy buena y fina soluci n para enfrentar el problema del control inflacionario y dar un impulso al crecimiento econ mico en un marco de responsabilidad y austeridad fiscal aspecto que resulta necesario en un escenario internacional complicado como el de hoy
6884801 por parte de la empresa el proyecto sigue con su idea original nosotros hemos hablado con barrick y ellos nos han dicho que no son responsables de esas versiones y que tienen la idea en su directorio y de su presidente de seguir avanzando en la idea original que es llevar a cabo el proyecto como debe ser en ambas naciones
6884802 esto tiene un mont n de complejidades y entre ellas est el acuerdo impositivo que debe haber entre la empresa con ambos pa ses hay un problema ah que es el de los servicios transfronterizos que es c mo tributar cuando se triture del lado de chile y se procese del lado de argentina pero yo estoy seguro de que vamos a llegar a un buen acuerdo
6884803 lo del 80 que se ha dicho que est solicitando chile no es as el planteo es lo de los servicios transfronterizos
6884804 el ministro chileno est en toda su raz n de decirlo porque adem s es lo que necesitan como tambi n lo necesitamos nosotros es decir que haya mucho trabajo desarrollo actividad que significa progreso en cada uno de los pa ses ahora si eso pasara no ser a pascua lama ser a pascua solamente ya que lama es el lado argentino
6884805 lo mejor que puede pasar y es lo que la empresa nos ha transmitido a nosotros es seguir con el proyecto original y hacer todos los esfuerzos posibles para superar este problema impositivo que hay entre ambos pa ses yo aspiro a que el mes que viene est resuelto el tema eso ser a lo ideal todos los temas que estaban pendientes del lado de san juan est n pr cticamente resueltos incluidos los ambientales

6884816 doctors and other health care providers should not be forced to choose between good professional standing and violating their conscience
6884817 freedom of expression and action should not be surrendered upon the issuance of a health care degree
6884818 the bush administration and the department of health and human services are to be applauded for taking important steps to protect the freedom of conscience of physicians and other health care providers in the united states who find the wholesale termination of the lives of our preborn citizens to be unconscionable and reprehensible
6884819 as a society we should be encouraging conscience in our nations health care providers not seeking to coerce consciences against their wills

6885044 a book like the amazing remarkable monsieur leotard would have been good had only half of the effort gone into it but campbell and best have instead gone all out and created a comic masterpiece
6885045 with campbell you get the whole package not a page of the book gets wasted and theres something to entertain at every glance
6885046 campbells light touch with the art beautiful yet often disturbing watercolors proves supple and fluid enough to convey scenes of whimsy and scenes of horror this might just be my favorite campbell yet i cant recommend it highly enough
6885047 you will love rediscovering the joy of a wild adventure comic that you cant stop reading you will love laughing at each inevitable change of fortune that makes leotards life so amazing so remarkable you will love once again letting eddie and dan best take hold of your consciousness and imagination and turn them inside out and upside down on the wildest ride youll find in comics this year
6885048 campbells artwork meanwhile is beyond beauty his color work here crosses styles and genres and employs some brilliant panel placement as well

6885050 its a terrific piece and a sweet return to form for campbell

6885056 it was also crucial that those selections were made by the players themselves

6885104 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6885105 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6885106 mein sohn ist hochgradig allergisch gegen eier und eierprodukte da es aber viele sorten schokolade gibt wo so geringe mengen ei enthalten sind das der hersteller dies nicht auf der verpackung angeben muss suche ich nun mit eurer hilfe schokolade ohne ei
6885107 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6885108 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6885109 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6885110 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6885111 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6885112 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6885113 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6885114 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6885115 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6885116 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
6885117 trust yourself create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement
6885118 the real contest is always between what youve done and what youre capable of doing you measure yourself against yourself and nobody else
6885119 we have always said that the roles missions and size of the american forces here the coalition forces was based on the conditions on the ground and what is needed
6885120 will review the security situation in the country and if necessary will ask the american side for certain forces for training or supporting the iraqi security forces

6885130 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6885131 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6885132 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6885133 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6885134 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6885135 i would never disrespect a colleague and friend with that kind of language
6885136 its disappointing someone would intentionally misrepresent the hard work jenna and i are doing
6885137 the cover of her thesis for instance is inspired by celtic artwork and reflects the process of a systematic review parts become a whole the anthropomorphic human like and zoomorphic animal like creatures represent the background of the author the stethoscopes and the corners refer specifically to diagnostic test accuracy reviews the snakes eating their own tail stand in celtic mythology for longevity and the ever lasting life cycle
6885138 there are four runs attributed to ryder that are in the wrong place in both the batting section of the score and in the bowling section
6885139 there is no doubt that a recording error of some kind has occurred so where do these runs belong
6885140 it is all about the scoring an activity usually taken for granted

6885144 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6885145 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6885146 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6885147 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6885148 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6885149 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6885150 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6885151 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6885152 provoked riots among the audience and even the critics reviews were unusually violent and one of the critics suggested putting me in an asylum and keeping music paper out of my reach only six years later under oscar frieds direction it became a great success and since that time has not caused the anger of the audience
6885153 light will dawn for all others but i am all alone in my darkness
6885154 ele disse que tinha visto um suposto ladr o e tentou entrar para evitar que minha casa fosse roubada
6885155 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6885156 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6885157 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6885158 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6885159 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6885160 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6885161 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6885162 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6885163 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6885164 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6885165 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6885166 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6885167 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6885168 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6885169 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6885170 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6885171 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6885172 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6885173 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6885174 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6885175 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6885176 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6885177 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6885178 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6885179 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6885180 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6885181 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6885182 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6885183 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6885184 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

6885191 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6885192 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6885193 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6885194 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6885195 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6885196 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6885197 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6885198 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6885199 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6885200 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6885201 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6885202 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6885203 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6885204 right now weve got two energy policies in this country
6885205 one is war the other is drilling and neither one of them works
6885206 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
6885207 if you have a green party i want to join
6885208 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

6885225 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6885226 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

6885239 as a member of ica peter wagner actually caused many questions to come my way because of my membership there i will no longer be involved with that organization and actually have not tracked well with them and some of their agendas since i have been involved with them however i have enjoyed the many relationships i have developed from going to the annual meetings most all of those relationships are also disengaging from their affiliation with ica because of many issues beyond lakeland
6885240 i think that there is a chance that many may disassociate with the ica depending on todd continuing to reveal his deceptive doctrine and peter continuing to support such doctrine
6885241 he who began a good work in you is faithful to complete it
6885242 the occ is essentially saying that if banks cant trick or cheat consumers they wont be able to offer credit
6885243 it is outrageous that the federal regulator overseeing the banking industry is so out of step with the needs of millions of americans unfairly trapped in debt by abusive credit card practices
6885244 i have been meditating on this particular passage of scripture from 1kings 19 9 14 as of late
6885245 this indicates a need for safe operation around large trucks as the public motors down the highway
6885246 its things like driving in the blind spots following too closely passing with insufficient clearance
6885247 these are the primary factors that lead to truck crashes youve got to give them room to work youve got to create a cushion of safety around a large truck

6885290 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submittal of proposals in this competition
6885291 the reason were asking for that is since the issuance of the draft request for proposal rfp two weeks ago as weve engaged in our discussions with the pentagon and theyre asking for a different kind of airplane than they asked for in the first competition
6885292 if we dont get the sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres really little option for us other than to no bid in this competition
6885293 the proposal will have the specific timelines in it im not going to get into it now and whether or not a company desires to compete is entirely up to them
6885294 we have taken what the gao has told us what they have recommended for us to do which in the scheme of the overall proposal were relatively minor but important addressed all the concerns that the gao raised
6885295 it views any delay to the amended request for proposal for the tanker replacement program as harmful to the warfighter and that a delay will result in a direct escalation in cost to the government thereby harming american taxpayers

6885343 i thought we played ever so well at preston apart from a fifteen minute spell
6885344 we did not get the breaks which you tend not to when you are away from home we know we are a bit short on the striker situation obviously with clinton morrison going but we have just got to muck in there we are playing well and just need a goal to get us going and the lads have been very positive this week
6885345 i think it would be nice to score a goal it is two teams looking for their first win they have not got any points yet this season and despite losing to ipswich last weekend it was the ipswich goalkeeper who got man of the match which shows that they have been creating chances
6885346 they have invested over the summer spending in the region of 3 million and have purchased very good players and they will be desperate to get and push on themselves
6885347 in my eyes it is not a panic situation here after ten games you can get a realistic view of what you can expect from the rest of the season i am just taking my time even though we have not got a win we have been a whisker away from winning both
6885348 the biggest thing for me about the goals conceded was within the group we have to take individual responsibility to clear the lines
6885349 we havent done that and we have paid a heavy price we are not just laying everything at the door of the defence because ultimately it is a team thing and we need to defend all over the park they need to win the individual battles and then we wont be giving away the soft goals we have been
6885350 without making excuses every bit of bad luck that could come their way has happened so what you do is get back on the training ground work your socks off to put that right and hopefully you can translate that work into the game on saturday thats what well be looking to do this week
6885351 the players attitudes have been spot on and they want to go and win games for this football club and the supporters its been a horrible two weeks there is no getting away from that everybody knows the feeling we have for the club and how passionate we are about it
6885352 football is everything to us so it is hurtful when you dont achieve that result obviously as a manager you realise the impact that has on everybody thats not a responsibility to take lightly and i can assure everybody we hurt deeply with that
6885353 but again the only cure for that is hard work you do one of two things you either feel sorry for yourself or you go out and work hard to turn the corner which we will do
6885354 we will go to palace in good heart because we know we are capable of winning games in the championship we know it will be a tough fixture but we will make sure the lads are ready to give their best
6885355 whatever i have to say to get us to exchange fluids can we just pretend i already did that and we can move on
6885356 but im just really trying to get in your pants

6885363 the root cause of instability is the india pakistan conflict
6885364 for the first time in 60 years the u s has leverage in both india and pakistan
6885365 use its influence in those two countries to minimize tensions
6885366 thats because the u s has tended to look at its short term interests and successive pakistan governments have not made the people aware of the magnitude of this menace which is tearing the society apart
6885367 if pakistan fails it is a tragedy not just for pakistan but for the whole world

6885413 well ive been told i can shut it for a few minutes but everyone else is too hot
6885414 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6885415 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6885416 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone

6885421 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6885422 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6885423 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6885424 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6885425 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6885426 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6885427 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6885428 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6885429 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6885430 but he said this project really looked like it was doable

6885437 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6885438 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6885439 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6885440 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6885441 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6885442 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008

6885451 wir haben es geschafft diese frage ins scheinwerferlicht zu bringen
6885452 what convinces me about this is that people now are comfortable putting their photos onto the cloud
6885453 when you read about someones house catching on fire whats the first thing they try and save its the photos and the memories
6885454 and then go right up to small and medium business and then corporations

6885460 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6885461 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6885462 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6885463 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6885464 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6885465 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6885466 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6885467 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6885468 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6885469 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6885470 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6885471 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6885472 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6885473 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6885474 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6885475 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6885476 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6885477 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6885478 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6885479 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6885480 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6885481 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6885482 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6885483 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6885484 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6885485 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6885486 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6885487 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6885488 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6885489 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6885490 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6885491 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6885492 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6885493 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6885494 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6885495 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6885496 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6885497 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6885498 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6885499 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6885500 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6885501 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6885502 what this does is give them the ability on a daily basis to see what is going to be posted into their accounts
6885503 if a check is coming in that youre not familiar with youll be able to look at it and say this is not my check
6885504 while online services that help prevent check and ach automatic clearing house fraud have been available separately to larger businesses for some time this is the first time a bank has offered both of these services in a combined view to small and medium sized companies
6885505 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6885506 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6885507 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6885508 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6885509 tenemos que darnos cuenta de que a hipoxia no es un problema de los locales
6885510 es un problema global y tiene severas consecuencias para los ecosistemas
6885511 se est convirtiendo en un problema de tal magnitud que comienza a afectar los recursos que sacamos del mar para alimentarnos
6885512 si echamos a perder las corrientes de energ a dentro de nuestros sistemas podr amos terminar sin cangrejos sin camarones sin peces eso significa que las zonas muertas seguir n creciendo hasta que les parmos un alto
6885513 estoy seguro de que ellos definitivamente preferir an tener sus fertilizantes en la tierra m s que el que se vayan flotando por el r o
6885514 ha habido muchas reportadas pero en realidad hay muchas m s lo que ha pasado en los pa ses industrializados con los agronegocios es que han orillado al incremento en el uso de los nutrientes de los estuarios y los mares y ahora est sucediendo tambi n en los pa ses en v as de desarrollo
6885515 i think they are going to it way too many times
6885516 you cant help but have admiration and respect for the guy
6885517 by the time they get to the convention in st paul there might not be much of it left to use
6885518 its a head spinning non sequitur designed to distract us from something mildly troubling with the assertion of something impressive
6885519 it does seem like theyre flirting with giuliani 9 11 territory here
6885520 in which a subject that seems utterly immune to humor used as a first resort suddenly becomes a running joke among your political enemies and your late night comic friends

6885522 then buy consumer electronics that are super high end and built to last
6885523 not necessarily be a household name when it comes to american patriots novelist and screenwriter dalton trumbo earned the title
6885524 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6885525 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6885526 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6885527 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6885528 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6885529 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6885530 one of the illusions of life is that the present hour is not the critical decisive hour write it on your heart that every day is the best day of the year
6885531 no stop this story is so boring it makes me want to rip my head off and throw it out the window life is too short
6885532 oh really hmm you dont say what do you know so when did you first notice your watch wasnt keeping good time
6885533 dave this is dr howard j buzzkillerton he was just telling me about a new type of moth that caused quite a bit of controversy apparently at the annual meeting of the society of lepidopterists and entomologists in brussels last fall and by the way he also collects rare old jazz records or sides as he calls them youre into vinyl right dave
6885534 uh well uh nice to meet you uh dr buzzkillerton
6885535 our take home message today is the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no mystery it did not collapse from explosives or fuel oil fires
6885536 we do not expect that his participation at the olympics even if he does well will cause a tidal wave of other gay athletes outing themselves
6885537 each athlete has his or her own set of unique circumstances be they family team or sports it might be easier for some to come out and more difficult for others
6885538 we know of many other gay athletes who have not come out and openly said that they are gay some of them have said so to team mates or friends but their sexual orientation is not yet out in the public domain
6885539 society thinks that many women who play certain types of sport are lesbians anyway it is like a default setting
6885540 woman are also in a supportive environment it is more accepted there and they make no big thing of it
6885541 were both gay divers but thats about the only similarity two things we share out of thousands of millions of qualities and character traits
6885542 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6885543 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6885544 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6885545 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6885546 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6885547 if it is not handled properly we could have a security issue
6885548 you dont want to give anybody a reason to turn back to al qaeda
6885549 some people from the government encouraged us to fight against al qaeda but it seems that now that al qaeda is finished they dont want us anymore
6885550 sacrificed and fought against al qaeda and now the government wants to catch them and arrest them
6885551 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
6885552 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

6885561 i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
6885562 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
6885563 i can get him information that i believe is better than what he would get as president
6885564 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
6885565 yes weve got to find solutions we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
6885566 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games

6885577 because of the potential margin contribution services represent to the business
6885578 in recessionary times that says something about the importance of services to best buy that has focused its entire business around customer centricity
6885579 services in general would be a higher margin business which is why its attractive to begin with
6885580 most purchases supported by these types of services are made from retailers with a wide variety of products
6885581 more than likely they would still go back to the store retailer to get help as a starting point
6885582 we have a large and established customer base there is no doubt in our minds that microsoft is going after this space very aggressively but we feel very strong and confident
6885583 this is a logical extension of the investment that weve had in the development space for decades
6885584 total suppression costs are projected to reach 1 6 billion in fy 2008 appropriated suppression funds total 1 2 billion at this time the only option for financing the shortfall is to use the agencys transfer authority
6885585 the short explanation for the forest services current jam is that insufficient funds are appropriated each year for wildfire suppression fire funding is fast approaching 50 percent of the agencys budget by the time the agency uses the 1 9 billion this year it will have increased its fire suppression budget by 59 5 percent over last year the increase comes as a response to a variety of factors that include a longer fire season due to climate change an increase in the number of people who reside in wildfire prone areas hazardous fuel build up and a budgetary process that bases wildfire suppression funding on a 10 year average cost thats an average cost that continues to climb as the budget remains limited
6885586 well try to attach this to any moving spending vehicle as soon as congress comes back into session
6885587 we firmly believe that this fiscal mess is a result of the fiscal mismanagement of the fire program by the forest service
6885588 provide a supplemental funding source for catastrophic emergency wildland fire suppression activities on department of the interior and national forest system lands to require the secretary of the interior and the secretary of agriculture to develop a cohesive wildland fire management strategy and for other purposes
6885589 while the idea national fire service may sound attractive concerns are that another fema would be created and do more harm than good we would like to see some simple cost effective changes made in the way the agencies do business both with respect to firefighter pay and benefits and the organizational structure of the fire program management before efforts are made to create a new agency a key element to those changes would be to get the line officers regional foresters forest supervisors and district rangers and those that manage the fire program but have little to no fire experience or expertise out of the fire mix and eliminate their control over fire budgets fire program policy must move into the 21st century and be developed and implemented by those with fire experience and expertise the fire dollars also should be handled and allocated by fire folks not line officers who have no clue on how to run manage a fire department
6885590 fortunately congress is starting to listen and understand that a stronger more cost effective efficient land management agency fire program is attainable with or without the help support of those agencies however congress must act now to make such changes

6885600 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
6885601 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
6885602 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
6885603 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
6885604 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
6885605 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
6885606 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
6885607 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
6885608 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react

6885630 we are indeed distressed that our previous analysis of this issue was in error
6885631 it is the dedication of board officials such as those at the butler county board of elections who went above and beyond the call of duty that gives me confidence that preparation with our local partners will lead to a successful november election
6885632 now that what appears to be the root cause for this voting tabulation error has been identified we will prepare ohios counties using the premier voting system software with instructions for following strict protocols needed to identify and correct this error if it occurs
6885633 we will continue to monitor the situation and provide boards of elections with the instruction and support they need to ensure an orderly and efficient election and an accurate count of ohioans votes

6885656 if our middle class prospers our state and nation are stronger
6885657 the bush economic policies have given enormous breaks to the superwealthy and big corporations and they have been disastrous for maine my plan focuses meaningful tax cuts to help hard working people like casey and sheri harris raise their children and earn a decent living
6885658 we all recognize that our economy is on the wrong track strengthening maines middle class will go a long way to ensuring our overall economy is stronger
6885659 we need a bold plan to do that and i have one
6885660 if we are going to strengthen our middle class we must make sure they arent burdened by the amt
6885661 even more middle class families will be hit by amt if congress doesnt act to fix the problem
6885662 my plan extends for two years stopping the amt from hitting millions of additional taxpayers until congress acts to fix it permanently
6885663 so many of our seniors have a significant property tax burden but do not itemize

6885672 were seeing significant progress in iraq through the surge and while there are still significant problems i think this helps me in his quest to retake his lost seat
6885673 there needs to be an increased nato presence in afghanistan
6885674 well probably need a surge of troops there but it shouldnt just be our troops
6885675 that would amount to the largest tax increase in the history of this country
6885676 doing these things would help bring down costs without going to a government run system
6885677 i also got an earmarked passed for night vision goggles for our troops in iraq

6885684 we are way beyond what the state could and should be doing for our kids
6885685 we are shooting for 80 percent of our kids to be competent in algebra i before high school
6885686 they will be the first class to have benefited from the integrated math program all three years
6885687 the school has been losing money on them for several years last year you needed 3 000 from your general fund to cover the costs
6885688 the picnic was incredibly well received especially for new families and parents
6885689 i dont scare easy i was in the army and world war ii so when something like this happens it doesnt matter to me
6885690 why do women shave their legs and not their arms when their arms are more visible
6885691 we found out that wall street has been king of a nudist beach
6885692 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6885693 what well see is failures where the bankers were dumb in what they did
6885694 in retrospect i was wrong to partially sell the holdings
6885695 the only way to get somebody who agrees with you 100 percent is to run yourself and i have no interest in that
6885696 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6885697 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6885698 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6885699 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6885700 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6885701 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6885702 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6885703 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6885704 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6885705 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6885706 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights

6885843 greenland is the most outstanding example of whats been happening due to global warming
6885844 death rates were around 50 80 per 100 000 in june july and august winter while they were around 30 50 per 100 000 in the rest of the year including the summer
6885845 it is understandable that more deaths would occur in winters in cold or temperate regions but even in a subtropical region as indicated in this study a decrease in temperatures in winters may increase human mortality
6885846 cold related deaths are far more numerous than heat related deaths in the united states europe and almost all countries outside the tropics and almost all of them are due to common illnesses that are increased by cold
6885847 since heat related deaths are generally much fewer than cold related deaths
6885848 the overall effect of global warming on health can be expected to be a beneficial one
6885849 the rise in temperature of 3 6 f expected over the next 50 years would increase heat related deaths in britain by about 2 000 but reduce cold related deaths by about 20 000

6886244 four million dollars i dont remember how much i made last year but im pretty sure it wasnt four million dollars i think
6886245 its just so hard to choose between the guy with a single two million dollar mansion and the guy with six or seven half million dollar houses
6886246 mccain owns six or seven houses right so that means hes losing even more money than most people with this housing bust

6886279 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6886280 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6886281 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder

6886291 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
6886292 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6886293 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
6886294 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6886295 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6886296 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6886297 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6886298 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6886299 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois

6886302 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6886303 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6886304 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6886305 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6886306 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6886307 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6886308 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6886309 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6886310 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6886311 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6886312 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6886313 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6886314 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
6886315 the 4 1 2 year military strategy failed because it was a poorly planned amp poorly executed

6886323 in these times of high gasoline prices i believe the federal government should do all it can to ensure that federal agencies and departments are appropriately reducing gasoline consumption this goal can be accomplished with the adoption of personnel policies to limit unnecessary commuting

6886325 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
6886326 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
6886327 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6886328 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6886329 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6886330 you cannot expect to create a few web pages and expect that web site to rank well in the search engines especially google
6886331 were always evaluating whats happening in the marketplace and certainly something thats happening in the last couple of months is that sonys managed to sell some boxes

6886342 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6886343 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6886344 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6886345 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6886346 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6886347 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6886348 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr

6886350 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6886351 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6886352 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6886353 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6886354 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6886355 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6886356 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6886357 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6886358 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6886359 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6886360 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6886361 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6886362 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6886363 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6886364 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6886365 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6886366 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6886367 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6886368 a swiss ski resort announced it would combat global warming by wrapping its mountain glaciers in aluminum foil to keep them from melting

6886371 im just a guy off the streets who attends a lot of council meetings blogs calls radio takes out public access tv shows whatever i can do to notify people
6886372 yeah i admire you for that because conceptually and fundamentally these programs are a great idea and who can argue with them for what they propose but i am concerned the money for these programs gets wasted and doesnt make it into the areas where it is needed
6886373 these programs are ineffective because people are scared to take action
6886374 you have to start young and get to them before the intervention stage
6886375 even if you are ready and aimed the people on the front lines are too scared to get out of their seats to fire

6886380 how do you know someone is a friend you know because they stand up and defend you when it is hard when hispanics needed a friend in congress during the immigration debate who stood up who spoke out john mccain
6886381 sen mccain worked with republicans and democrats alike to form immigration legislation and while the bill didnt pass only mccain demonstrated a real commitment to reforming immigration in a way that honored our laws as well as our immigrants and traditions
6886382 and barack obama obama did not stand up obama did not speak out and when the time came for him to do the right thing he did not
6886383 obama supported measures designed to insert a deadly poison pill to kill the immigration legislation if obama didnt even have the courage to stand up for immigrants how can he claim to have the strength to change the way washington works john mccain is ready to lead barack obama is not
6886384 of the seven states including alaska georgia montana north carolina north dakota florida and virginia are considered key battlegrounds this year obamas decision to stop advertising in those states is raising eyebrows aides to obama told fox news that the changes are related to the convention next week but they wouldnt discuss the specifics of their ad strategy
6886385 obamas support among voters between the ages of 18 and 29 which had been one of his strengths slipped 12 percentage points to 52 percent mccain who will turn 72 next week was winning 40 percent of younger voters

6886393 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6886394 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6886395 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6886396 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo

6886399 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6886400 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6886401 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6886402 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6886403 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6886404 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6886405 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6886406 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6886407 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6886408 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6886409 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6886410 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6886411 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6886412 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6886413 integrated into a mainstream investment process in a way that enhances profitability
6886414 an inconvenient truth the planetary emergency of global warming and what we can do about it
6886415 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6886416 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6886417 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6886418 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6886419 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6886420 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6886421 mr president i would hope your new initiatives could be carried out without an increase in u s troops in iraq because of concerns in congress and across the country about sending more u s military personnel there but if you are going to make that decision you should send whatever number you believe is right not a watered down compromise number because this could be the last real chance to win americans support for a strategy to stabilize iraq
6886422 all kinds of things are going on that are pushing people into this slow food place
6886423 we dont want the slow food movement to be about celebrity chefs and fancy restaurants
6886424 this is something very new for a lot of people in the mainstream
6886425 this food gets lumped into its only for the people who want to pay the price
6886426 but you know people are willing to pay it on nike shoes and cell phones and god knows what else theyll pay it on
6886427 they dont see that if you dont pay up front you pay out back youre going to pay in your health and in the loss of your culture and in the pleasure of your life
6886428 for me it means really bringing people to those difficult ideas of biodiversity and sustainability through the pleasure of the table
6886429 you dont need the rhetoric you just need the plate of food
6886430 it cant really be defined by the number of people giving their money
6886431 but there are many many people engaged in this kind of thinking and thats what really counts
6886432 back then in the clinton years i just felt like a lone voice but now people are talking about this idea of a vegetable garden on the white house lawn
6886433 its the symbolism of it its stewardship caring about what people eat
6886434 dr mmarna om shopping lyx och frilansjobb tankarna om vardagen och livet som r
6886435 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6886436 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6886437 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6886438 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6886439 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6886440 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6886441 there are still many voters who are in the process of understanding it its counter intuitive to many of us
6886442 hell no i like living on rock in earthquake country
6886443 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
6886444 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
6886445 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
6886446 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
6886447 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
6886448 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
6886449 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
6886450 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
6886451 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6886452 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6886453 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6886454 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6886455 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6886456 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6886457 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6886458 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6886459 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6886460 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6886461 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6886462 people realize they need to get more skills and get jobs that require skills and make an ongoing living that will be a good living
6886463 it has a funnel at one end the ducks go in they swim around they eat corn and they cant figure out how to get out and after its finished we go get them and band them
6886464 well use this information to first and foremost to determine survival rates of the ducks
6886465 that is what percentage of the ducks that we capture actually live from one year to the next and what percentage will die and the cause of death
6886466 this information has been helpful because that allows us to spend money to purchase national wildlife refuges in the correct spots to give water fowl a resting spot during the winter
6886467 that lets us set up proper hunting regulations proper season length and bag limit so that we can have perpetually good hunting in the future

6886471 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6886472 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6886473 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6886474 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6886475 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6886476 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6886477 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6886478 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6886479 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6886480 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6886481 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6886482 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6886483 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6886484 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6886485 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6886486 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6886487 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6886488 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6886489 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6886490 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6886491 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6886492 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6886493 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6886494 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6886495 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6886496 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6886497 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6886498 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6886499 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6886500 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6886501 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6886502 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6886503 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6886504 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6886505 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6886506 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6886507 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6886508 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6886509 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6886510 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6886511 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6886512 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6886513 we are very pleased extend our partnership with first endurance they are leaders in their field which fits very well with the north america sports philosophy

6886521 we want to acknowledge the contribution that the community and the volunteers have made to our event over the past ten years it is our hope that when we return to pcb for our tenth race in 2008 that the lions den will be open and available to the children who are patients of the hospital

6886537 mccain only had one house for 5 and a half years a prison
6886538 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6886539 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6886540 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6886541 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6886542 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6886543 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6886544 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6886545 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6886546 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6886547 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6886548 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6886549 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6886550 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6886551 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6886552 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6886553 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6886554 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6886555 they found the hooka water bong in my place and got charged with paraphernalia when the fire n police arrived when the fire happened
6886556 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record

6886565 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6886566 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6886567 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6886568 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6886569 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6886570 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6886571 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6886572 a small ceiling fan a tube light and a gigantic mirror on a wall
6886573 wed then have no problem to accept the other person as also an image of god

6886576 i called to let you know im in the office with no kids getting things ready for sunday i thought id let you know incase you wanted to get your stuff done but im only here for another hour or so as i have to pick daughter up
6886577 im on my way right now see you in twenty
6886578 a large fraction of americans know that we need a jeffersonian political revolution to fix our corrupt system they were not fooled by the obama rhetoric about change not from someone that has been a product of and servant for the two party plutocracy yes all the votes for me and the other third party presidential candidates spelled the difference between obama winning and losing our voters correctly protested against the corrupt two party system they did not elect mccain only those who voted for mccain elected him and that is something they must live with as they watch a mccain administration continue dismantling american democracy and budget busting global warmongering
6886579 it is time to stop saying god bless america and begin repeating god save america the good news is that we will build even greater public support for a true political revolution during the mccain presidency all too often things must get much worse before they can get better they will get worse

6886583 the chief impression that a study of the atonement leaves with us is that of the many sidedness of christs work for men when he died for us on the cross he did something so infinitely wonderful that it is impossible to comprehend it in its fulness however mans need be understood that need is fully and abundantly met in christ the new testament writers are like men who ransack their vocabulary to find words which will bring out some small fraction of the mighty thing that god has done for us and yet though it is so complex and so difficult it may be put very simply the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me gal 2 20

6886837 barack obama is more similarly situated to bill clinton in 1992 than any other candidate in recent history
6886838 bill clinton was a new candidate on the national scene he was running in a change oriented election cycle and the economy was voters top issue a dynamic he was able to capitalize on
6886839 nu stiu sa scriu si ce as mai scrie mai bine mi aplec inima sa si lase amprenta aici pe h rtie
6886840 traiesc cu sentimentul ca pot triumfa in multe domenii si ca pot deveni un om marcant al istoriei ce o vor citi nepotii mei insa lenea ma impinge sa traiesc viata unui simplu muritor dar am de gand sa schimb asta
6886841 hes willing to pay a price said coach brian riley as part of his all around game omilusik minds his defensive duties and is willing to block shots he killed penalties and added more and more time on the power play as the season went along
6886842 i think hes a kid that we are definitely counting on even though hes a sophomore to come in and play more like a junior or senior for us he would be the first to say that he would accept that role and looks forward to being in a key role for us he has a lot of upside and valuable tools that will make him a good player for us
6886843 at amp t is taking that expertise to a whole new level with robust in home tech support and with the same great customer service and reliability weve delivered for more than a century
6886844 have led to legal actions for lost laptops inappropriate videotapes and sensitive personal photos
6886845 because of the potential margin contribution services represent to the business
6886846 in recessionary times that says something about the importance of services to best buy that has focused its entire business around customer centricity
6886847 services in general would be a higher margin business which is why its attractive to begin with
6886848 most purchases supported by these types of services are made from retailers with a wide variety of products
6886849 more than likely they would still go back to the store retailer to get help as a starting point
6886850 i think the market is trying to establish maybe a short term bottom but struggling to do so
6886851 we will continue to aggressively investigate wrongdoing in the marketing and sale of auction rate securities
6886852 so what i need to do is re create my 4 second clip to a 4 5 second clip so when i hook it up with my other clip that will be 4 5 seconds long the handles will be those parts of my clips thats blank
6886853 the flow is increasing as dramatically as it is because it is operating in a condition of impunity
6886854 the failure of the venezuelan government to go after this is a failure to be serious
6886855 frankly this has gotten to the point where theyre playing games
6886856 usually drugs is beyond a lot of other political differences we have a cooperative relationship with cuba
6886857 there just has been no willingness to establish that cooperation or re establish a working relationship
6886858 the government needs to do something it doesnt have to have a meeting with me
6886859 the olympic games have been fantastic to watch over the past two weeks and it is amazing that we are doing so well
6886860 reading should be proud of its olympic athletes zacs performance with his partner mark in the lightweight double sculls was phenomenal who knows in four years time we could be welcoming more local athletes back here as gold medal heroes
6886861 what is the approach for customizing processes data and user interfaces
6886862 targeting the highest maturity level is not necessarily the best fit for every vendor
6886863 theres nothing to do in lively if youre not talking to someone
6886864 dad these guys look like lego men but dont do anything
6886865 nd life because my observation was that 80 of the people there hung about in bars or tried on new clothes and i dont know how many of those stay long term but i suspect thats where the higher dropout rates come from
6886866 warriors please note that there has been a change of venue in ft worth tx on september 18th the show has been moved from ridgelea theatre to lolas
6886867 this one was a good one because its a gut buster on the way up and im pleased to see that people are daunted by the hills
6886868 we have some really good regulars that come out all of the time and they are always here they never miss a week and they love it
6886869 i want to do some more trail runs and i want to do some more runs where i am trying really hard and gutting it pretty hard this is a good opportunity to come out and put in a good effort
6886870 you cant just build up to a fast pace and keep it you have to vary the pace its a good workout
6886871 this is my first time so my expectations arent that high but it would be nice to do it in an hour and 20 minutes
6886872 i do it all of the time and its got great downhill on it
6886873 you cant have a trail run without some up hills so there is a couple of big hills but not that many so i think it will be fun a lot of people might go oh running season is way over but for some of us running season never ends
6886874 i just think it is a fun way of sort of recognizing and celebrating all of the people who just enjoy trail running as much as i do
6886875 i just love that people really like it and have come to rely on it so i think it would be fun
6886876 my recent remarks may have been mistakenly construed as a call to rescind the colorado river compact and commence negotiations for new water allocations
6886877 let me be clear that i do not advocate renegotiation of the compact
6886878 i think the word renegotiate does not have double meaning
6886879 it is about opening it up and negotiating it again and the fact that hes willing to do that again has to demonstrate in my mind given the context of it a bias for the lower basin states
6886880 this is a reversal of direction but its a reversal that i think colorado voters have to pay clear attention to because on the west slope im not sure there are more important issues than the issue of the scarcity of water
6886881 wicker has a very powerful ally his name is jim greenlee and he is a prior donor to wickers congressional campaign
6886882 curiously greenlee neglected to note his position when he made the donation he is the u s attorney appointed by president bush in northern mississippi but as the campaign season opens in earnest it seems that no one is providing wickers campaign with more valuable support than greenlee
6886883 washington pundits anticipate significant democratic pick ups in the upcoming senate races in which a largely republican class faces a hostile electorate one of the surprising vulnerabilities for the republicans is in mississippi senator trent lott resigned his seat before his term expired with his resignation closely linked in time to the announcement of charges against his brother in law dickie scruggs to fill out the remaining year of lotts term governor hailey barbour tapped roger wicker who is now seeking to win the seat in his own right hes being challenged by former governor ronnie musgrove who is given strong odds at picking off the seat for the democrats
6886884 the creators finally delivered a season where they kept the cutesies under control
6886885 with lots of old favorite characters showing up and joining in a big big story a little more continuity between episodes would have sold the arc better but overall this old comic fan found lots to enjoy
6886886 we dont know why but between 1 and 3 percent of all fetuses will manifest a cpc at 16 to 24 weeks of pregnancy
6886887 i am not aware of a single instance where a cpc caused damage to a fetus
6886888 thats one very important fact cpcs are not harmful and they nearly always go away by the third trimester of pregnancy
6886889 stop promoting a lifestyle that is not only unhealthy but is also illegal in 48 states
6886890 n o acreditamos nisso em hip tese nenhuma quem pensa desta forma est muito enganado o fato do sport ter ganho a copa do brasil n o significa que essa equipe seja melhor ou pior que os outros
6886891 na rodada passada eu acompanhei o empate deles com o vit ria 0 a 0 e acredito que qualquer equipe poderia ter vencido o jogo contra o botafogo eles fizeram um jogo equilibrado e perderam o campeonato muito igual
6886892 vou enfrentar esse advers rio pela terceira vez no ano anteriormente defendia o botafogo e o santos neste brasileiro o sport tem uma equipe inteligente a fei o de seu treinador um time encardido
6886893 pela situa o que estamos precisamos tentar vencer independentemente do local a vantagem de jogar em casa pequena
6886894 o evento foi um sucesso mobilizou a cidade inteira foi a grande oportunidade que os amazonenses tiveram de ver como funciona um carro de corridas fiquei muito contente com tudo
6886895 the good that has come out of that is that the shock one can only imagine the shock seems to have brought him to his senses
6886896 it has become clear that my call has gone largely unanswered
6886897 the ny times reports that kate stoeckle and louisa strauss who graduated this year from the trinity school in manhattan took on a freelance science project to check 60 samples of seafood using a simplified genetic fingerprinting technique called dna bar coding to see whether the fish new yorkers buy is what they think they are getting and found that a piece of sushi sold as the luxury treat white tuna turned out to be mozambique tilapia a much cheaper fish that is often raised by farming roe supposedly from flying fish was actually from smelt
6886898 seven of nine samples that were called red snapper were mislabeled and they turned out to be anything from atlantic cod to acadian redfish an endangered species

6886932 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6886933 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6886934 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6886935 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details

6886940 the 2010 fifa world cup needs to guarantee the improvement of life for people living in johannesburg
6886941 the fifa confederations cup is not a test event in that it is something we can fail at it is more to refine the processes procedures and plans we have in place ke nako it is our time
6886942 its an honor to be here and its pretty cool
6886943 its special very special you go into every tournament and you have to think have you a chance to win youre not just playing to make the cut or playing to do this youre playing to win and i was i saw myself being here but im still very excited
6886944 ive just been taking one hole at a time just been hoofing along with my dad who is on the bag just hitting great shots and just having fun out there and whatever happens happens its led us this far and so hopefully it continues

6886948 this closing was driven by our ongoing global asset utilization process which identified the opportunity to shift our production to other o i north american facilities resulting in lower energy consumption and production costs while still meeting current and anticipated market needs
6886949 the researchers interviewed each subject twice one week apart each time the participants were first asked if they were pro con or undecided about the expansion
6886950 they then were asked to answer questions about their beliefs on environmental political economic and other consequences of the enlargement of the base
6886951 in which they were asked to categorize pictures of the base and positive and negative words as quickly as possible
6886952 significantly predicted their conscious beliefs and preferences as expressed in the second round

6886954 it cant give answers to all questions but it could certainly help pollsters to get more information than people now share
6886955 i havent dealt with very much disappointment in my career ive been fortunate
6886956 the feeling of getting passed by six guys i never lose to was devastating i wanted to disappear
6886957 i put a lot of pressure on myself every time i line up though im always very nervous i was very nervous today i prepared well raced well all season went low in my preliminaries didnt burn out im not exhausted im getting enough sleep ive been eating well
6886958 i have no explanation all i have is an apology im sorry and i hate watching people apologize after bad performances but i understand now why they do because there was a lot of expectations back home and i always talk about how great performances by canadian athletes can be inspiring and motivating and i didnt contribute to that at all
6886959 hitting the wall is one thing being really tired is one thing
6886960 but watching guys i never lose to go by me the first thing that went through my mind was what have i done
6886961 ill learn from it but ive also got to respect the fact that ive done a lot better than this throughout my career this was a huge exception i dont die i dont come in eighth i was almost ninth pretty much came in last ive never come in ninth im not talking the last four years the last two i mean ever
6886962 thats why after all these years we still run the race
6886963 i think at the end of the day you see world champion tyson gay not even make the 100 final asafa powell finish fifth the americans drop the baton its the olympics and you have to bring your best
6886964 were disappointed right now but to come here and make the final something we havent done in 12 years athletics canada said finish top 6 so i dont know if someones clairvoyant over there but this is what we came here to do
6886965 ive just got to look back and respect the fact that i know ive got it within me and ive done it before
6886966 but theres worse places he could be than at the olympic games
6886967 only in greater wingnuttia could making a really really shitty movie be portrayed as an act of heroism
6886968 ironically zucker could have made a fifth scary movie installment without anyone raising a single question about his sanity character career choices or funny bone
6886969 scary movie 4 finds horror parody overshadowed by ho hum groin blows c list celebrity cameos slapstick child abuse soon to be forgotten hip hop personalities plus scatalogical and gay jokes

6886971 i wish there was some insider information i could give you but
6886972 made of earth friendly earth this biodegradable adobe building will slowly melt back into the landscape once the looters have removed the merchandise
6886973 we are excited about the chance to take our team to the central part of the state to promote the sport statewide to young girls playing the game while also reaching out to new fans
6886974 we know we have great fans across the state who support our program and we wanted to give them a chance to watch us in person we also have great respect for coach carol russell and her program at nebraska kearney so we are hoping for a great environment at the heartland events center
6886975 we are thrilled about the opportunity to partner with the heartland events center in taking this special event to our fans in central nebraska
6886976 we know that the heartland events center is going to provide a first class environment for the game and we are hoping for a packed house for the event
6886977 people in grand island and the surrounding area are hungry for more sporting events and we hope this will be the first of many events coming to the heartland events center
6886978 we hope husker fans and loper fans alike come to grand island to support their teams and help create a great atmosphere for the game
6886979 we wanted to get a good go at practice because we have a situational practice this afternoon so this morning was important
6886980 their two corners fryar and e j biggers are really talented kids
6886981 their safeties c j wilson and louis delmas are good players and in that scheme of defense in terms of the front and how that relates to the back end the safeties are key components they very much have our attention and our respect
6886982 im really impressed with their two ends i think even though there will be some new people in the middle of their defensive line theyre still well coached and a good unit the linebackers are probably the most underrated group in their defense because they allow the other people to play theyve been well coached and thats why theyve had the success theyve had
6886983 well make some decisions going into next week as to how well go with those
6886984 coach ted gilmore and i havent finalized those things nate swift and todd peterson obviously are going out there as starters paul youll see a lot of menelik holt were still trying to find the rest of the combinations were going to try and prep two or three other guys were going to evaluate that through today and tomorrow
6886985 he most certainly thrust himself into the middle of the internal politics of the court that centered on this very case
6886986 last year our schedule was the most challenging in school history and it allowed us to finish with one of the best rpis and strength of schedules in school history
6886987 we think our schedule this season has a chance to be even better than last year and our fans at the devaney center should be treated to some of the best action in college basketball night in and night out
6886988 we are excited about the chance to take our team to the central part of the state
6886989 we know we have great fans across the state who support our program and we wanted to give them a chance to watch us in person we also have great respect for coach carol russell and her program at nebraska kearney so we are hoping for a great environment at the heartland events center
6886990 our non conference schedule is definitely going to prepare us for the big 12
6886991 i cant imagine too many other teams in the country who are willing to take on the challenge of potentially playing six of their final eight non conference games against teams that went to last years ncaa tournament in basically a one month stretch we will play five conference champions from a year ago that is the kind of schedule you will face if you want to make a run in the ncaa tournament the amazing thing is that the big 12 schedule will probably be more challenging than our non conference schedule
6886992 from top to bottom the big 12 will be one of the best conferences in the nation
6886993 we open against two of the traditional powers in college basketball against oklahoma and at texas and then the schedule just seems to be one great game after another
6886994 in his most extensive interview since the defcon controversy emerged
6886995 i am very pleased to have terrel back on our basketball team
6886996 he has proven to me this summer that he is doing whatever it takes to be a part
6886997 if i am a star the people made me a star no studio no person but the people did
6886998 damn i bet it would be really cool to get high to tony bennett
6886999 i am very pleased to have terrel back on our basketball team
6887000 he has proven to me this summer that he is doing whatever it takes to be a part of this program he has had a very productive summer and is making himself a better person both on and off the court hopefully he will make the most of his second opportunity
6887001 shows that there is a lot of further value creation potential in metso
6887002 in addition the board and management have decided to seek other value enhancing opportunities
6887003 everybody wants to come back to a reunion thats what princetons made up of people coming back to reunions
6887004 anytime there is a webmaster show there is nothing i look forward to more than the porn poker tour
6887005 aside from the great chats with fellow webmasters flowing drinks and some great competition the sponsors always manage to award great prizes to the winners
6887006 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year
6887007 so that the ink does not spread or ball up even though it is still in a quasi fluid state
6887008 by l amp ps repeated efforts to conflate substantially cure and simply cure
6887009 the difference between substantial cure and full cure is not insubstantial
6887010 the 823 patent teaches that if a uv radiation source is passed over the ink at a slower speed and or multiple times the degree to which the ink is cured will increase one of ordinary skill in the art reading this disclosure could only conclude that more passes and or a slower carriage speed would result in an inceasing degree of cure albeit not linearly increasing
6887011 si pues a veces me llaman y me preguntan el perfil de la gente que va a vivir ah algo que es bien dificil de r esponder ya que s lo vendo los departamentos que hago pero en fin no es un tema de discriminaci n sino que creo que a la gente le interesa saber sobre las costumbres que tienen los futuros inquilinos creo que cuando les das el precio se dan una idea
6887012 there shall be no more pain for the former things have passed away
6887013 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6887014 a settembre mi cerco lavoro perch a giugno ci si prepara mentalmente allestate a luglio neanche a parlarne che il mese dopo agosto isomma decidiamo tutto a settembre
6887015 financial firms speculating for their clients or for themselves account for about 81 percent of the oil contracts on the nymex a far bigger share than had previously been reported by the agency
6887016 financial speculation did play a significant part in the rapid increase in oil prices
6887017 these two actions in combination would provide a powerful signal to speculators and world oil markets that will help alleviate the current upward pressure on prices and help american families
6887018 if h r 6346 or any similar price control bill were presented to the president his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill
6887019 the administration is strongly opposed to h r 6604 which offers poorly targeted short term measures that do nothing to address the fundamentals of supply and demand that bear the primary responsibility for current high energy prices
6887020 this incentive program will make it more economically feasible for u s auto manufacturers and part suppliers to retool their facilities by providing low interest credit
6887021 the federal government must be a strong partner in the investment in the advanced technologies
6887022 i think the rally weve had over the last couple of days explains it
6887023 excuse me yes hi mam im going to need as many of these cute little guys as it would take to make a comfortably fitting coat im a 38 regular
6887024 i love hugs and i love kisses but what id really love is help with the dishes
6887025 the last refinery built in brazil dates to 1980 between now and 2017 five new refineries will be built in this country
6887026 the coro transaction represents a strategic investment in a company with a proven management team working in two countries where we have political confidence chile and argentina and a commodity copper which we believe has strong fundamentals going forward
6887027 he jammed his hind end and we had to stop on him
6887028 nothing that needed surgery fortunately the synthetic tracks will do that they can be really hard on the hind end
6887029 we are continuing to watch things closely of course because there is continuing weakness in the u s economy which has a slow effect on the canadian economy particularly on manufacturers exporters and the auto sector
6887030 we were slightly negative but only slightly negative for the first quarter so we will see the numbers when they come out at the end of next week
6887031 every single version of the bill was neutral on roe each one affected only babies already born not ones in the womb
6887032 essentially adding an additional doctor who then has to be called in an emergency situation to come in and make these assessments is really designed simply to burden the original decision of the woman and the physician to induce labor and perform an abortion
6887033 are you suggesting barack obama wants babies to die ive never thought the republicans would go this far this is about as low as you can go
6887034 ive seen it rain for three weeks at harvest time and ive seen us have a harvest that we never stopped turning a wheel until the last kernel was in the bin
6887035 the weather is just something that has really been unpredictable
6887036 there isnt a soul in the world who believes that will be the final and highest number youre going to see all year
6887037 youve got freedom to put as much sales on the books as you can and to be aggressive

6887044 qui con la vita non si pu mai dire arrivi quando sembri andato via ti sento dentro tutte le canzoni in un posto dentro che so io
6887045 it was my partners favorite place in the world and i wanted to honor him in some way
6887046 no no i go to the movies but i dont buy movie companies i mean im always interested in understanding the math of things and understanding as much as i can about all aspects of business
6887047 and what i learn today may be useful to me two years from now i mean if i understand the tar sands today and oil prices change or whatever may happen ive got that filed away and i can use it at some later date
6887048 because you could be the worlds greatest mining engineer but if you were wrong about the price of oil in a big way it would negate all that knowledge
6887049 so i can tell you that if you had 120 oil from now till you know 50 years from now that the tar sands would work out very well but i dont know the answer to that
6887050 they just missed me but hit the two trucks behind
6887051 this road used to be safe but in the last month theyve been attacking more and more
6887052 the talebans trying to cut the main roads to kabul to target supplies for foreign forces just like the mujahidin did with the soviets if the highways are cut even for two days it could also create riots in the city
6887053 he also says that the moolahs have been to all the villages and laid the people under ban not to assist the english and that consequently the mussulman population are as one man against us
6887054 the taleban will surround kabul politically and militarily to make it hard for nato forces to receive logistic convoys
6887055 that will mean less nato movement and will show we can make trouble in the capital
6887056 in no sense have they created or can they make a strategic threat to the government of afghanistan
6887057 were fine for fuel and food with the air power we have and the quality of troops on the ground there is no way they can win
6887058 they used to warn us not to supply the infidel
6887059 if they catch me now theyll throw me in my own container cover me in petrol and burn me alive
6887060 it is the first time in europe since the cold war that a foreign army has entered the territory of a sovereign state without any internationally accepted legal basis
6887061 it is the only way for our country to protect our national security and sovereignty when the borders of nato expand so too does the region of peace and stability
6887062 i want to remind all political forces in our country that shout about the possible neutral status of ukraine that neutrality can come at a very high price
6887063 we need to increase the military budget so that there is no question about what happens tomorrow
6887064 the peace and security of europe are under threat thus a united europe should give a robust and appropriate response
6887065 this is my personal tragedy and that of my family
6887066 unfortunately it has become an integral part of the political debate in ukraine
6887067 trascurri con total normalidad y los tiempos que se registraron fueron los mismos que tradicionalmente ocupan las activaciones con la venta del terminal
6887068 il vantaggio dellincomprensibile che non perde mai la sua freschezza
6887069 this is unbelievable i simply cant believe it its a dream come true
6887070 i simply started playing flw fantasy fishing because i love fishing and because it was fun we have a lot of dreams and this will help us make many of them come true
6887071 in 1996 when we launched flw outdoors i dreamed about the biggest payday in pro bass fishing when the champion of the forrest wood cup could claim the first 1 million prize in pro bass fishing
6887072 fifteen years later we achieved my personal goal of awarding 1 million to our forrest wood cup champion not once but as of last sunday two years in a row
6887073 a 1 million prize for pro fishing seemed unbelievable 15 years ago thats why todays 1 million flw fantasy fishing grand prize is so incredible imagine winning a million dollars with the click of a mouse from the comfort of your living room
6887074 with the excitement that flw fantasy fishing has created all over the world in the past year i have no doubt there will be many more like michael thompson who will become flw fantasy fishing millionaires in the years to come
6887075 flw fantasy fishing has been the single best thing that ever happened to professional and recreational bass fishing
6887076 its setting a new benchmark and attracting record numbers of new fans to our sport
6887077 this is absolutely great i love ranger bass boats and it will be great not to have a monthly boat payment anymore
6887078 playing flw fantasy fishing has been a lot of fun and i cant wait until the start of next season
6887079 it was very slippery at the beginning but it was getting cleaner and cleaner through the day
6887080 today its just been step by step trying to improve and trying to improve the balance of the car the whole time im in the car and on the track im learning something about the track were just finding pieces of the puzzle and putting them together not really had a any problems we had one little spin today weve just started off on the right foot weve increased our pace got through our testing program i think were looking good
6887081 here its very important to make sure you get a gap because when you get stuck behind people you struggle to see round the corners because theyre blind
6887082 i need to play well this week and next week and so far this week ive done that
6887083 if nick then feels i am worthy of a pick so be it if not then thats acceptable
6887084 i love playing in the wind its fun but today was calmer and i managed to score well again
6887085 van desde la evasi n de impuestos a la disoluci n de los parlamentos en suazilandia y kuwait

6887089 usarlo reducir a en un 50 las lesiones graves y en un 75 las heridas de efecto mortal
6887090 the fact that we erased all of yesterdays gains so fast suggests that were still in a bear market theres just not much demand out there
6887091 the dollar got pounded yesterday and everybody rushed to buy commodities as a safe haven now the dollar is strengthening so everybodys dumping commodities again
6887092 obviously yesterdays rally was overcooked and were simply taking back some of that speculative risk premium we injected into the market
6887093 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6887094 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6887095 at the end of the day it is all about oil perceived value against a backdrop of uncertainty and a world and economic system gone wild
6887096 the best way to judge in terms of commodities is to watch the dollar that is the gauge that will drive them all
6887097 wir glauben dass das nicht alles ist dass dies erst der anfang ist

6887118 the light volumes are really sort of the reasons behind why youve got some outsize moves i think the issues over all for the economy and the market are fairly well understood
6887119 the market is of this mind set that were going to continue to be flattish to down
6887120 we need to absolutely find a bottom in financials to really believe that the bear can be behind us
6887121 it seems peculiar to me that sun would condescend to allow scotia to have say a 35 percent interest
6887122 scotia is the weakest in the mutual fund business so they are trying a number of ways to augment their wealth management sector
6887123 it would seem more likely to me that sun would buy more of ci or if theyre prohibited from doing that because of some standstill agreement then i think they would talk to ci on a friendly basis

6887125 this closing was driven by our ongoing global asset utilization process which identified the opportunity to shift our production to other north american facilities resulting in lower energy consumption and production costs
6887126 my recent remarks may have been mistakenly construed as a call to rescind the colorado river compact and commence negotiations for new water allocations
6887127 let me be clear that i do not advocate renegotiation of the compact
6887128 i think the word renegotiate does not have double meaning
6887129 it is about opening it up and negotiating it again and the fact that hes willing to do that again has to demonstrate in my mind given the context of it a bias for the lower basin states his desire still to renegotiate it was really pretty direct
6887130 this is a reversal of direction but its a reversal that i think colorado voters have to pay clear attention to because on the west slope im not sure there are more important issues than the issue of the scarcity of water

6887136 beyond synthetic component measurements to examine the energy consumption of the entire computer through proven workload development methodologies eecomark will be the first implementation of the upcoming ecma energy efficiency standard for computers like all bapco benchmarks eecomark will follow bapcos mantra of real world real benchmarks ensuring relevant and meaningful workloads
6887137 despite significant effort by stakeholders involved in bapco and support from epa and the ec to create and agree upon a benchmark bapco membership decided not to submit their eepa tool eecomark to epa at this time as such epa and its counterparts in the ec are immediately moving forward with the provisional idle plan referenced in the final version 4 0 computer specification as made clear in the version 4 0 specification this provisional idle approach will include revised idle state levels that in line with energy star guiding principles recognize top performers in energy efficiency
6887138 there is a very harsh humanitarian crisis in the city
6887139 the fighting has displaced more than 5 500 people from the city
6887140 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6887141 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6887142 i saw that announcement we will continue to monitor the situation but we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now
6887143 there has been some movement of forces but whether or not that is an indication of a withdrawal or just a repositioning of forces is a bit difficult to determine at this point but those movements remain minor
6887144 we will turn our attention to providing the assistance that georgia needs to rebuild its infrastructure provide humanitarian relief aid its damaged military and help shore up its currency

6887163 theres a large labor force very close to us in east timor and in the region and we need to find ways where we can have a win for east timor provide some support there as well as fill a need here

6887165 fruit picking is one of the very few jobs for which they can qualify because in the northern territory particularly youve got 10 000 young men and women who cannot read write or count because of the northern territory aboriginal education
6887166 its something that they could do in the northern territory but they dont have the backbone or the will to do it in other parts of the country
6887167 its true that the education system has not served our remote indigenous australian well but turning people into unskilled labourers is not the answer
6887168 they should probably be introducing a tax for energy waste if you want to knock a building down if you want to waste that energy then you have to make a payment for it
6887169 potentially hundreds of millions of dollars have been wasted delivery schedules have slipped contractor employees have been laid off
6887170 the end result is a current it system used to identify terrorist threats that has been crippled by technical flaws and a new system that if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system in operation today

6887183 i think what really stands logic on its head is the idea that the way to organize union work is to encourage signatories to produce non union under our contracts
6887184 it is not appropriate to wait until new media reigns supreme to assert jurisdiction
6887185 sag coverage of all new media productions would not result in more non union production but rather would result in more union production sag members will do their part by adhering to rule 1 and declining non union work we have to do our part by making sure work opportunities are covered by a union contract
6887186 its ok for me to be saying that because i obviously have an interest in preventive health because my business involves selling supplements
6887187 the bronx knew in order to get past us theyd have to throw him against us
6887188 i told our kids this will be the game of the tournament
6887189 we were so close that if you wanted more children youd better not be throwing
6887190 thats the sweetest swing ive ever seen from a kid that age
6887191 i mean i didnt even know what a slider looked like
6887192 i was pouting crying because i wanted it so bad
6887193 i was like wow i cant believe our last out is in the hands of our youngest player
6887194 i didnt want him to feel that he was alone
6887195 making the last out in a tournament like that can be devastating to a kid and thats what he was just a kid
6887196 i think everyone including the youngsters from california are realizing theyre watching little league greatness out here on the mound no one knows what will happen down the road for this young man but oh my goodness what a future he could have
6887197 we kept telling him honey i dont think youre gonna to get 6 foot tall
6887198 hed show his biceps and say welcome to the gun show but only at home
6887199 he was picking up trash and putting it in the trash can
6887200 he just wanted to make sure they left the dugout the way they found it
6887201 i was man screw the slider stay with the curve
6887202 because they say hes danny almonte but coming here kurt was like hey forget your last name thats the joke around here hes got no last name hes just danny
6887203 im not gonna let anyone in no interviews from now on id like to give you two or three years back and let you be a kid let you just focus on baseball and see what you can do
6887204 youd think when they checked your birth certificate theyd have showed you how to pick up an effin foul ball
6887205 hey buddy can you tell me how many 14 year old kids you know that can make a fake birth certificate
6887206 but it just boils down to somebody forgetting what his last name is
6887207 and after he invited him he looked at matt and said make sure you bring both your gloves
6887208 and i looked at my wife and said both his gloves
6887209 in our business youve got to remember a lot of things
6887210 these are the kind of things that i keep under the rug

6887602 when you are surrounded by a fleet of battleships all taking aim at you the possibility of a submarine is not really a problem
6887603 how can you be sure you dont infringe on someone elses patent
6887604 the fact is that these standards have known patent pools they are listed in the documents on the web sites even in the press releases
6887605 if youre limited to an executive summary flowchart of no more than 10 boxes that fit on one page youd be hard pressed to tell the differences between any of these codecs the differences are all in the details of course the details are very important
6887606 the claim that building on top of h 261 frees you from patent concerns and thats a reason to use h 261 over theora is dubious as theora is based on a codec of approximately the same age the truth is that as soon as you start trying to move forward using any of the discoveries published since then you immediately run into patent concerns again
6887607 part of the problem is that there is no legal test for unencumbered nor do you have to be infringing to get sued we will always have a halting problem here and yet both vorbis and theora are 10 years old with no claims against them would another 10 be sufficient twenty vague threats that come to nothing nothing that is except eliminating the monopoly interests competition are the story of my professional life patent law is being used to extort outright and most of the interests represented here are willingly buying into it this isnt even getting to the trolls and we sit around and wonder why this industry is so dysfunctional

6887610 what is the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe

6887612 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his spirit in the inner man
6887613 now to him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think according to the power that works within us
6887614 i need the strength of jesus to do this day
6887615 take my hands and let them move at the impulse of thy love
6887616 guard your steps as you go to the house of god and
6887617 for your names sake you will lead me and guide me
6887618 god has good plans for other people he is doing grand things in others lives but i am just sitting here living a normal life and he doesnt have good things for me
6887619 the way of trust is a movement into obscurity into the undefined into ambiguity not into some predetermined clearly delineated plan for the future the next step discloses itself only out of a discernment of god acting in the desert of the present moment the reality of naked trust is the life of a pilgrim who leaves what is nailed down obvious and secure and walks into the unknown without any rational explanation to justify the decision or guarantee the future why because god has signaled the movement and offered it his presence and his promise
6887620 this is eternal life that they may know you the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent
6887621 it was disappointing for andy that he lost early at the olympics as he wanted to do well but i dont think its a bad thing for his us open chances i think it could actually work in his favour as it means that he will have had a longer rest period between playing in the olympics and in new york if andy had reached the semi finals or better in beijing he wouldnt have had so long to prepare for the us open and fatigue would have been an issue
6887622 i dont believe that his confidence would have been affected by his olympic defeat it was just one of those strange results that happens every so often and he knows that he was playing some great tennis on the north american hard courts before beijing
6887623 i believe that the us open is the toughest grand slam to win the weather can be a factor and everyone can play on the hard courts so it is a level playing field it is the final grand slam of the season so there is the possibility of fatigue especially as the night matches can go on to one two in the morning so andy having extra rest before new york will have done him no harm at all
6887624 andy has been playing the best tennis of his career since wimbledon
6887625 winning his first masters series title was a step up for him but the next goal for him will be to win a grand slam title
6887626 i want to throw a net over you and take you on a journey
6887627 i worked at a company nike where we were accused of child labour rights issues i managed to have a career there for 15 years and
6887628 the man is embarrassed about the indignity brought on the club and the premier league he said to me if you need me to resign from the football club as a director because it would serve the needs of the premier league then im fine with that as long as that doesnt change any other thing i e his ownership
6887629 its almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
6887630 well be as big as manchester united if i didnt have that goal i wouldnt be here can we win the premier league yes will we it might take a bit longer can we win the champions league growing up at nike you dont sit around saying can we you say we will
6887631 china and india are gagging for football content to watch and were going to tell them that city is their content we need a superstar to get through that door richard dunne doesnt roll off the tongue in beijing ronaldinho brings access to major sponsors and financial reward
6887632 ronaldinho was up for it but he got a call from ac milan one day were going to be a club that players say manchester city just called me i had no choice with the superstar it wont be this transfer window now because theyre too complex
6887633 mark and i talk about this a lot and he sort of understands
6887634 we told mark not to come if he thought we didnt need a superstar mark wants to challenge himself to manage the best footballers in the world but mark is from the old school he would rather overpay for the player he knows than for the player where hes relying on scouting reports thats an endearing piece of what mark is all about we cant have roque santa cruz which means marks now back in an uncomfortable zone where he will have to bring in someone new
6887635 im not treating them like a commodity but in the two transfer windows everybody is for sale
6887636 when you get to the dead of winter and people start pulling the gloves and tights on and you get five games in 10 days its bloody hard for them mark is saying we need some people with some mettle mark will feel he isnt successful if he doesnt finish in the top six
6887637 in the draft theres no exchange for cash here its about greed and jealousy although im not going to use the word corruption you can imagine that where theres greed and jealousy then theres something else as well thats mayhem
6887638 in america all the marketing is managed by a separate entity and all the team has to do is play and put people in seats here clubs like united arsenal chelsea and liverpool are dominant
6887639 this is the most powerful sports league in the world but maybe the most undervalued united havent even scratched the merchandising surface and if anyone has a head start its them
6887640 you and i couldnt set up a pop group and call ourselves the drifters because someone owns that
6887641 the market is worldwide theres something not right about sitting in a bar in bangkok beijing or tokyo and seeing fred smiths plumbing call 0161 i talk to premier league chief executive richard scudamore about this all the time are we maximising the central entity of the premier league he rolls his eyes and says if only we would the club chairmen tend to think globalisation is about selling more shirts its about strategic partners in other countries red bull thai airways
6887642 if you could central entity the top 10 teams to create a global empire called the premier league i would sacrifice my own club birmingham city into another division for that do saudi arabians want to buy stoke city or do they want to buy newcastle villa united city there are 10 clubs id like not to have promotion and relegation theres an emotion around those battles but the dynamics by which fans can get their kicks can change
6887643 sacaban a enterrar a un muerto hijo nico de su madre que era viuda
6887644 al verla el se or tuvo compasi n de ella
6887645 there are no great battles ahead and therefore how shall i put this i have no great battles anymore
6887646 i have really decided not to get involved with issues of the state i do not have a role or place anymore
6887647 i might disappear and you might not hear of me for a while
6887648 having completed this huge project hes going to kind of wait in the wings and see what develops
6887649 who would have thought that libya would be the most pampered country by the americans
6887650 i want to be the best player in the world and that isnt possible at real madrid
6887651 ive come to an end of a cycle ive played three seasons at real madrid ive scored goals ive won two leagues
6887652 i have an offer which is good for me and the club i dream of playing in the english league i hope to resolve this situation as soon as possible its not about money i simply want to leave
6887653 we need one player inside the pitch that makes a difference we have one team that we play one system to change this system we need different players if we have one system only it is easy for other teams hes a fantastic player all the coaches in the world would like him in their squad
6887654 we have 26 players now if i lost one or two more players it is not a problem for me
6887655 he was out of training on thursday i think he was in milan after the ukraine game
6887656 i received the information that he is outside because he had a negotiation but friday was normal training and i didnt ask him about milan
6887657 i dont ask him what happened because its not my business training is my business he is one more player that i have one more option for me shevchenko is part of my plans maybe i need to give him more confidence with me and time sheva needs time and i need time
6887658 he always tries to do the best job for the national team and chelsea sometimes people do not understand what is happening with the players with the team because it is not one player who makes a team it is 11
6887659 what is very important is to start the season well by qualifying for the champions league and winning our first few games
6887660 i think theres more to come from my team we have a structure and a way of playing thats very efficient and that we have mastered well so i dont see why we should not set high targets
6887661 they chelsea were impressive but portsmouth were really not at their best wenger added chelsea look a candidate but theres nothing new with that
6887662 without question the hardest thing i have ever done in my entire life physically and mentally
6887663 the olympic record is really special to me tim mack is a hero of mine i was really hoping to replicate what he did and i cant believe that its come true
6887664 we have been told clearly by the government to budget on that 100 million figure and weve made our plans accordingly
6887665 we get one shot at a home games we must build on the success of beijing
6887666 i believe we should look at an increase in the number of medals that will be a step forward no one wants to go into a home games and stand still
6887667 we want to see evidence of development and success and wouldnt make exceptions all sports will be treated on a no compromise basis
6887668 athletics would themselves agree that they havent delivered in the way that our most successful sports have and they know they have a long way to go
6887669 in sports that are trying to increase their performance potential the most effective way is to concentrate on a smaller group of athletes
6887670 whats the difference between the information school and the original information school whats an msi degree whats happening to library schools what ever happened to the l word
6887671 all is well with him and were looking forward to it
6887672 the lad who rides him every morning said he new approach is seriously well
6887673 there are four runs attributed to ryder that are in the wrong place in both the batting section of the score and in the bowling section
6887674 there is no doubt that a recording error of some kind has occurred so where do these runs belong
6887675 it is all about the scoring an activity usually taken for granted

6887691 we now have reason to believe that the logic error in the gems code can cause this event when no such antivirus program is installed on the server
6887692 we are indeed distressed that our previous analysis of this issue was in error
6887693 it is the dedication of board officials such as those at the butler county board of elections who went above and beyond the call of duty that gives me confidence that preparation with our local partners will lead to a successful november election
6887694 now that what appears to be the root cause for this voting tabulation error has been identified we will prepare ohios counties using the premier voting system software with instructions for following strict protocols needed to identify and correct this error if it occurs
6887695 we will continue to monitor the situation and provide boards of elections with the instruction and support they need to ensure an orderly and efficient election and an accurate count of ohioans votes

6887728 while the company reported a profit in each of the first two quarters of 2008 and our affiliate banks remain above regulatory requirements for being well capitalized institutions our board of directors believes that the current economic conditions require prudent management and conservation of capital at our affiliate level this decision was made with a focus on maintaining the long term shareholder value that can be realized by continuing to have well capitalized and profitable affiliates our directors and executive officers who own approximately 20 of aanbs outstanding shares realize that suspending the dividend is a serious action but we firmly believe that this action is necessary and will be beneficial to the shareholders in the long term the company expects to resume the payment of dividends as economic conditions improve

6887736 angie you have gone cunt crazy for lucy lawless and someone needs to push a come back to reality stick up your poop poop hole before its too late
6887737 with the skyrocketing costs of fossil fuels combined with the 6 percent increase in food costs people are definitely beginning to feel the crunch
6887738 if you have no debt at all youre making no monthly payment
6887739 its very easy to kind of go along without budgeting your money month to month i would assume the budgeting process itself and the discipline that flows from that is probably good in terms of getting some kind of regular savings contribution going as well
6887740 as people have higher incomes they tend to report better financial situations what we find is no matter what people make they find ways to spend it
6887741 people are more likely to say that they are saving because they have a higher income but thats definitely not the case
6887742 my initial reaction to the results of this question was that people are fooling themselves about their level of saving if the national average puts saving in the negative yet your respondents indicate they are saving somethings amiss and i suspect its their perception
6887743 many people are well intentioned knowing the value of saving but just cant seem to consistently save any real amount of money others actually do make deposits into a savings account only to pull it out when the slightest need arises
6887744 nearly half 47 percent of consumers are saving either nothing or less than 10 percent of their income that seems to be a sign of the times
6887745 even very small amounts wisely invested over time can accumulate into fortunes but time is not on your side if you start saving later in life therefore saving 10 percent might be the perfect amount for the young person but far too low for the middle aged american staring at retirement
6887746 in my 22 years in this business ive never spoken with anyone who said theyd saved too much
6887747 itd be interesting to follow up in a year and see if the respondents are all driving old cars took no vacations and are living in homes in need of improvements
6887748 in other words if you know youre saving for a new car its easier to save even if you deny yourself an occasional vacation cars are going to need replacing and home repairs are going to have to be made therefore the wise consumer will acknowledge this and begin earmarking money toward those needs
6887749 there is clearly a gender issue and that shouldnt be a surprise in terms of family trajectories divorce rates income differences
6887750 but clearly women are reflecting greater financial anxiety not only are they more likely to have debt but theyre more concerned about it
6887751 however i suspect that the 41 percent who say they are satisfied relates mostly to a feeling that they are saving as much as they possibly can not that they would not want to save more
6887752 just for comic relief i have to point this out 50 percent of those who dont save say they save as much as possible because theyre worried about tomorrow
6887753 generally any transfer is required to sit out one year as a full time student regardless of sport but the student athlete and the new institution have the option to seek a waiver if they believe their particular situation merits an exception to the residency requirement and or contains extenuating circumstances that warrants relief from the one year requirement

6887784 it is simply unacceptable for members of the community to subject our fire crews to abuse at the scene of an incident where they are trying to help
6887785 to enter a fire and rescue service vehicle and carelessly manoeuvre it into other vehicles shows a total lack of respect for the hard work of the emergency services
6887786 this womans actions are unbelievable and totally unacceptable and we will not tolerate this kind of behaviour

6887790 i dont care who it is its for charity ive been beaten up by the press so i dont care if i get a few shots by a kid half my age
6887791 this is unbelievable i simply cant believe it its a dream come true
6887792 i simply started playing flw fantasy fishing because i love fishing and because it was fun we have a lot of dreams and this will help us make many of them come true
6887793 in 1996 when we launched flw outdoors i dreamed about the biggest payday in pro bass fishing when the champion of the forrest wood cup could claim the first 1 million prize in pro bass fishing
6887794 fifteen years later we achieved my personal goal of awarding 1 million to our forrest wood cup champion not once but as of last sunday two years in a row
6887795 a 1 million prize for pro fishing seemed unbelievable 15 years ago thats why todays 1 million flw fantasy fishing grand prize is so incredible imagine winning a million dollars with the click of a mouse from the comfort of your living room
6887796 with the excitement that flw fantasy fishing has created all over the world in the past year i have no doubt there will be many more like michael thompson who will become flw fantasy fishing millionaires in the years to come
6887797 flw fantasy fishing has been the single best thing that ever happened to professional and recreational bass fishing
6887798 its setting a new benchmark and attracting record numbers of new fans to our sport
6887799 this is absolutely great i love ranger bass boats and it will be great not to have a monthly boat payment anymore
6887800 playing flw fantasy fishing has been a lot of fun and i cant wait until the start of next season

6887802 i just wanted the tribe to say yes we recognize that you are just as important as any other tribe member and we will treat you and your spouse as we treat all tribal members

6887804 for our tribe we want people to walk in the shoes of other people and learn to respect differences

6887816 there are four runs attributed to ryder that are in the wrong place in both the batting section of the score and in the bowling section
6887817 there is no doubt that a recording error of some kind has occurred so where do these runs belong
6887818 it is all about the scoring an activity usually taken for granted
6887819 its not specific to a god its your god believing in a higher power it would be great to show a little patriotism in our community im in support of putting this up anywhere we can
6887820 god is the most important thing in the world but were just talking about a generic god
6887821 this is a small way to recognize teachers but hopefully it has a big impact we want them to know they are appreciated and ultimately that appreciation has an impact on the children they influence everyday
6887822 this is really a great idea a partnership of mutual benefit
6887823 the runnin rebels give a gift of recognition to our teachers and in return we get to help grow the fan base and show our support for a great team hats off to lon and his team for their community spirit
6887824 we wanted to make this as simple as possible for the donors
6887825 its also crucial to us that the tickets are used appropriately we have been working with the school district on this concept to make sure we give them something that will benefit their efforts this program is designed to help all those involved
6887826 in sports we have an engine to do a lot of good things to support the community
6887827 by being creative and working with partners we can do some things that support a lot of people in many different ways if our fans support teachers in this effort they will also be supporting unlv basketball
6887828 set some foundations ahead of what is going to be an important november for us
6887829 we have a new blend of experience in the coaching staff and we felt that this camp would be key to getting the ideas of both the staff and players across ahead of the new season
6887830 once we get into september it really is a short space of time before we will arrive at our first camp ahead of the november games so it will be important to our preparation

6887840 opening with the perfect foreshadowing device a summary of the legend of st valentine author jamieson wolf sets the reader up for an erotic supernatural romp thats going to have meaning the story valentine is fast paced and well told and offers not just a quick and lusty romance but a storyline that makes the reader sympathize with the characters plights and care about the point wolf wishes to make
6887841 i like this writers way with words valentine is an amazing book that everyone shoul read he builds a good plot and develops his characters well i would give it 5 stars out of 5
6887842 jamieson wolf writes with some of the strongest emotion i have found in ages his passion is reminiscent of that seen in the works of shakespeare and others of that time period his characters love deeply and without restraint overcoming every obstacle placed before them this is truly a tale for all those who believe love has no boundaries
6887843 jamieson wolf is what i would call a fabulous storyteller he dreams up or gets visited by great characters and he paints them vividly when he writes he gets fantastic story ideas and pounds them out in a way that makes you lean in toward the computer screen or flip through the physical pages faster and faster to see whats happening to these people next
6887844 this book is great this is a must read book for any body who loves ghost fantasy supernatural fun a surprise around every corner awaits the reader i am so happy to have purchased this book and add it to my own family library we just have to wait until jamieson wolf gets another fun book out there for all of us to read well worth it for your own fun reading and for your book collection a five star rating from me love it
6887845 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6887846 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6887847 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6887848 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6887849 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6887850 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6887851 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6887852 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6887853 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6887854 fraco volume no caminho de alta e fraco volume no caminho de baixa
6887855 preciso que o dinheiro volte para que a recupera o da bolsa seja firme
6887856 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6887857 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6887858 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6887859 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6887860 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6887861 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6887862 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6887863 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6887864 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6887865 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6887866 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6887867 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6887868 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6887869 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6887870 im not jerking your chain it is a huge honor to me that out of the entire world the one record label you hand your material to is preying man tits that is more flattering for me then you could imagine i like your music alot

6887877 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6887878 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6887879 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6887880 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6887881 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6887882 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6887883 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6887884 who are open to doing something on the production side
6887885 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6887886 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6887887 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6887888 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6887889 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6887890 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6887891 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6887892 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6887893 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6887894 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6887895 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6887896 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6887897 the world still is the same blows tie away from mouth you never change it
6887898 be glad of life because it gives you the chance to love and to work and to play and to look up at the stars
6887899 e una situazione insostenibile si legge in una nota delle quattro associazioni che si colloca in un anno in cui le famiglie italiane subiranno un carico economico di oltre 2 000 euro rispetto al 2007 e che necessita quindi di interventi sia di carattere congiunturale che strutturale in diversi settori della nostra economia oltre che interventi mirati sui vari carichi fiscali soprattutto di prodotti e servizi energetici

6887907 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6887908 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6887909 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6887910 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6887911 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6887912 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6887913 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6887914 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6887915 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6887916 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6887917 we have the ability to educate ourselves and get involved in the political process but instead we have decided that there are more important things to do than make life better ourselves
6887918 there are four runs attributed to ryder that are in the wrong place in both the batting section of the score and in the bowling section
6887919 there is no doubt that a recording error of some kind has occurred so where do these runs belong
6887920 it is all about the scoring an activity usually taken for granted
6887921 su questa questione andr fino in fondo e non escludo luscita dalla maggioranza alla fine della prossima settimana
6887922 prime location and relatively low tuition make admissions at college of charleston quite competitive expect more personalized treatment here than you would receive from clemson or the university of south carolina
6887923 very high faculty to student ratio makes it easy to get help when you need it
6887924 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6887925 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6887926 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6887927 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6887928 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6887929 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6887930 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6887931 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6887932 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6887933 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6887934 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6887935 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6887936 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6887937 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6887938 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6887939 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6887940 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6887941 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6887942 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6887943 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6887944 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6887945 its not mccains wealth per se because we dont resent the rich we want to be them
6887946 the issue becomes out of touch we want presidents who get what the average american is dealing with
6887947 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
6887948 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
6887949 we are in control of the streets of the city of gori
6887950 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6887951 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6887952 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6887953 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6887954 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6887955 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
6887956 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
6887957 we are in control of the streets of the city of gori

6887962 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6887963 van desde la evasi n de impuestos a la disoluci n de los parlamentos en suazilandia y kuwait
6887964 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6887965 help i have students with adhd in my classroom what can i do
6887966 clouds and clouds of white smoke just kept bellowing out
6887967 clouds and clouds of white smoke just kept bellowing out
6887968 we genuinely feel every town needs representation from both parties because it provides checks and balances
6887969 we are definitely trying to rebuild the party from the ground up and this is hopefully a big step in that direction
6887970 i dont particularly agree with them but they have a right to their opinion thats what makes america a great place we can disagree on things though that doesnt make them right
6887971 the council meetings are the purest part of the democratic process
6887972 if we televise that i dont know what purpose that serves other than entertainment to me if you want to be part of the process youve got to be there
6887973 in a democracy discussion is extremely important and presenting to a constituency options is part of the american experience
6887974 however with this group of individuals who have only attended 13 percent of the meetings this year i find their accusations outlandish and misleading i have full confidence in the residents of dumont recognizing the positive changes that the borough has experienced in the last three years

6887986 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6887987 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6887988 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6887989 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

6888166 therefore falls upon the journalistic profession to evolve institutional checks and safeguards specific to the electronic media that can define the path that would conform to the highest standards of rectitude and journalistic ethics and guide the media in the discharge of its solemn constitutional duty
6888167 censure emanating from a jury of peers would indisputably affect the credibility of a channel

6888420 kui algselt oli kokku lepitud et rock summeri kaubam rgi omanikuks on neli meest siis 1989 aasta kevadtalvel m tles j ri mber et see on ikka tema oma et k igil teistel s ilib t r m olla t v tja tema ettev ttes minule ei sobinud see mitte ks raas ja nii need t lid algasid
6888421 mingil moel l bi j ri tuttavate tekkis kontakt soome radio 1 ga ja sealse v ga toimeka mehe markku veijalaisega
6888422 samas k ik see mis eestis toimus oli neis tekitanud erilise huvi s na glasnost oli maailmas k ige enam kasutatud s na
6888423 et nende poolt oleks ka tehnika nii see asi ketrama hakkas
6888424 meil ei olnud isegi vahendeid et l ne vendadega mingeid l bir kimisigi pidada meil polnud isegi faksiaparaate ega telekseid v ga suure osa sellest t st tegid ikkagi ra radio 1 tegevdirektor markku veijalainen ja tema seltskond
6888425 see et tol ajal b ndid ldse julgesid eestisse tulla v rdub sellega kui t na helistada m nele l ne artistile et meil siin l una osseetias on ks lava les pandud ja et me siin laulame ka natuke kki tulete esinema
6888426 ritasime k ll sponsoreid leida aga see oli tol hetkel utoopia
6888427 nii me saimegi sellise k va nime nagu juice leskinen ja palju teisigi
6888428 eks paljud tulidki sellep rast et see k ik oli neile p nev ja tundmatu ja soome kaasasolek andis ka kindlustunnet
6888429 mitmed nimed kes soomlaste poolt ette l kati ei elnud meile ju midagi nagu n iteks rootsi ansambel sky high
6888430 aga saime ka selliseid esimese suurusj rgu t hti nagu big country steve hackett nagu public image ltd koos john lydoniga need olid ikka nimed kelle kohta ei osanud muud elda kui k si laiutada sest meie senine tase oli piirdunud czes aw niemeni locomotiv gt ja v ib olla veel m ne soome ansambliga selline h pe oli midagi uskumatut nii meile endile kui ka muusikamaailmale
6888431 soomlased v tsid festivali kui k ige tavalisemat bisnisprojekti ma ei teagi kas nad j id kasumisse v i kahjumisse igatahes m letan et big country n udis oma esinemise eest 10 000 naela mis oli nende tavaline taks
6888432 tegemist oli vastutuleku ja rar kimisega eks promootorid vaatasid seda kui v imlust ja avanevat turgu aeg oli poliitiliselt soodus rituste korraldamiseks lisaks oli esimesel summeritel v ga palju kaasas vabatahtlikke raha ei loetud isegi osa tehnikat anti tasuta
6888433 ega me nendele artistide n udmisetele ja lepingutele kus kirjas millised peavad olema hotellid ja mis peab olema laual lava taga mingit t helepanu ei p ranud
6888434 see oli meie jaoks nagu abrakadabra kui big country sellid laeva pealt maha astusid ja avastasid et nad ol mpia hotellis on pandud kahekesi hte tuppa elama oli nende imestus pehmelt eldes ko maarne
6888435 mitte midagi polnud k ike tuli hankida alates peldikupaberist ja l petades ei tea millega see oli ikka omajagu kurnav
6888436 jah meil polnud pakkuda sviite aga sellega lepiti pigem nauditi hustikku ja eesti t drukuid kes olid imeilusad ning hiljem v is v lismeediast lugeda et niiv rd rahumeelset ja muusikakeskset festivali polnud nad varem kogenudki
6888437 nad olid ikka t iesti h mmingus sest esiteks ei olnud nad kuulnud midagi eestist ja ega nad ka teadnud mis neid ees ootab ilmselt olid nad valmistunud palju hullemaks mis neid ennek ike h mmastas oli publik et rahvas on nii muusikajanune eriti hakkas see silma steve hacketti esinemise ajal ta oli ju laval akustilise kitarriga aga samas v is kuulda n ela mahakukkumist see k ik oli v lisartistide jaoks t iesti k sitlematu nagu seegi et platsil viibivad miilitsamehed pigem kuulasid n pp suus muusikat kui et rahustasid m nda laamendavat festivalik lalist
6888438 sestap olimegi hiigelsolvunud kui melody maker kirjutas et kultuuri pole siin mitte mingisugust ja k ik see mis siin toimub on t ielik jama
6888439 k llap see korjati les et asi liiga ilus ei tunduks
6888440 aga need olid v ga v ikesed miinusargumendid mis v lja toodi aga k ik muu toimis ikka v ga h sti
6888441 k igepealt said filharmoonia piletid otsa siis linnahalli piletid ja l puks toodi juurde mingeid pileteid linnavalitsusest
6888442 see oli meeletult v imas pilt kui big country oli laval ja kogu see rahvamass kaasa elas
6888443 see tohutu siiras vastuv tt ja s nergia mis publiku ja ansambli vahel tekkis
6888444 ega ikka ei l k ll me oleme muusikud ja mitte poliitikud
6888445 kogu v ljak nuttis ja keegi v lismaalastest ei saanud aru mis meil toimub
6888446 ja v lismaa artistid niipalju kui neid seda n gi ei uskunud oma silmi et kogu see rahvas eri hinnangutel oli platsil 60 000 80 000 inimest hoiab k est kinni ja laulab kaasa
6888447 me k ik olime natuke k rvust t stetud ja positiivselt meelestatud sest k ik sujus le ootuste h sti miks siis mitte korrata
6888448 suutsime n idata et ei tuldud maale kus elatakse kiviajas emotsionaalne laeng andis ka t uke ja usu teist summerit korraldada
6888449 j ri oli oma ajast ees kohe p ris mitu sammu samas kui majanduslik olukord ei j udnud j rele ja rahvas ei j udnud j rele see k ik maksis k tte
6888450 pangad m di v lismaalastele toetussummad v henesid uus reklaamiseadus keelas philip morrisel oma toodangut reklaamida nii et mitu asja korraga
6888451 makarov on tohutu ideede generaator ja need ideed on tegelikult v ga nutikad kui aga teostamiseks l heb on meri p lvini ja ta ei arvesta mingit realiteeti ning tulemused on hukatuslikud ta ju sisuliselt k rutas kogu selle kaubam rgi pankrotti

6888477 because of the unique nature of the democratic primary we believe obama will receive a significant bump from his convention
6888478 this cycle mirrors bill clintons democratic convention in 1992 a historic 16 point bump barack obama is more similarly situated to bill clinton in 1992 than any other candidate in recent history we believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment
6888479 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought
6888480 the key idea behind the knol project is to highlight authors
6888481 somehow the web evolved without a strong standard to keep authors names highlighted
6888482 the goal is for knols to cover all topics from scientific concepts to medical information from geographical and historical to entertainment from product information to how to fix it instructions
6888483 refers to both the project and an instance of article in the project
6888484 knol has been described as a rival to both wikipedia and about com
6888485 in contrast to wikipedia where articles are written collectively each article in knol will be written by a single author and cannot be edited by others

6888551 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
6888552 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellant relatively little is known about how it actually works
6888553 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellants are compared
6888554 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies
6888555 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
6888556 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
6888557 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
6888558 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome
6888559 we were tired of having our families running around the country looking for answers from people who didnt have them
6888560 the more we talked the more we realized our boys had things in common that were not addressed in the literature
6888561 kyle knows that people dont understand xxyy and therefore dont understand him as a person she said
6888562 the study helps the world know why he is like he is it validates what he knows about himself and what we know about him when he cant follow directions its not because hes stupid
6888563 a new look at xxyy syndrome medical and psychological features
6888564 i have always had a dread of becoming a passenger in life
6888565 he is not being treated any differently to any other person in these circumstances

6888610 with the democratic and republican national conventions just around the corner and with pennsylvania a swing state in novembers general election the current condition of the commonwealths economy deserves the attention of both presidential candidates

6888819 las ni as empiezan a hablar y tenerse en pi antes que los chicos porque los hierbajos siempre crecen m s deprisa que los buenos cultivos
6888820 una mujer no es m s que un animal y no un animal del orden m s elevado
6888821 las mujeres han sido hechas para ser amadas no para ser comprendidas
6888822 la nica manera en que un hombre debe comportarse con una mujer es haciendo el amor con ella si es bonita o con otra si es fea
6888823 la mujer est donde le corresponde millones de a os de evoluci n no se han equivocado pues la naturaleza tiene la capacidad de corregir sus propios defectos

6888830 acredito que todos procuraram fazer o melhor as empresas investiram centenas de milh es de reais nesse processo talvez n o tenhamos tido a possibilidade de avaliar com anteced ncia a complexidade dos testes que amos fazer e eventualmente n o fomos bem sucedidos em todos os testes que desenvolvemos
6888831 you can burn me you can shoot me but you cant kill me
6888832 tenemos una agenda extremadamente compleja y diversa en salud jornadas como estas est n destinadas a discutir nuestra salud a saber de que nos debemos muchas cosas parar la pelota un rato discutir escuchar ser escuchados opinar aceptar que hay ideas distintas aceptar que las verdades no siempre son absolutas aceptar que hay una evoluci n constante aceptar que el cambio forma parte de esta actividad y a partir del debate sacar algunos puntos que nos sirvan a nosotros que tenemos la responsabilidad de conducir a la provincia para tomar decisiones
6888833 a la vicegobernadora de la provincia que ha tenido esta idea y ha trabajado mucho para que esta idea sea una realidad
6888834 es muy importante saber y entender que la ayuda debe llegar a quienes m s necesitan nuestra provincia todo el nordeste o el noroeste argentino claramente es la zona de nuestro pa s que m s necesita de este acompa amiento este acompa amiento orientado a la educaci n a que tengan los chicos los tiles a que existan pol ticas concretas para quienes tienen capacidades diferentes a las etnias originarias de nuestra provincia a la buena convivencia familiar son valores indispensables que hacen a nuestra formaci n como sociedad como provincia de manera que expreso el agradecimiento y la predisposici n de este gobierno a trabajar siempre juntos y por sobre todo que los necesitamos que muchos misioneros y misioneras muchos argentinas y argentinos necesitan del apoyo de ustedes
6888835 me gusta la frase la salud que nos debemos los misioneros me gusta porque arranca desde una visi n sincera de las cosas arranca de una sensaci n de que todav a tenemos muchos por hacer y creo que sos son los enfoques que se deben dar desde los gobiernos a cada una de las problem ticas asumir que siempre quedan cosas pendientes m s en t rminos de salud
6888836 tambi n en salud claramente estas zonas del pa s presentan muchas veces ndices datos valores que muestran que todav a nos debemos mucho nos debemos demasiado a n cuando si uno compara con otras realidades la realidad de misiones y de argentina en t rminos de salud p blica todav a es bastante mejor que otros pa ses pero si comparamos con otras realidades desde el momento en que tenemos alrededor de la mitad de los misioneros sin una cobertura social que dependen exclusivamente de la salud que presta el estado cuando vemos la cantidad de trabajo informal cuando vemos la cantidad de gente que no tiene obra social la cantidad de gente que avanzada su vida no tiene una jubilaci n ni un esquema de cobertura provisional y social sin duda alguna que notamos que las cosas que debemos hacer y mejorar son infinitas
6888837 a m me parece que es muy bueno y esto lo reflexionaba hace un tiempo con los docentes que dediquemos y que paremos la pelota un instante del d a a d a ese d a a d a que hace resolver problemas sin dudas pero muchas veces lo urgente le va ganando el tiempo a lo importante la prioridad hace que en el d a a d a no podamos mirar el mediano y el largo plazo tomar esas decisiones estrat gicas que nos permitan cambiar verdaderamente los rumbos o provocar las sensibles mejoras que nos requieren nuestros sistemas
6888838 me parece que jornadas como estas est n destinadas precisamente a esto bajo la premisa de discutir nuestra salud de saber de que nos debemos muchas cosas parar la pelota un rato discutir escuchar ser escuchados opinar aceptar que hay ideas distintas aceptar que las verdades no siempre son absolutas aceptar que hay una evoluci n constante de todo de nuestra sociedad de la tecnolog a de los medicamentos de las enfermedades aceptar que el cambio forma parte de esta actividad y a partir del debate sacar algunos puntos probablemente no muchos pero algunos puntos que tengan coincidencia y que nos sirvan a nosotros que tenemos la responsabilidad de conducir a la provincia para tomar decisiones
6888839 siempre decimos que no nos gusta hablar de salud p blica y de salud privada siempre decimos que hay una sola salud que es la salud del pueblo misionero la salud de esta regi n hay actores p blicos y actores privados se diferencian obviamente lo que viene de la mano del estado es de todos lo que viene de la mano del privado es de sus due os unos buscan rentabilidad los otros no pero todos deben tener clara la eficiencia como norte y por sobre todas las cosas de que estamos tratando con personas con personas que tienen necesidades y que toda vez que uno recurre al m dico al doctor a lo que fuera vinculado a la salud en la mayor a de los casos est frente a un problema con un estado de nimo complejo frente a algo que preocupa a la familia si hay algo que preocupa a la familia es la salud de alguien de nuestro entorno o de nuestro grupo familiar partiendo de eso tenemos que ver que no todo se puede tomar desde una visi n sencilla como si hablar de salud fuera lo mismo que hablar de educaci n de seguridad o de justicia estamos hablando de la vida del estado de nimo del dolor de muchas personas
6888840 en estos d as si algo me ha impresionado y no tengo m s elementos que los que tienen ustedes al escuchar los medios nacionales ha sido este triple crimen en el que supuestamente puede haber algo vinculado a la adulteraci n de medicamentos hay que ser mala gente para adulterar un medicamento cobrar 20 000 pesos a una persona que se est muriendo de c ncer que tiene una esperanza y le pon s cualquier l quido adentro de su cuerpo jugando con si vida y con su esperanza eso no ocurre en las pel culas de batman no es el guas n son argentinos y argentinas que tienen esa visi n de que se puede ganar dinero con el dolor con la esperanza con la enfermedad con la complicaci n que tienen este tipo de enfermedades eso ocurre y debemos tambi n plantearnos dentro de estas jornadas de debate qu hacemos nosotros para controlar tambi n estas cosas que no est n rozando lo tico que son verdadera delincuencia pero de la m s baja son todos temas que debemos incorporarlos
6888841 en nuestras pol ticas de salud podemos discutir c mo las llevamos adelante c mo acercamos la oferta a los distintos lugares c mo podemos trabajar de manera arm nica lo p blico con lo privado para poder desarrollar y acercar la oferta a cada uno de los rincones de la provincia c mo trabajamos con estas enfermedades tan especiales propias de nuestra zona est en discusi n la problem tica de la leishmaniasis y tuvimos un verano complejo con el tema de la fiebre amarilla y debemos saber que no hizo fr o y podemos tener otra vez un verano complejo con estos temas y tenemos que salir a trabajar sabiendo que las fronteras son imposibles de controlar que en el puente hay colas de auto pero a los mosquitos no se les pide documento y tampoco se les hacen an lisis
6888842 tenemos una agenda extremadamente compleja y diversa a veces hablo con algunos intendentes y les pregunto qu te hace falta en tu hospital y me dicen gente
6888843 porque el que estaba ac se fue a otro lugar de la provincia o se fue a otro lugar del pa s o nos falta una especialidad hay que discutir la problem tica de los recursos humanos discutirla desde la seriedad desde la cantidad de horas que se tienen que trabajar desde la visi n de lo que es un m dico full time y un part time que tampoco pueda ser que tenga su cargo de m dico full time e inmediatamente est pensando en c mo abrir su cl nica privada o como por ah me dicen tenemos que controlar los medicamentos porque los medicamentos de salud p blica terminan estando en cl nicas privadas tenemos infinidad de cosas para discutir en un tema complejo donde no se est discutiendo si sacamos un par de kilos de yerba m s o si un chico repite de grado o si construimos o no una cuadra de asfalto estamos discutiendo la salud y la vida de los misioneros
6888844 desde el gobierno provincial tenemos lineamientos lineamientos que buscan la descentralizaci n hemos puesto en marcha importantes inversiones en infraestructura en diversos lugares de la provincia hemos puesto como prioridad poner en marcha inversiones culminar el madariaga que probablemente merezca una discusi n c mo vamos a hacer para administrar un hospital de ltima generaci n muy distinto a lo que tenemos ahora nosotros aportamos desde el seguro provincial de salud aportamos desde una pol tica de medicamentos pero tambi n sabemos que quiz s algunas de las cosas que estamos haciendo por ah no son las necesarias y si algo quiero y trabajamos y nos obsesionamos en el gobierno es en asignar bien los recursos en ser eficientes y transparentes a la hora de la asignaci n de los recursos de manera que todas las pol ticas que lleva adelante el estado provincial las hacemos con la mayor buena voluntad lo que no significa que sean acertadas todas nuestras pol ticas tambi n deben ser sometidas al debate a la consideraci n todo lo que hacemos puede ser profundizado puede ser mejorado o incluso puede ser descartado
6888845 its a little silly for apple to set it up this way
6888846 the reality is if youre on the internet youre open to spamming anyway and this is just one more way for spammers to get your e mail address
6888847 may he also give you the blessing of abraham to you and to your descendants with you that you may possess the land of your sojournings which elohim gave to abraham
6888848 se a gente olhar nas entrelinhas vamos ver que n o estou fazendo nada fora da lei mas acham que serei beneficiado por ser filho do presidente isso porque ele tem uma grande aprova o popular mas se ele n o estivesse t o bem certamente nem colocariam esse obst culo
6888849 como pai eu te ap io mas o presidente da rep blica n o pode entrar nessa discuss o minha pol tica minha e a tua a tua
6888850 back in the 1700s there was a comedic actor named joe miller died in 1739 he wrote tons of jokes and after he died a writer by the name of john mottley compiled his jokes and wrote a book called joe millers jests the book became wildly popular and john mottley continued to add more jokes to it until it had over 1 300 mottley never claimed to be the writer and always credited the book to miller mottley continued to add other comedians jokes to the book under millers name and as time went by the book and jokes were so overused by people that into the 19th century people started using the term a joe miller when a joke was stale or overused so thats the story of john mottley and why we liked the name for our club
6888851 our goal is to mix different mediums of comedy so that anyone who attends our show will enjoy it
6888852 but so far we havent seen anything except for promises
6888853 o aparecimento de uma contradi o n o necessariamente um sinal de erro de racioc nio um sinal de que alguma coisa na realidade n o redut vel l gica cl ssica
6888854 apesar dos ferimentos graves ele estava at mesmo consciente quando o encontramos ele n o podia falar mas sentou em um banco e se explicou com gestos

6888887 the party the ppp has unanimously nominated party co chairman mr zardari to be the next president
6888888 the most interesting creative political solutions we christians have to offer our troubled society are not new laws advice to congress or increased funding for social programs although we may find ourselves supporting such efforts the most creative social strategy we have to offer is the church
6888889 christianity is more than a matter of a new understanding christianity is an invitation to be part of an alien people who make a difference because they see something that cannot otherwise be seen without christ
6888890 we are not called to help people we are called to follow jesus in whose service we learn who we are and how we are to help and be helped
6888891 the christian colony is gods means of a major offensive against the world for the world
6888892 si no hay tinto de verano la casera no hay verano
6888893 india today is a recognised force and i hope to see that india is no longer referred to as a third world country or a developing nation it should be referred to as a developed nation and a first world country
6888894 i think that those who chose to go out of india and settle abroad one must acknowledge their desires to do so but what i had noticed was that despite the fact that indians had gone out of india and settled abroad and becomes nationals and lived in the environment and acquired citizenship they have never ever forgotten their roots thats why we come and relate to them
6888895 primarily we are very proud of our country we are proud of our history we are proud of our culture it goes back thousands and thousands of years we are proud that we fought for our independence we are proud that we are the largest democracy in the world and we are very proud now of the way india is progressing after the economic liberalisation
6888896 it could be that the united states of america and developed world are largely responsible for the emissions but in time to come with india developing and the kind of development that is taking place we will also be victims of this the same kind of emissions
6888897 if the erosion of beaches continue with such a pace it wouldnt be surprising if the nesting turtles abandon the orissa coast altogether
6888898 the impact of progressive loss of beaches is being felt some 30km north of the paradip port already
6888899 once the ports start being operational the erosion would be unstoppable unless the government erects a sea wall across the entire 476km stretch along the orissa coastline
6888900 the last thing i want is a feeling that tatas are unwanted for whatever reasons in bengal
6888901 i have unknown to most of you lived in jamshedpur for six years i know west bengal well i have spent a lot of time in west bengal i have always had a very soft corner for west bengal
6888902 some support uranium mining some are neutral and some oppose the project
6888903 ultimately it is upto the government and the people to take a final decision as uranium mining is needed for the countrys energy requirement
6888904 we made it clear that radiation because of uranium mining would be minimal and there would be no health hazards the land used for mining would be as clean as it was before excavation
6888905 the experts of atomic energy commission explained all aspects of uranium mining to us but we are waiting for their comprehensive report as the issue of health hazards needs to addressed
6888906 unless they can protect the people from radiation we will not be ready to carry out uranium mining we cannot see people dying
6888907 we have conveyed our message of cancelling the project to the prime minister through the union cabinet secretary
6888908 we came to bengal when many people considered us to be mad but if any segment of the state feels that we are exploiting them we will exit
6888909 i dont want anyone to go back from bengal but no one can blackmail us into calling off our singur dharna our peaceful august 24 agitation stands as scheduled
6888910 if anybody is under the impression that because we have made this large investment of about rs 1 500 crore we will not move then they are wrong it is not a hypocritical investment we would move whatever the cost to protect our people employees
6888911 i have to applaud all the people who have been working at the site they are working under tremendous tension our compound walls have been broken people have been coming in and materials are being stolen
6888912 we cant open and operate a plant with police protection if that is the way it is to be before we start you can well imagine our concern about what will happen if we try to operate
6888913 but if the state for any reason or any segment of the state feels that we are exploiting them first of all it is totally untrue but if that is the feeling we will exit
6888914 i dont know how many rs 1 500 crore investments would come to bengal
6888915 we came to bengal at a time when many people considered us mad to be investing in the state there had been very little development in bengal there had been very little investment and tata motors decided they would locate one of their prime and most unique factories in bengal everybody had great apprehension about us making this investment in bengal
6888916 this is the beginning his bronze medal will give birth to many vijenders from bhiwani he is a true hero and his close defeat 8 5 is proof
6888917 did you know that even after winning so many medals he vijender still travelled in buses become like vijender when you grow up
6888918 vijender has shown this village and bhiwani that everything can be achieved with devotion he wanted to win gold but he has shown us the path
6888919 these moments are rare and i want to tell people what i was doing when our own son was making history i am going home for an hour to watch the bout i have no choice but to close my shop
6888920 ella era la nica mujer embarazada en la familia y siempre mantuvo una estrecha relaci n con ricky
6888921 as you all know a seat is vacant in my ministry i will be filling it up soon and effecting a minor reshuffle within the next 10 to 15 days
6888922 the general opinion was the movement should continue for about a fortnight but cannot be extended till the pujas if the government can be given a jolt it may offer some concessions that would help our party leader claim a moral victory a trinamul general secretary said
6888923 our public stand is that 400 acres must be given back but we are willing to negotiate and settle for a smaller amount
6888924 its better if the government announces a decision to return some land after holding further talks with us then we can also help the government identify the plots that would give us an escape route to call off or tone down the agitation
6888925 she had been on a 26 day fast on the singur issue and called it off after the president and the prime minister requested her our fresh singur movement too can be called off if the government agrees to give her something she can show off as a victory roy said
6888926 i firmly believe the government will not allow our dharna to continue beyond this month and will come out with a solution
6888927 political mileage in the same way that nandigram had helped her win votes
6888928 why is the government not making the deal with the tatas public
6888929 several other industrialists are making a beeline to invest in bengal why were the tatas who have invested only rs 1 500 crore given undue advantage
6888930 but what about the security of the people of singur why was tapasi malik murdered
6888931 tata was not here for so long did the people of bengal starve to death why is there trouble wherever tata goes
6888932 why did the tatas have to come back from bangladesh and kalinganagar we were not there to lodge protests
6888933 i have no problem if tata concedes our demand for return of 400 acres
6888934 you are only seeing tata cry but why cant you see the silent tears of poor farmers whose 400 acres were forcibly acquired to set up ancillary units cant these units be shifted elsewhere

6888955 we are indeed distressed that our previous analysis of this issue was in error
6888956 it is the dedication of board officials such as those at the butler county board of elections who went above and beyond the call of duty that gives me confidence that preparation with our local partners will lead to a successful november election
6888957 now that what appears to be the root cause for this voting tabulation error has been identified we will prepare ohios counties using the premier voting system software with instructions for following strict protocols needed to identify and correct this error if it occurs
6888958 we will continue to monitor the situation and provide boards of elections with the instruction and support they need to ensure an orderly and efficient election and an accurate count of ohioans votes

6889446 i used to think he was ok but now he seems kind of crazy
6889447 it seems like he used to always complain about negative campaigning and now it seems like hes been doing more of it lately its like there are two mccains
6889448 well thats absolutely true but i blame not mccain but both the media and obama for that mccain early on offered to do town meeting after town meeting with obama obama turned him down so now mccain has to campaign and frankly the media wants to cover the horse race from the medias point of view the ideal presidential campaign looks more like the world wrestling federation then anything else so if mccain wants to get any media attention he has to say negative things about obama its how the system works he hates it he tried to change the rules but he failed in part because the other candidate wouldnt go along meanwhile he does mostly town meetings with his campaigns sometimes at those meetings people stump him because they can talk about anything like i saw him get stumped when someone asked him while medicaid pays viagra but not birth control pills but now hes the one that brings that up
6889449 i can totally see how hes forced into that by the media

6889506 the cruelty found was beyond our expectations and it was hard to document without interfering it caused nightmares to the team especially in the editing room because the scenes had to be replayed and replayed to be edited from six hours down to 20 minutes
6889507 our main goal was to get this distributed because we want consumers worldwide to be aware about the cruelty involved in the fur fashion
6889508 people have a right to know that a huge percentage of fur is imported from china which doesnt have any federal laws protecting animals on fur farms people who might contribute to this atrocity by purchasing fur or fur trimmed garments need to know about the horrible suffering of the animals who wore that skin first
6889509 we want them to see how fur farmers slam terrified animals including raccoon pups on the ground and skin them while theyre still conscious people need to know what theyre really buying when they buy fur or fur trim
6889510 conditions on chinese fur farms make a mockery of the most elementary animal welfare standards
6889511 this report shows that chinas colossal fur industry routinely subjects animals to housing husbandry transport and slaughter practices that are unacceptable from a veterinary animal welfare and moral point of view

6889618 the enthusiasm and the energy amongst our fans and our players is very evident i think thats good i think its exciting from a football standpoint and a coachs standpoint when your players are excited about the upcoming season and its legitimate enthusiasm
6889619 when i played here at pitt up until my senior year i was enthused about playing and excited about wanting to go out there and win every week and do all of those things but when tony dorsett made a couple runs that made the enthusiasm legitimate
6889620 now you kind of feel like boy this could really be exciting and i think our team feels that way right now we havent played a game but i think our offense feels like our defense has a chance and our defense feels like weve got some players on offense that can do some things so i think the enthusiasm is legitimate

6889643 breast pain can be cyclic coming with menstrual periods or it can be more persistent
6889644 one of the best gifts they can give themselves and their babies is to breastfeed for as long as possible
6889645 then when your breasts shrink again you have this loose skin that makes it look saggier than it did before
6889646 theyre fibrous tissue that holds the breast up a bit and those can stretch over time and that leads to some of the sagging too
6889647 wearing a tight fitting bra on a regular basis probably doesnt make a big difference
6889648 but wearing a bra that prevents a lot of bouncing like with jogging probably does minimize stretching of those fibrous bands
6889649 many of these things that cause breast pain in young women are going to turn out to be benign but there are breast cancers that happen in young women
6889650 my advice is just because youre young and youre less likely to have a cancer doesnt mean that you shouldnt get it looked at
6889651 its easy enough and there are certainly women out there who find their breast cancers that way
6889652 i encourage all women to do a breast self exam and get comfortable with what their breasts feel like
6889653 thats when you have the least hormonal effect and youre going to have the most accurate exam
6889654 as we get older sort of in a progressive way but certainly after menopause the breast becomes more fat and has less glandular tissue
6889655 we lose the hormonal effect on our glandular tissue in our breasts and over time that tissue atrophies
6889656 thats a time when women notice their breasts are less firm certainly less tender if theyve had problems with tenderness and theyre less lumpy
6889657 as the fat content increases the sensitivity of the mammogram often increases

6889667 it is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin barefoot irreverence to their studies they are not here to worship what is known but to question it
6889668 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs

6889672 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6889673 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6889674 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6889675 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6889676 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6889684 our ability to monitor these keys over a long period of time allows us to tell the client for example if a key changed 30 minutes ago and that maybe you should call the sysadmin that something is up
6889685 in firefox 2 we put up a message that was incomprehensible to users about trust chains and so forth we also gave users a whatever button which essentially allows the user to ignore the security warning
6889686 but the warning is valid and users should adhere it we decided to default block self signed and untrusted certificates users can add exceptions and make them permanent if they want to
6889687 it allows us to push the warnings to be much stronger instead of presenting the user with an innocuous should i trust this
6889688 its easy for someone to convince you to go through their computer when making connections through public wi fi

6889702 on july 21 the 21st navajo nation council began its 2008 summer session with a parade of horse riders who rode from the four corners of the navajo nation to the historic council chambers in window rock in the beginning of the second day of the session a majority of the council delegates from across the entire navajo nation signed a letter endorsing howard shanker for congress the dine hataathlii association a prestigious organization of more than 300 medicine men and women endorsed shanker this spring the first time they have ever endorsed a political candidate shanker has also been endorsed in part by the yavapai apache nation and by the chairman of the hopi tribe
6889703 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting has not yet subsided
6889704 hemos integrado muchas situaciones diferentes para que jugu is en el modo cooperativo
6889705 the only thing harder than planning for an emergency is explaining why you didnt
6889706 why have you brought me down now at his time
6889707 look you useless dunce of an iyer i am stricken with fever as a punishment from allah for employing a non believing idol worshipping putter you attend the meeting with the american captain this evening this file contains all details if we do not get this agency i swear by allah that i will personally cut you up into small bits and feed you to the sharks
6889708 rishi as a last resort you may have alcoholic drinks if that is going to help matters you may even eat meat dont worry we will purify you afterwards by doing homams
6889709 if i may say so sir you have a fine ship good evening to you captain hornblower you have a fine visage and a noble mind
6889710 i have to hurry up the captain is due in the office at 11
6889711 youre the one always beside me when im lost youre always to guide me
6889712 but now youre heading better seasons and your mom shes watching you from above with fingers crossed for everything you do
6889713 hopefully well show the wirelessly powered laptop in the not too distant future
6889714 you could imagine having one of these on your desk and you might drop your phone on your desk and have it charged
6889715 nobody cares about your products and services except you and the others in your organization
6889716 what your buyers do care about are themselves and they care a great deal about solving their problems and are always on the lookout for a company that can help them do so
6889717 in the patients who are obese the rate of motion of heart muscle changed
6889718 as a childs bmia body mass index for age increases we see alterations in both the relaxation and contraction phase of the heartbeat many of these changes that have been seen in adults were assumed to be from long standing obesity but it may be that these changes start much earlier in life than we thought
6889719 based on this study these subtle markers can help us predict who could be at risk for heart disease and heart attacks
6889720 the plumes appear during geomagnetic storms and they can interfere with satellite transmissions airline navigation and radio communications
6889721 okay now weve seen the smoke but where is the smokestack
6889722 many believe the source of the plumes is near earths magnetic equator
6889723 africa is a great place to check this possibility because the magnetic equator passes directly over the sub sahara
6889724 there arent enough sensors in africa to study the phenomenon
6889725 north america has an abundance of dual frequency gps receivers thousands of them in a network we use to monitor north american plumes but africa has only a few dozen
6889726 within a few years we hope to deploy hundreds of receivers
6889727 consider the list of organizations who have joined forces to sponsor the africa space weather workshop nasa noaa the national science foundation the european office of aerospace research and development eoard the international center for theoretical physics ictp and many others
6889728 its widely understood that africa is key to the puzzle
6889729 we hope to be making realtime maps of the ionosphere over africa too
6889730 it made the transition from tropical depression to hurricane within 24 hours right before landfall it was a record breaker
6889731 forecasting intensity is one of the biggest problems we have right now with hurricanes
6889732 hirad will see from above through a hurricanes heaviest rains and thickest clouds to measure the intense winds at the surface of the ocean
6889733 strong winds sweep and swirl across ocean waves whipping up foamy white froth
6889734 hirad measures microwave radiation naturally emitted by this froth the stronger the winds the more froth and the more microwave radiation
6889735 note how winds are not shown for the thickness parts of the clouds we hope to be able to fill in that gap with hirad
6889736 for the best picture of whats happening inside a hurricane you need to know both wind speed and direction well look at the thickness of the foam on one side of the wave as opposed to the other this will give us the wind direction
6889737 when you fly an instrument on a satellite it helps everybody on the globe
6889738 it improves forecasting around the world for countries that dont have the ground based radar and aircraft instruments larger countries have
6889739 in the post katrina era it is especially satisfying to be working on something so immediately beneficial and possibly life saving
6889740 scientists just didnt discuss this idea before people assumed that the repair just happened right there where the damage occurred
6889741 i think it is the most damaged dna that gets relocated
6889742 it may be better to let some cells die off that have been damaged
6889743 often we saw repairs happening near the boundary between the dense area containing all the chromosomes and the surrounding emptier regions
6889744 its more likely to be an accurate repair that way
6889745 hand the baby back to dad you are going to drop my little brother
6889746 an increasing number of conservative republicans have begun to argue that the party would benefit from four years on the outside in order to rethink a conservative agenda and sharpen its message
6889747 mccain and liebermen theyre are men if obama cant stop them the republicans can
6889748 whats in it for me and no one else matters but me
6889749 that little piece of filth who stole the white house
6889750 meanwhile john mccain appears to be wrestling with which course of action makes sense for him it s not a matter of choosing between emotion and political calculation but rather two different personal allegiances
6889751 the downside of selecting mr lieberman is that it would not only anger conservative republicans but could lead to a revolt at the party convention next month
6889752 mr mccain is also a very visceral politician someone who works best with those with whom he has close personal ties
6889753 republicans have begun to argue that the party would benefit from four years on the outside in order to rethink a conservative agenda and sharpen its message
6889754 i think they are going to it way too many times you cant help but have admiration and respect for the guy
6889755 its become a crutch in the campaign i think he is in danger of trivializing it
6889756 no youre a burly man and people will stare and i im trying to enjoy my eggs benedict dont give me that pouty face
6889757 we see problems with patients who dont have the right experiences
6889758 we want to have a standard in place that patients and insurers can see
6889759 and jci has been in business many years to improve quality and safety
6889760 the advisory board came back and told us no no you cant accredit
6889761 poor economic conditions have created a very different and difficult dynamic
6889762 om man delar ansvaret finns m jlighet att klara b de jobb och barn
6889763 man m ste dela ansvaret f r ett hem om det ska vara ett r ttvist samh lle
6889764 there was a direct threat to the governor in the letter we do have persons of interest we are pursuing that now
6889765 there had been some speculation that this may be related to similar letters that had gone to sen mccain as far as we can tell they are not
6889766 i saw it fine i just figured at that point the time of the game a diving catch would have been a great play ruggiano said
6889767 but it would have been a lot worse if i would have let the ball shoot by and that winning run was on third base and scores
6889768 given recent market movement moodys believes these firms currently have limited access to common and preferred equity capital at economically attractive terms
6889769 i knew this was her favorite show she is fanatical about the music and the cast and my plan b was nowhere near as exciting
6889770 how can we not be happy weve gotten what we want
6889771 were overjoyed to see our own police on our streets again
6889772 we are in control of the streets of the city of gori
6889773 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6889774 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6889775 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6889776 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6889777 they are erasing this village from the face of earth so that ossetians would come here
6889778 the opening track hes simple hes dumb hes the pilot absolutely blew my mind when i first heard it
6889779 as they say in advertising 50 percent of all expenditures are wasted but you cant tell which 50 percent well its the same with government affairs
6889780 we looked at the process from the primaries to the fall and saw the conventions as a key point for our users wanting to be involved we wanted to provide tools to give anyone around the world access to whats happening in both cities
6889781 it used to be hey i have to be home by prime time to watch coverage on the major networks
6889782 but the public is in the drivers seat this time not the big campaigns
6889783 the reality is this is a convention that will be covered more on the web than it will on tv
6889784 bloggers will be a huge component certainly more than in 2004
6889785 we had great success this year so were not going to be ungrateful and complain
6889786 im not going to look at the race as a disappointment we gave it our best shot it didnt work out
6889787 we were disappointed about the women it was wonderful for us but disappointing for the women
6889788 i was a little bit off balance but when i went to put it in she was running away from me it was too late
6889789 i just wanted her freeman to stop but it just happened it was just unlucky
6889790 im gutted i dont think i went early but i dont know what happened im just sorry
6889791 weve practiced and worked so hard it was a medal for us but hopefully well bounce back
6889792 thank you for stating your firm opinion on virtualizing sql server
6889793 it kind of started out as a dull pain almost like a numbness in my back but it just kept getting worse
6889794 it started in my lower back and then it kept going down my leg
6889795 i just couldnt i couldnt bend over to get my shoes on
6889796 the center of gravity within the human body changes itself and it puts more pressure of gravity on the smaller back joints in the lumbar spine increasing the normal curvature of the spine to a point where it puts more pressure back there
6889797 i feel like a whole new person i feel alive again
6889798 this couple with web hebrew seniorlife seeking telecommunication analyst in boston ma novant health seeking chief technology officer in charlotte nc go beyond google and get vertical
6889799 i was on vacation last week down at a lake and let it grow when i got back i thought hey its playoff time maybe ill just keep it
6889800 its a hockey thing in hockey guys grow the beards so thought i would give it a shot and see if it works
6889801 my entire career depends on me getting off this list
6889802 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
6889803 depois do resultado nos jogos pan americano do rio de janeiro prata sou uma nova atleta aguerrida e obstinada como sempre mas agora mais cautelosa

6889807 i applaud mayor greg ballard for keeping another important campaign promise by bringing long overdue ethics laws to our city the new laws will help continue efforts to make government more transparent and one the public can have confidence in combined with the openness of the budget process todays signing reinforces mayor ballards commitment to make city government open and accountable to the people of indianapolis and marion county
6889808 because of the unique nature of the democratic primary we believe obama will receive a significant bump from his convention
6889809 this cycle mirrors bill clintons democratic convention in 1992 a historic 16 point bump barack obama is more similarly situated to bill clinton in 1992 than any other candidate in recent history we believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment
6889810 death really slapped me in the face came out of no where
6889811 this should be a death penalty case he should never get out for what he did to this child five months old he hits the baby so hard his fist probably compressed into the spinal column
6889812 in order to be forgiven for my mistakes i have to forgive and it helps us move on if we keep reliving it in the past we never move forward and we dont get the closure that we need jordan will always be a part of me always be with me in spirit everyday just because hes physically not here he is with us
6889813 ive been blessed i have two great children and i think this experience has taught me and hopefully others a valuable lesson that you cant take anything for granted we need to protect our kids we need to know where they are at all times we need to check the back seat we need to call the baby sitter we need to know where they are im not saying its right its never going to be ok
6889814 we sometimes hire 200 plus h2 b employees and with extensions well be about half that
6889815 other ski resorts particularly ones in colorado rely heavily on h2 b ski instructors but we never did as much
6889816 weve just focused a little more attention on domestic hiring
6889817 weve tried to attend more universities in the springtime weve looked at areas where unemployment might be a little higher and drag from those regions
6889818 ay danos a devolver una sonrisa al rostro de estas supervivientes
6889819 ellas dicen que vienen a un sal n de belleza con la expectativa de que van a estar relajadas
6889820 explican que si ven personas que han pasado por tanto dolor y miseria esto las deprime ellas tienen algo de raz n pero tambi n hay clientes que se enorgullecen de pedirles a estas muchachas que les pasen el secador de pelo o que les hagan la manicura o pedicura
6889821 nunca hab a tenido la paz mental que ahora tengo tuve mucha m s angustia mental en mi vida de casada que ahora
6889822 i love the road but when i stopped wanting to pack my bag and get on the bus that was a telltale sign it was time for a change
6889823 so with a heavy heart a deep respect for where she came from and an artists hunger to evolve heidi newfield flew the trick pony coop
6889824 right away we just clicked right away i think he got my song sensibility and was right on track with it loved that i wanted to step out from what i had been doing kind of get out of the bar room for a minute
6889825 thats the way i feel like a record should be made
6889826 its been creative and fun and professional and just a total joy
6889827 from the moment that we started in on it we all three just sort of looked at each other and went ok wait a minute this is really a special song
6889828 i still listen to johnny amp june right now after all the writing and going through it and living with it and i still get chills up my spine
6889829 powerful and big and crazy and wild everybody wants to find that kind of a big love in their life
6889830 it takes a special man to watch their spouse get on a bus and go up amp down the road
6889831 this job takes a lot out of you and it is very time consuming and even when youre home youre not sometimes my wheels are always turning and he goes off in that way too but then you have your time together we do a good job supporting one another
6889832 interesting and sad the ultimate joy and the ultimate pain and sorrow at the same time but my mom its weird because i really feel her shes with me very much shes right there with me
6889833 we didnt know what we were doing and we certainly didnt have the money to be running me all over back and forth between nashville but they did their very best to try to support me
6889834 there are parts of this record that are not just about a man and a woman for me
6889835 theyre about my experiences all the way around like leaving the group and my feelings about that the pain and the hurt or the joy of being independent and standing on my own two feet everybody who listens to this record can take these songs and place them in their lives and relate to them
6889836 i wanted to create a body of work no matter how long it took me
6889837 i had no interest in just going in and making another nashville country record that gets thrown out there
6889838 our goal with docushare express is to provide a partner with a quick way to deliver a solution to the customer
6889839 featuring news links and progressive media criticism from around the web along with commentary from eric boehlert and jamison foser
6889840 so the obama campaign is going all out on the issue of mccains multiple houses isnt that kind of stupid yes it is and it was also necessary
6889841 dave mudcat saunders could be the greatest political operative since machiavelli no democrat should be working with a guy who sleeps with the confederate flag on his bed
6889842 the group of militants opened fire at the surrounding troops resulting in an on the spot death of an army colonel and two soldiers
6889843 in the subsequent gunbattle five militants were killed a search operation is now on in the machil area of the north kashmir kupwara district
6889844 the only demand we make is of freedom india must grant it to us

6889860 is ok you could drop the all times are gmt 8 the time now is 04 19 pm
6889861 there is little time left to get a solid negotiating text on the table clearly the clock is ticking
6889862 ho 43 anni ho prestato servizio per circa 11 anni al termine dei quali ho deciso di congedarmi in maniera spontanea ma indotto da fatti personali causati da miei superiori relativamente alla non conformita del mio adeguarmi a direttive che ritenevo eccessive
6889863 non voglio andare oltre questa testimonianza perch di cose da dire ne ho ancora molte ma a distanza di un anno dal mio congedo temo ancora di essere vittima di ritorsioni sembra assurdo ma vi garantisco che cosi ho un moglie e 2 figli cercate di capirmi
6889864 si rende conto che nonostante la voce camuffata su richiesta esplicita dellex poliziotto potrebbero esserci enti istituzionali ad ascoltare la sua voce
6889865 si ed ho paura ma dopo quello che successo a quel povero ragazzo sullautostrada gabriele ndr non posso nascondermi in eterno forse altri seguiranno il mio esempio
6889866 io prestavo servizio a torino facevo spesso le scorte ai tifosi in occasione della finale di champions che la juventus vinse allolimpico fui posto in servizio al treno durante il briefing del personale pre partenza il comandante del reparto ci ordino una volta saliti di stipare i tifosi in vagoni contigui e non farli uscire di li una volta partiti massacrarli di botte prestando attenzione a chi avesse telecamere o fotocamere requisirle e farle sparire
6889867 durante il viaggio di ritorno alla stazione ostiense mi pare i tifosi stanchi
6889868 glie lho gia detto sono un padre di famiglia due figli ora faccio il panettiere
6889869 gymnastics has meant so much to me im going to be busy but id love to keep going

6889872 maybe in january if things calm down ill take a few classes
6889873 visa put the chinese characters on the atms that say destiny

6889876 there is one sign yall come back alicia sacramone was the first to say i wont be back im done everyone else was kind of iffy

6889886 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe
6889887 unlike the current heparin that is harvested from possibly disease carrying animals in often very poor conditions our fully synthetic heparin will be created in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment from fermentation to packaging this will give drug manufacturers extreme control over the safety and purity of the product
6889888 ultimately drug companies are going to need to produce tons of this drug to keep up with global demand

6889907 pronostic la llegada del imam oculto que aparecer a dentro de los pr ximos dos a os
6889908 yo por la presente anuncio que con la ayuda de dios el d a no est lejos cuando jes s regresar junto al imam oculto

6889911 dios ha fijado al imam oculto de ser nuestro partidario
6889912 tenemos una misi n de convertir a ir n en el pa s del imam oculto
6889913 hoy d a la humanidad est procediendo hacia la verdad
6889914 el imam oculto no tiene ninguna presencia tangible entre nosotros pero siempre est aqu y debemos preparar el terreno para su r pida aparici n
6889915 la mayor obligaci n de aqu llos que esperan por la aparici n del mahdi es combatir la herej a y la arrogancia global e
6889916 aqu llos que no responden a la llamada para proceder hacia la verdad no les espera un buen destino yo escuche que el presidente de uno de esos pa ses e d el presidente americano george bush dijo que el presidente de ir n lo estaba amenazando yo le digo yo no soy el que lo est amenazando es el mundo entero que lo amenaza porque el mundo en su integridad es firme contra la opresi n y los opresores ustedes los pa ses occidentales so son nada comparados al poder o de dios nosotros les invitamos a que tomen el camino de la rectitud el camino de los profetas del monote smo y de la justicia si ustedes creen que pueden sentarse en sus palacios de vidrio y determinar el destino del mundo est n equivocados nuestra llamada a ustedes en tomar la direcci n de la verdad brota de la piedad no queremos que se metan en problemas ya que ustedes saben que el resultado de la opresi n y la injusticia es perdici n y destrucci n
6889917 algunos de aqu llos cercanos a ahmadinejad que frecuentemente hablan de la necesidad de preparar el terreno para el retorno del mahdi expl citamente unen el destino del expediente nuclear iran a esta necesidad
6889918 implementar las leyes del islam estableciendo justicia y combatir la herej a y la opresi n son los deberes m s importantes para aqu llos que esperan el retorno del imam oculto y preparar el terreno para su llegada debemos reforzar la fe religiosa y el poder de la religi n en ir n y en el mundo entero para acelerar la venida del imam oculto debemos diseminar la justicia y la ley religiosa para aumentar el conocimiento p blico de ellas a lo largo del mundo para que la fe chiita sea aceptada por la sociedad en todas partes mahdista es su universalidad ya que el mahdi viene a establecer justicia y rectitud en el mundo entero otro aspecto es la diseminaci n de la justicia y la rectitud bajo el mandato de un solo hombre un solo centro y un solo sistema ya que es el imam oculto el responsable de diseminar la rectitud y la justicia el mundo necesitar tener un solo centro y un solo gobierno para que este surja de un estado de divisi n y establezca un solo mandato universal encabezado por el el imam oculto y todo tipo de opresi n y explotaci n desaparecer entonces de la faz de la tierra
6889919 nuestro deber m s noble es esforzarnos por reducir la opresi n ser m s severos en nuestra implementaci n de la ley isl mica y debilitar el control de los reg menes opresivos y tir nicos sobre los oprimidos estas acciones pueden acelerar el retorno del imam oculto si deseamos apresurar la llegada del mahdi debemos remover cualquier obst culo que retarde su retorno cuales son los obst culos que est n retardando la aparici n del mahdi estos son la negaci n her tica de la bendici n conferida en la sociedad por la presencia del imam as como tambi n la ingratitud la insubordinaci n y las objeciones a la doctrina del mahdismo si queremos acelerar la llegada del mahdi debemos eliminar estos obst culos debemos esforzarnos por instaurar una mayor justicia asegurar una m s severa aplicaci n de la ley isl mica llevar a la gente a mostrar un mayor inter s por la fe y sus directivas establecer las leyes religiosas como los valores dominantes de la sociedad asegurar que la fe religiosa sea tomada como un consenso general en las conferencias y limitar el control de los opresores e d de los poderes occidentales sobre los oprimidos a lo largo del mundo musulmanes y no musulmanes esto es lo que nosotros debemos hacer para preparar el terreno a la llegada del mahdi as la obligaci n m s grande de aqu llos que esperan la aparici n del mahdi es combatir la herej a y la arrogancia global
6889920 con el advenimiento del nuevo gobierno y debido a la devoci n singular de ahmadinejad por el imam oculto y su heredero los pueblos de occidente y los disidentes iran es temen un surgimiento en el mahdismo no s lo en ir n sino a lo largo del mundo ellos temen esto porque ven a ahmadinejad aprovech ndose de cada oportunidad y usando cada plataforma para esparcir esta doctrina para que el nombre bendito del mahdi alcance los o dos de todos los pueblos del mundo incluyendo el p lpito pol tico m s exaltado del mundo el assembly hall de las naciones unidas
6889921 durante el periodo de ahmadinejad en el cargo las leyes religiosas que fueron suspendidas y los valores religiosos que se tornaron d biles durante la era de los presidentes khatami y rafsanjani
6889922 en anteriores administraciones tales como la de khatami quien es cl rigo fue la presidencia que le propin los peores golpes a los valores isl micos
6889923 fue una de las se ales anunciando el inminente retorno del imam oculto
6889924 gobierno de ahmadinejad fue establecido para facilitar la llegada del imam oculto
6889925 expone la sociedad al peligro de la debilidad espiritual y lleva a la falta de fe en los principios fundamentales de la religi n
6889926 el peligro de las supersticiones la tarea de los funcionarios electos
6889927 desgraciadamente la verdadera respuesta es que no estamos s lo calmando la sed del pueblo con pura espiritualidad y puro conocimiento religioso sino al contrario estamos llenando sus cabezas con la mayor cantidad posible de creencias idiotas superficialidades y falsedades
6889928 cuando elevamos la santidad de la mezquita de jamkaran al punto d nde esta se presenta como m s importante que las mezquitas tales como la santa mezquita en la meca la mezquita del profeta en medina
6889929 cu nto tiempo continuar creyendo la gente en esta propaganda antes de que su fe sea eventualmente sacudida y vaciada de contenido
6889930 mitos como el halo de luz hacen de la lucha contra las falsas creencias aun m s dif cil
6889931 es triste que las falsas y entupidas creencias hayan recibido recientemente refuerzos apoyados por la fuerza mitos como el halo de luz qu ahmadinejad sinti rode ndolo durante su discurso de las naciones unidas y afirmaciones de conocimiento esot rico y clarividencia que vienen de gente que se supone como una de sus tareas el combatir estas mismas cosas est n haciendo de la batalla contra las falsas creencias m s aun dif cil
6889932 la mayor a de los antiguos ayatolas no est n contentos con el empeoramiento de la situaci n respecto a las osificadas y err neas creencias sobre la mezquita de jamkaran e
6889933 el hecho que creemos en la futura aparici n del imam oculto no quiere decir que algunos de los funcionarios gubernamentales deber an aprovecharse de su nombre para hacer pol tica
6889934 el hecho de que nosotros creemos en la futura aparici n del imam oculto no quiere decir que algunos de los funcionarios gubernamentales deber an aprovecharse de su nombre para hacer pol tica yo me opongo a este tipo de explotaci n la explotaci n de los nombres santos causa que la gente y la generaci n m s joven se disgusten con la religi n ya que no existe ninguna falla en la esencia del islam y cada falla que existe debido a la explotaci n de la religi n herir a nuestro islam en los primeros d as de la revoluci n isl mica la gente grit consignas como independencia libertad y rep blica isl mica el t rmino isl mico significa basado en los principios del islam islam en el que las autoridades calificadas son autoridades religiosas gente importante y sabia y no un islam en el que alguien que tiene poco entendimiento inmediatamente desea expresar una opini n sobre los asuntos isl micos
6889935 no ha llegado el momento para los ayatolas y los cl rigos de clarificar su postura sobre estas afirmaciones
6889936 kadivar dijo podemos se alar al ltimo a o como el auge de la estupidez religiosa
6889937 en la era de la ocultaci n del mahdi nadie puede exigir tener una misi n prof tica o de representarlo
6889938 estamos hoy d a en la era de la ocultaci n del imam oculto y ya que el profeta muhammad fue el sello de los profetas y el mahdi es el ltimo de los imams y l est oculto nadie puede exigir tener una misi n prof tica o representar al imam oculto ni pueden basarse a si mismos en tal misi n prof tica para gobernar sobre el pueblo
6889939 cuando alguien en el gobierno dice que el imam oculto se revelar en los pr ximos dos a os esto no tiene ning n otro resultado que el debilitar la fe de las masas

6889947 an unsolicited vulgar and offensive illustration of a man physically restraining a woman while forcing her to engage in sexual intercourse with him
6889948 this member of the government was at first considered as the most harmless and helpless of all its organs but it has proved that the power of declaring what the law is ad libitum by sapping and mining slyly and without alarm the foundations of the constitution can do what open force would not dare to attempt
6889949 the constitution meant that its coordinate branches should be checks on each other but the opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide what laws are constitutional and what not not only for themselves in their own sphere of action but for the legislature and executive also in their spheres would make the judiciary a despotic branch
6889950 to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions is a very dangerous doctrine indeed and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy our judges are as honest as other men and not more so they have with others the same passions for party for power and the privilege of their corps their maxim is boni judicis est ampliare jurisdictionem good justice is broad jurisdiction and their power the more dangerous as they are in office for life and not responsible as the other functionaries are to the elective control the constitution has erected no such single tribunal knowing that to whatever hands confided with the corruptions of time and party its members would become despots it has more wisely made all the departments co equal and co sovereign within themselves
