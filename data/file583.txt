5830012 helen is a wonderful person shes done an awful lot for me
5830013 i dont know what i would have done without her on several occasions shes been there whenever i called her or when i told her that something wasnt just right she was there
5830014 sometimes when im not feeling as good as i should we just sit around and laugh we always have a marvelous time
5830015 oh lord you get so close to your clients you can see what youre doing you can tell by their expressions how grateful they are
5830016 theyll come down here for hours and just sit and talk now
5830017 thats what its all about just getting them down here talking

5830019 just the difference in how residents are mentally is amazing theyre peppier they want to come down and participate before they were hesitant to come out of their apartments but now were at capacity in the common room every time helen plans an event
5830020 theres a lot of hysteria that the turmoil in the credit market will mean students cant get loans

5830023 i have begun a task to rebuild afghanistan into a peaceful prosperous country into a democratic country a country where the afghan people will have a voice and their rights respected a country that will be producing on its own and living off its own means
5830024 i have achieved some of those objectives i have not achieved some of the other objectives
5830025 afghanistan is not at peace the afghan people still suffer massively in the war against terrorism and in the war for stability in afghanistan afghanistan is not yet a well off country still a very poor country
5830026 does not have a properly functional government yet it must get that
5830027 the reason we are still around is because of the immense resilience of the afghan people and their goodheartedness toward the presence of the international community
5830028 other than that activities like breaking into homes would have gotten us into serious trouble a long time back

5830034 robert dewar is ignoring an important change in the software engineering community
5830035 do you need to know something about engines to be a professional driver nowadays i dont think so taxi drivers dont know that much about their engines there is of course an exception if we look at the high tech side of the car industry in car racing then you need to know something about the car engine in order to get the most out of it
5830036 if we translate this to the story of robert dewar then he is either still in the old days of computing or he is only surrounded by very high tech and demanding companies i suspect that he is a little of both
5830037 consequently cs majors sail through a curriculum of math lite earning a smiley face on their papers for developing projects using pre built libraries
5830038 it shows that he doesnt understand that nowadays its important to select the right components and assemble them into a working application its a skill to do this right it is far from easy given the vast amount of libraries you dont need to know about pointers or learn to program ada to become excellent in this skill
5830039 we are now in an age of reusing components only very complex software projects with lots of real time and reliability requirements can afford to stay close to the metal so should we educate people to be able to develop software for those few complex systems or should we teach them how to make the right choices of what languages and libraries to use for the job
5830040 i agree that the list is indeed meaningless in the context of the anti java professor he wants to educate people in the good old way of engineering nothing wrong with that we only monitor new trends such as the need for dynamic typing the introduction of generics and the integration of functional programming elements in object oriented languages we try to understand why the programming language market is moving in such directions that is something completely different
5830041 if all we do is train students to be able to do simple web programming in java they wont get jobs since those are the jobs that can be easily outsourced
5830042 he is right in this but outsourced to whom india china the scope of the tiobe index is the entire world not only the u s software market so this doesnt count as an argument against the tiobe index

5830054 in a day and age where traveling is getting harder and harder to do because of gas prices irrelevantly high priced hotel rooms just isnt part of the plan anymore
5830055 feedback from millions of visitors collected over the past year demonstrates a clear negative correlation between gas prices and customer satisfaction on automotive and travel web sites
5830056 as the price at the pump has spiked consumers are venting their frustrations online and it isnt just that satisfaction is hurting measurable business outcomes are falling as well in an environment like this its critical that marketers tune into changing consumer sentiment in order to pinpoint opportunities to make small changes that can positively impact customer satisfaction conversion and sales

5830085 is that country music is purely a white rural and southern art
5830086 isnt about dixie though theres plenty of dixie in it its about country
5830087 country music made between about 1950 and 1970 is a secret history of rural working class americans in the twentieth century a secret history in plain sight country music knows that the dark heart of the american century beat in oil field roadhouses in texas and in dim lit detroit bars where country boys in exile gathered after another shift at ford or gm bobby bare mightve pleaded in detroit city that he wanted to go home but we all knew he wouldnt that he couldnt country profoundly understands what its like to be trapped in a culture of alienation by poverty by a lousy job by lust by booze if you truly want to understand the whole united states of america in the twentieth century you need to understand country music and the working people who lived their lives by it

5830105 we asked a lot of questions but they always had answers that wiped any doubt we had away
5830106 however they never did give a downside and that should have been a red flag to us because theres a downside any time you invest in anything
5830107 they just seemed to have our best interest at heart
5830108 they made it look very lucrative to us we thought wow this is just what we need in our time of life we thought it was going to be great
5830109 what they taught us was to operate and think like a bank where you use other peoples money to make money
5830110 we thought it was going to be a two year plan
5830111 they told us it would be a good thing for you and a lot of people are doing it
5830112 they seemed like they had a pretty good reputation as well as some experience so we went ahead and got a loan
5830113 were not the most sophisticated people in the world we realize that so we take responsibility for signing on the bottom line

5830123 as routine surveys in west european countries since the beginning of the 1950s have brought to light
5830124 a solid majority of europeans were constantly expressing positive attitudes toward america only 30 percent on average had a negative opinion
5830125 by his policies habits demeanor and entire being bush represents to elite europeans the quintessential ugly american arrogant uncouth uncultured ignorant inconsiderate and aggressive
5830126 a life long affinity with the democratic left in europe and the united states
5830127 bush and his administrations policies have made america into the most hated country of all time
5830128 ambivalence antipathy and resentment toward and about the united states have comprised an important component of european culture since the american revolution at the latest thus way before america became the worlds mr big the proverbial eight hundred pound gorilla and a credible rival to europes main powers particularly britain and france while the politics style and discourse of the bush administration and of george w bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone disappearance
5830129 eastern europeans overwhelmingly positive views of america stem largely from their having perceived the united states as their sole ally against the much despised soviet union
5830130 my anti americanism has become almost uncontrollable it has possessed me like a disease it rises in my throat like acid reflux
5830131 as a generalized and comprehensive normative dislike of america and things american that often lacks distinct reasons or concrete causes
5830132 to this day one encounters the widely held view in europe that americans are like children implying they are immature impressionable without sound judgment anchorless lacking tradition or history
5830133 cannot claim any greatness because it has no history has little experience and it has not yet truly suffered
5830134 too religious too secular too idealistic too materialistic too elitist too populist too prudish too pornographic too individualistic too conformist too anarchic too controlling too obsessed with history not having any history too concerned with culture not having any culture too dominated by women too controlling of women america in the view of some europeans is so obsessed with freedom and individualism that this obsession impedes genuine individuality
5830135 when the americans dont come they exhibit arrogance by their aloofness when they do come and win too much they exhibit arrogance by their domination
5830136 it was the fear and critique of capitalist modernity that brought these two resentments together america and the jews were seen as paragons of modernity money driven profit hungry urban universalistic individualistic mobile rootless and hostile to established traditions and values
5830137 bemoan a loss of agency a seeming self incapacitation vis vis americas cunning and compelling ways which are clearly experienced as dangerous and undesirable but against which one appears to be helpless
5830138 widow of the most excellent gobernador don rodrigo de quiroga conquistador and founder of the kingdom of chile
5830139 in plasencia in the north of extremadura a border city steeped in war and religion
5830140 but any similarity to events and persons relating to the conquest of chile is not coincidental
5830141 the feats of in s su rez noted by the chroniclers of her era were nearly ignored by historians for more than four hundred years
5830142 merely strung them together with a fine thread of imagination
5830143 one of those handsome happy men no woman can resist at first but later wishes another woman would win away because he causes so much pain
5830144 my friend and my confidante the one person who knows my secrets including some that out of modesty i did not share with your father
5830145 i beg you to have a little patience isabel you will soon see that this disorderly narrative will come to the moment when my path crosses that of pedro de valdivia and the epic i want to tell you about begins before that i had been an insignificant seamstress in plasencia like the hundreds and hundreds of hardworking women who came here before and will come after me with pedro de valdivia i lived a life of legend and with him i conquered a kingdom although i adored rodrigo de quiroga your father and lived with him thirty years the only real reason for telling my story is the conquest of chile which i shared with pedro de valdivia
5830146 a man of about sixty haughty with sallow skin a graying beard sunken eyes with a suspicious gleam in them and a disagreeable falsetto voice
5830147 a pathetic group only eleven soldiers in addition to pedro de valdivia and me for i was prepared to wield a sword if the occasion demanded it
5830148 in payment for his services pizarro had allotted him for his lifetime a silver mine in porco a fertile and productive hacienda in la canela valley and hundreds of indians to work them
5830149 to populate chile with spaniards and to evangelize the indians
5830150 glory always glory that was the lodestar of his life
5830151 the chilean indians called us huincas which in their language mapudungu means lying people and land thieves valdivia was indignant about the stupidity of the spaniards who were killing off the peoples of the new world without the natives he always said the land has no value he died without seeing an end to the slaughter which has been going on for forty years now spaniards keep coming and mestizos keep being born but the mapuche are disappearing exterminated by war slavery and the illnesses brought by the spaniards which they cannot withstand
5830152 i could not live without him one day without seeing him and i was feverish a night without being in his arms was torment at first more than love i felt a blind reckless passion for him which fortunately he returned
5830153 was different from the desire i had felt for juan de m laga and my passion for pedro de valdivia it was a mature joyful sentiment without conflict that became more intense with the passing of time until i could not live without him
5830154 need to live in turbulence if it wasnt drinking and women it was the way he worked
5830155 johns life had become a high wire act he was flirting with his subtle foe suicide in the certainty that there was an invisible net held by me which would catch him should he lose his footing the job of net holder had exhausted me more important i realized that by making myself available in this way i had been encouraging him to be more and more incautious less vigilant against the current that was threatening to suck him under
5830156 the emotions i had expected to feel on separation the predictable anger and bitterness at the failure of a marriage were smothered under a blanket of grief
5830157 what he had been rehearsing at least as far back as the night of our engagement party he jumped from a railing this time of a bridge with no net and the frozen mississippi river below
5830158 the writing of which he said quoting delmore was a vocation it demanded and should have a poets whole attention he must be engaged in it with his whole being but how could he john be so engaged when he had to earn a living
5830159 he liked teaching was good at it also liked the boys but the important thing the real thing the only thing was to write poetry all else was wasted time
5830160 responsibility toward marriage vs responsibility toward art became a serious conflict for one who was almost as ambitious to be a good husband as a good poet
5830161 no amount of love and care could protect him from external circumstances and that these could bring him to the edge of madness
5830162 he was touched to hear me say what he already knew that i too had never been happier
5830163 this simpson subsequently realized was their last prolonged period of happiness
5830164 one hears so much talk about the competitiveness of poets that ive often wondered are they any more competitive than astronauts art collectors assistant professors jockeys hostesses ballet dancers professional beauties i doubt it in the years during which john and his contemporaries were making their reputations what impressed me was the generosity with which they offered one another advice praise and encouragement as those of their generation neared the finish line and saw how few there were left in the race they kept a close eye on one anothers positions of course and rivalry undoubtedly became as keen with them as with any other finalists with only a few prizes worth having how could it not be so
5830165 the litany of suicides among poets is long after a while i began to feel that id missed the obvious it was the poetry that had kept him alive
5830166 ive won pennants and finished dead last ive set attendance records and been close to bankruptcy at the age of fifteen i was taking care of ladies day passes at wrigley field i owned my first ball club when i was twenty eight i have operated five clubs three in the major leagues and two in the minors and in three of the towns i won pennants and broke attendance records two of the three teams to beat the yankees since i came to the american league in 1946 were my teams the 1948 cleveland indians and the 1959 chicago white sox the only other team the 1954 indians was made up for the most part of my old players
5830167 i would still be remembered in the end as the man who sent a midget up to bat
5830168 made his living by displaying himself the only way we permit a midget to earn a living in our enlightened society
5830169 with a father who ran a ball club my boyhood was the kind most kids dream about
5830170 i have read an average of five books a week i read everything my tastes being both catholic and indiscriminate i have the literary digestion of a garbage disposal unit
5830171 could work harder and longer than anybody else was apparently willing to work
5830172 i have been fighting against the status quo against the tyranny of the fossilized majority rule
5830173 absolutely the worst triple a team i had ever seen
5830174 a ramshackle rundown wooden park which had not seen a fresh coast of paint in 17 years
5830175 milwaukee was the great time of my life what can you say about a city after you have said that milwaukee was my proving grounds it was the place where i tried out all my ideas the good and the bad without the terrible pressure to succeed that comes with a major league franchise milwaukee was all fun even when i was running around from loan company to loan company it was all light all laughter
5830176 always cut a hole in my wooden leg you go through a couple a year and used it as an ashtray
5830177 in the following unheroic sweaty ways 1 we gave them a lot of fun and entertainment 2 i hit the chautauqua trail making as many as 500 speeches a year 3 we built a winning team
5830178 in our three and a half years in cleveland every day was mardi gras and every fan was king
5830179 owner of indians browns and white sox created heightened fan interest at every stop with ingenious promotional schemes fan participation exploding scoreboard outrageous door prizes names on uniforms a champion of the little guy
5830180 were expected to marry young have many children and devote themselves exclusively to the family
5830181 did not attend universities or enter the professions and in mississippi unlike new jersey they had never voted and were not expected to have the faintest interest in public life in return for such self denial women were supposed to receive security they gave up autonomy in exchange for protection
5830182 if a man did not honor the sacred vows of marriage if he neglected his wife or failed to provide for her what should she do should she defy social convention even at the cost of scandal or should she submit endure and hope for the best as her mother did how should a woman strike a balance between devotion to others and her duty to herself what if anything did a woman owe herself in addition to what she owed family and household these questions lingered as she approached adulthood for she identified strongly with women but wanted the security that men and only certain men could deliver
5830183 expected her to abide by his wishes which he said was demanded by her duties as a wife
5830184 wanted a reciprocal relationship a companionate marriage in which husband and wife both had obligations
5830185 the role of the southern lady although it was only a generation old had great political valence and the confederate elite expected davis to conform to it she should embody the values of the planter class as her husband seemed to do but she did not talk like a first lady for she was too well read too smart and too blunt mrs daviss sense of humor which was evident in her debut summer in 1861 also became a liability she was a good mimic and after she did some impersonation at a party that summer one onlooker thought she should make such demonstrations in private the confederate elite might have overlooked mrs daviss shortcomings the wrong appearance the wrong sense of humor the wrong manners if she had fully supported the southern cause
5830186 the norths advantage in population and manufacturing power was immense
5830187 resignation a desire to conform and a determination to endure with none of the fiery enthusiasm for the cause that her peers might hope for from the first lady
5830188 now she was the wife of a prisoner whom many white southerners saw as a martyr for his cause which mitigated much of the animosity toward him and her at her new orleans hotel she was inundated with callers and shopkeepers would not accept her money the outpouring overwhelmed her the richmond complaints about her crudeness vanished and her lack of enthusiasm for the southern cause was forgotten or overlooked she had become in the latest incarnation a symbol of the confederacy
5830189 leviathan proportions as he assumed a new role as symbol of the lost cause as the southern effort came to be called

5830207 candidacy in its most easily understandable form terminator for governor simplified politics and infantilizes the electorate
5830208 there were certainly political reasons to mistrust schwarzenegger his was a masquerade candidacy like so many political events in recent years schwarzeneggers run was portrayed as the opposite of what it was the campaign pretended to be for the popular good when it merely furthered the status quo alleged it would help the little guy when it clearly was intended to make things easier and better for business interests used the mask of tax givebacks and a no new taxes platform as a populist cover up for its corporate underpinnings

5830216 constrained by my duties and loyalty to the president and unable to comment but i promised reporters and the public that i would someday tell the whole story of what i knew
5830217 ive written it not to settle scores or enhance my own role
5830218 but simply to record what i know and what i learned

5830222 the first time when i felt i was witnessing bush convincing himself to believe something that probably was not true and that deep down he knew was not true in the years to come as i worked closely with president bush i would come to believe that sometimes he convinces himself to believe what suits his needs at the moment

5830232 to dramatize the troubled story of the protestant church school my headmaster would have to be a much more complicated character than endicott peabody he would have to have moments of doubt to balance his faith he would have to see his school as a mountain of vanity as well as a monastery he would have to be intellectual cultivated occasionally cynical sometimes cruel always clever if dr peabody had his moments of despair they didnt show i wanted my man to be tortured in his brilliant success by constantly having to question its validity and at times to despise even his own teachers and pupils for their failure to make his ideals seem as shining as he had aspired to make them i wanted him to be humble and vain to be st francis of assisi and king lear on the heath i wanted him to express the agony of failing ridiculously when he wanted at the very least to fail magnificently and i wanted him to raise the question no more than that if he had failed at all

5830236 prescott was surrounded with an atmosphere of almost incredible awe to which the parents trustees and faculty all contributed i do not think that many of the boys liked him but they respected and feared him which was much more fun both for them and for him they were proud of his fame excited by the rumble of his leadership and diverted by his wit his inconsistencies even by his sermons as i have said he was basically a ham actor and the school was a captured but still admiring audience
5830237 well devils have a way of having the last word you know particularly with those who are making a peepshow of gods mercy who are using gods things as props in vaudeville and so it was that your beautiful academy your palace of lies should have at last a graduate a moral graduate shall we say who carries your act to its ultimate degree and shatters for a gaping multitude the great glass window of your idolatry
5830238 i see that justin martyr is like the other schools only i of course ever thought it was different only i failed to see that snobbishness and materialism were intrinsic in its make up only i was na ve enough to think i could play with that kind of fire and not get my hands burnt
5830239 he knew his capacity to be petty vain tyrannical vindictive even cruel he fully recognized his propensity to self dramatization and his habit of sacrificing individuals to the imagined good of his school yet he also saw at all times and with perfect clarity that his own peculiar genius was for persuading his fellow men that life could be exciting and that god wanted them to find it so

5830273 new orleans was the most marvelous city in the spanish country or anywhere else on the river beauty and vice and every delight possible to the soul and body stood hospitably and usually together in every doorway and beneath every palmetto by day and lighted torch by night a shutter opened and a flower bloomed the very atmosphere was nothing but aerial spice the very walls were sugar cane the very clouds hung as golden as bananas in the sky but clement musgrove was a man who could have walked the streets of baghdad without sending a second glance overhead at the magic carpet or heard the tambourines of the angels in paradise without dancing a step or had his choice of the fruits of the garden of eden without making up his mind for he was an innocent of the wilderness and a planter of rodneys landing and this was his good

5830277 the fastest kidnapping that had ever been in that part of the country
5830278 the red horse stood stock still and jamie lockhart lifted rosamond down the wild plum trees were like rolling smoke between him and the river but he broke the branches and the plums rained down as he carried her under he stopped and laid her on the ground where straight below the river flowed as slow as sand and robbed her of that which he had left her the day before
5830279 sometimes she would wake up out of her first sleep and study his sleeping face but she did not know the language it was written in the only thing that divided his life from hers was the raiding and the robbing that he did but that was like his other life that she could not see and so she contented herself with loving all that was visible and present of him as much as she was able

5830281 that old buffalo trail where travelers passed along and were set upon by the bandits and the indians and torn apart by the wild animals
5830282 a woman beside her sobbed without restraint but joyce felt something erupt inside her something warm very much like yes it was a pang of pleasure so intense it was nearly like the appeasement of hunger it was a giddiness an elation the deep bellied roar of the towers collapse finally reached her and went on for minutes it seemed followed by an unnaturally warm gust that pushed back her hair and ruffled her blouse the building turned into a rising mushroom shaped column of smoke dust and perished life and she felt a great gladness
5830283 which had just been removed whole from the face of the earth
5830284 been instructed to communicate with each other only through their lawyers an injunction impossible to obey since joyce and marshall still shared a two bedroom apartment with their two small children and a yapping emotionally needy razor nailed springer spaniel
5830285 to ruin him not only financially but personally and not just for now but forever
5830286 he could have written sonnets of hatred made vows on his hatred performed daring heroic feats of physical labor to prove his hatred
5830287 feelings between joyce and marshall acquired the intensity of something historic tribal and ethnic and when they watched news of wars on tv reports from the balkans or the west bank they would think yes yes yes thats how i feel about you

5830291 would stand on a randomly selected street corner and think of joyce and how thoroughly their lives had been ruined what had he done to her why did he deserve this why did she hate him so
5830292 their divorce negotiations had stalled again court dates were set and postponed the lawyers continued to coo and bill and then nothing would be decided still they lived together every once in a while an outside party would come up with a stratagem to break the deadlock a simultaneous exchange of major concessions a splitting of the differences but joyce and marshall closed ranks against it their positions had shifted shape to exactly meet and oppose the contours of each others interests their apartment was the world of derangement and chaos
5830293 she had been a strange girl immature he thought as fresh and fragile as a newly independent nation liberated from colonial misrule she was still composing her constitution finding allies striking new emotional coinage and rediscovering and rewriting her past marshall had been required to learn her obscure language
5830294 although she hated him with every cell in her body she didnt believe he was a bad man not really she had loved him once and the memory was a little traitor sabotaging her every effort to survive this divorce he had nursed her through a month of meningitis before they were married bringing her wonton soup and a single red rose every night after work at violas birth he had gently lifted the girl from the bloody sheet and laid her on joyces chest

5830296 plenty of psychologists not least freud wholl tell you that collecting is an anal compulsion
5830297 he says that orderliness obstinacy and parsimony are the three traits that go along with anal eroticism the need to keep and the refusal to give is sic what adults do as a substitute for the childhood habit of retaining feces we gather objects or indeed money because we cant bear to part with our dung

5830303 lately cynthias been doing female breasts which are so much easier she said a less tricky shape to cast no breakages and no erection to be sustained i can see that must be satisfying and i can imagine that plenty of people would be happy to have molds of the breasts of peaches or laetitia sadier from stereolab but somehow they just dont seem quite as collectible as penises

5830315 as obvious a moral affront as slavery appears today there was no consensus on the evils inherent to slavery at the time moses freed his slaves in 1773 opposition to slavery was in fact espoused by a tiny minority controversial even among the quakers and considered heretical by theologians and political thinkers on both sides of the atlantic in the west indies in particular but also in north and south america slavery was the engine that drove the mercantile empires of europe the institution was as old as time finding explicit sanction in the bible and in the glory days of greece and rome and had flourished in its modern form for two hundred years it appeared in the eighteenth century as universal and immutable as human nature
5830316 unlike many fellow abolitionists moses saw blacks not just as pitiable objects for philanthropy but as equal to whites in every human capacity

5830320 embraced the role of ever ready alter ego dogging moses even ridiculing him in his quest for spiritual atonement
5830321 moses never broke with john never even rebuked him for his public attacks on his character it was as if john had become the first object in moses mission of spiritual atonement if he could not bring his own brother to share his sense of moral obligation how could he expect to reform an entire nation

5830358 if meeting celeste post boyfriend was like arriving in russia in march 1917 hopeful march after the tsars abdication the appointment of the provisional government the short lived democratic process then they were well into anarchic june or even forbidding july was gwyn his kerensky his kornilov ekh ultimately these historical parallels were of limited use in figuring out your personal life
5830359 henrys theft was no different than that by scores of others before him and yet in a fundamental way it was he did not steal one seed or even a hundred he stole seventy thousand thirty four years after henrys theft the british rubber grown in the
5830360 that year the british plantations turned the corner and produced 47 618 tons of high quality acetate cured rubber compared to brazils 39 370 tons in 1916 brazil produced as much as ever but the game had now changed in three more years british plantations would produce enough hevea to fill 95 percent of the worlds need for high quality rubber such fantastic supply seemed unimaginable just a few years earlier and the price plummeted from the 3 06 high in 1910 to 66 cents per pound in 1915 by 1921 when great britain controlled the world market plantation rubber sold for 12 21 cents a pound
5830361 is about power and its imbalance the historical fact that poorer countries have been high in resources while richer nations want and can take what they have
5830362 became a symbol for every act of exploitation visited on the third world
5830363 the explorer was a central hero in an escape fantasy that gripped the british isles a champion who trod the earths wild places and interpreted what he saw through english eyes
5830364 poor frightfully poor spending most of his time at the royal colonial club surrounded by fellow imperialists each spinning their separate tales
5830365 a large framed idealist dreamy sympathetic artistic a great wanderer and naturalist in tropical america but not well qualified for official or commercial business
5830366 it had become obvious that with the discovery of vulcanization rubber would be the worlds most useful plastic
5830367 the three great developments dependent on rubber electricity bicycles and automobiles increased its worldwide demand at a rate that nearly doubled production every five then every three years
5830368 a true believer in the british doctrine of world transformation that natures secrets could be secured and replanted all for the improvement of man the empire and her queen
5830369 in the first month we called a list of names to fill in and i was so excited out of the four people i called all of them knew where oscar was located no one said i dont want to come to that church its too far out in the country that gave me a really positive attitude i know god is really working
5830370 its really a shame we have all of these small churches built in one area when it would be better if we were all together
5830371 but who wants to close the doors of their church
5830372 in the methodist church we are reaching a national crisis in the next four years we will have a significant number of ministers retiring the population of the u s is aging mainline denominations are now reflective of that aging were trying to do more recruitment to encourage young people to consider ministry
5830373 you work long hard hours to do it just for your own self satisfaction of doing a good job and you dont make a lot of money you can work 50 to 60 hours a week easily its not an easy job but its a rewarding job now you have insurance and pension all those other costs make it harder for the smaller churches to afford pastors
5830374 communities just left and theres nothing left but the church and the church is in the middle of nowhere its something were dealing with
5830375 fewer guys are going in the ministry at this point were trying to figure it out too i dont know the answer we have several preachers but a lot of them dont seem interested in being pastors they dont want to go out and pastor and leave their own church
5830376 and a lot of these small churches dont want pastors who could fill their small church because they dont have the educational experience years ago some men might not have had a high school diploma but they were still called to preach
5830377 there was a time when they didnt have a retirement and they had to keep preaching
5830378 the young people dont seem to be going into preaching like they did
5830379 a lot of them are not sound in the doctrine big changes are going on through the country and the world with religious outlooks and beliefs the young generation coming up doesnt want to worship like we do they want more entertainment than serving the lord
5830380 i know a preacher cant preach and do the social work he needs to do and work too
5830381 i think the few members weve got need to get together in some prayer service and get ourselves dedicated or the lord isnt going to bless us
5830382 scholarly pendulum has a way of swinging from one side to the other
5830383 has produced more interpretive disputes than most other historical subjects next to debates about the causes of the war arguments about how or why the north won or the confederacy lost the difference in phraseology is significant have generated some of the most heated but also most enlightening scholarship since the centennial commemorations of the war
5830384 a basic trait of character evident throughout lincolns life the essential passivity of his nature
5830385 recognizing that the facts mostly do not fit the passivity thesis donald wisely allows it to fade away as the book proceeds
5830386 both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came
5830387 why did the war come what were the war aims of each side what strategies did they employ to achieve these aims how do we evaluate the leadership of both sides did the wars outcome justify the immense sacrifice of lives what impact did the experience of war have on the people who lived through it how did later generations remember and commemorate that experience
5830388 despite shermans reputation in the south as a ferocious ogre of vengeance and spoliation he was actually sparing of the lives of his own soldiers of the enemys soldiers and of civilians
5830389 for the war as a whole lees army had a higher casualty rate than the armies commanded by grant the romantic glorification of the army of northern virginia by generations of lost cause writers has obscured this truth
5830390 it was not the existence of slavery that polarized the nation to the breaking point
5830391 but rather the issue of the expansion of slave territory
5830392 was so deeply rooted in american society that it required the huge violence of the civil war to root it out
5830393 what both contemporaries and later commentators have chosen to see in jesse james robin hood social bandit scourge of capitalism
5830394 an ethic of sacrifice the noblesse oblige conviction that the privileged classes had a greater obligation to defend the country precisely because of the privileged status they enjoyed
5830395 it was represented in almost every field of human inquiry of communications and of academic study in fact as the third millennium got under way it was clear to all but the most myopic that biography had become the most popular and in many ways the most controversial and contested area of nonfiction broadcasting and publishing in the western world epitomized by todays burgeoning weblogs on line diaries in which individuals thoughts and experiences are published in electronic form
5830396 the dramatist john dryden first referred to biography as a collective noun
5830397 virtually all early societies and civilizations have sought to record themselves through the memorialization of distinct individuals often in poems and songs which were handed down from generation to generation
5830398 the first literary biography ever written dating back to the second millennium b c
5830399 the eternal questions that hang over biographical portraiture to this very day
5830400 showed a return to the classical struggle between on the one hand the commemoration of the dead as a continuing spur to more moral behavior by the living and on the other the need to be able to identify with the trials and tribulations of another mortal individuals life journey as an aid to modern self understanding even self acceptance
5830401 those two fat volumes with which it is our custom to commemorate the dead who does not know them with their ill digested masses of material their slipshod style their tone of tedious panegyric their lamentable lack of selection of detachment of design they are as familiar as the cort ge of the undertaker and wear the same air of slow funereal barbarism
5830402 attached as he was to his own armchair comfort as a writer rather than a researcher
5830403 became free to examine record and interpret the lives of prominent living individuals with impunity so long as there was no reckless or malicious disregard for the truth
5830404 for biography in the western world this was a decision that would affect every biographical and autobiographical work produced thereafter freeing authors and broadcasters portraitists and biographical journalists within reason to come into the twentieth century and to fulfill samuel johnsons vision of biography as an account that included both virtue and vice the former frontier posts of biography as the printed record of whole lives were now kicked down as artists writers filmmakers broadcasters researchers and others sought in every medium to discover and interpret more about the lives of individuals for a variety of motives that ranged from the political to the personal
5830405 people dont usually think about these types of cells when they talk about human embryonic stem cell therapy but it is important
5830406 theres more infections all the time and the number of donors is more and more limited
5830407 whether they would be good enough for transfusion is very unclear
5830408 anyone who has ever been in the limelight even for participating in a high school musical or telling a good story at a cocktail party can attest to the fact that there is a rush that comes with commanding everyones attention
5830409 isnt it possible that many behaviors related to fame including becoming famous being near the famous and even reading about the famous trigger a rush that is potentially addictive
5830410 why do countless americans yearn so desperately for this sort of fame why do others such as celebrity personal assistants devote their entire lives to serving these people and why do millions of others fall into the mindless habit of watching them from afar
5830411 a family of four attending an imta convention could easily spend 10 000
5830412 to fervently hope that becoming a celebrity would right these wrongs
5830413 a steady supply of telegenic actors singers cooks talk show hosts and meteorologists to fill the increasing number of celebrity slots
5830414 the celebrity pool has expanded in order to provide names to fill the increasing number of column inches currently devoted to gossip this is my own pet theory and i use it to explain all sorts of things one of whom is halston
5830415 most assistants describe the bulk of their work as drudgery doing laundry fetching groceries paying bills and unlike lawyers and agents who rub shoulders with the stars and often make millions of dollars assistants are not paid particularly well
5830416 a problem with this job sometimes there is a loss of self
5830417 a definite quid pro quo in these relationships followers get a sense of belonging security and importance and leaders feed off their admiration and devotion
5830418 i just had such a terrible childhood that i never wanted to have children i guess i didnt get a whole lot of love or acknowledgment as a kid and thats something i seek when i go to a rod concert
5830419 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5830420 the magnitude of the weakness this quarter was a surprise

5830425 has pushed this war from the beginning they are so well organized and their members are extraordinarily powerful most of them are quite wealthy they have been able to exert power
5830426 it is never easy nor pleasant to criticize a fellow democrat but sometimes it is necessary while there is nothing wrong with criticizing aipac or for that matter any organization with which you disagree spreading false statements is clearly irresponsible
5830427 rep morans comments are not only incorrect and irresponsible they are downright dangerous
5830428 the congressman understands that the tone of some of his comments in the interview with tikkun an interfaith progressive jewish magazine may have been unnecessarily harsh however he stands by his message namely that for the last few years aipac has not represented mainstream american jewish opinion and that the organizations middle east policies while in direct alignment with the bush administration have been counterproductive to israels long term security
5830429 recognizes the progressive nature of the jewish community as a whole and notes that if the rest of america voted the way jews vote the u s would not be in the war in iraq today and would have health care for all and would not be involved in discriminatory treatment of gays or of immigrants
5830430 members are willing to be very generous with their personal wealth but its a two edged sword if you cross aipac aipac is unforgiving and will destroy you politically their means of communications their ties to certain newspapers and magazines and to individuals in the media are substantial and intimidating
5830431 willow run will be cited at grandfathers knee as the very type of majesty before which other nations bow their heads in envy but i have told its melancholy story because it symbolizes the grandiosity that is to other nations the most unpleasant of all american traits the unbridled promise the wild freedom of untested assumption the invitation to share the cornucopia that is stuffed with the peculiar american riches such unique things the native honestly believes as devilish ingenuity wedded to unequaled material and spiritual resources what exacerbates the foreigners annoyance is his secret awareness that there is an uncomfortable measure of truth in the boast
5830432 just as brashness is the abuse of the northerners liveliness this looks like the dark dull underside of southern manners
5830433 the chipping of the pine for its gum which is then distilled into turpentine and resin is a negro monopoly for the commonest and most wearisome reason it is work thought unfit for whites
5830434 none too proud of the showing we had made in running the first compulsory migration of american citizens in american history not counting the indians
5830435 ordinary people talk very little about the strategy of the war or indeed about the battles lost and won but think first and always about the way the war affects their work
5830436 gone off to better pay in the east coast shipyards
5830437 there will be fewer snow scenes till the war is over
5830438 was now a navy indoctrination school and training center for the supply corps
5830439 almost no relevant experience when it came to carving a settlement out of the american wilderness
5830440 stood squatted or sat on the ground as they clustered around outdoor fires where the deer and birds turned on wooden spits and where pottages stews into which varieties of meats and vegetables were thrown simmered invitingly
5830441 believed it was necessary to venture back to the absolute beginning of christianity before the church had been corrupted by centuries of laxity and abuse to locate divine truth
5830442 the children of the devil full of all subtlety and malice
5830443 during the forty five months of world war ii the united states lost just under 1 percent of its adult male population
5830444 appear almost inconsequential when compared to those of the indians
5830445 at least 2 000 had been killed in battle or died of their injuries 3 000 had died of sickness and starvation 1 000 had been shipped out of the country as slaves while an estimated 2 000 eventually fled to either the iroquois to the west or the abenakis to the north overall the native american population of southern new england had sustained a loss of somewhere between 60 and 80 percent
5830446 thanksgiving and its reassuring image of indian english cooperation became the predominant myth of the pilgrims in the american popular imagination the nations history began with the pilgrims and then leapfrogged more than 150 years to lexington and concord and the revolution
5830447 were growing older and their stories would soon be lost forever
5830448 they missed the cream of the crop when i say the cream of the crop if they had taken the fellows say around 1932 or 33 they would have had some outstanding players they would have got the chance to see cool papa bell run and they would have had the chance to see oscar charleston play oscar charleston was the willie mays of that era feared no pitcher just a wonderful wonderful all around baseball player so they missed all that it is just too bad that they didnt start earlier
5830449 because we thought if they integrated baseball they were going to start integrating other things
5830450 wasnt the best ballplayer we had in the negro league
5830451 supposedly i roomed with satch while he was with cleveland but i roomed with his luggage
5830452 as far as baseball goes its a clean cut game everything is right there before you you see everything and the integrity of the game had been unblemished and outstanding during our days im not overly pleased about what has happened in recent years with the labor strikes and strikes which should never have happened the fans took what happened previously but i dont think theyll take another one and i believe management and employees should be able to get together and iron this thing out the game was a national pastime for all those many years and those of us who played it years ago played really specifically first for the love of the game
5830453 i didnt think at the time that it would be any big deal
5830454 i admit i got arrested i put myself in the spotlight so to speak
5830455 but for them to keep me there for seven months to find out i was telling the truth come on thats a little much
5830456 and when information came to our attention that he was a naturalized u s citizen we released him
5830457 she told me that people say anything to get out of here
5830458 which means we would meet with people and give them advice on what they can do when they represent themselves
5830459 i was naturalized here in the seattle ins building your honor while i was in the service
5830460 sir you get documentation when you become a united states citizen
5830461 where is your documentation you simply say im a citizen you get a piece of paper
5830462 i dont think youre a united states citizen simply because you think that some paper was filed on your behalf
5830463 at one point i just figured there was nothing more i could do
5830464 its not because we think were making mistakes hand over fist
5830465 but more because we want to ensure were doing the job the best we can
5830466 the more the detention system and the more the whole process of enforcement happen the more we get these situations
5830467 this case highlights the issues but its not just about this one case its about the problems that exist when you put people in detention and they dont always have access to legal assistance
5830468 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5830469 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5830470 stagnating career as a lawyer specializing in the arcane rules and regulations of corporate and international tax law and in a desperate attempt to maintain some semblance of financial stability purchased the remnants of my parents retail business a neighborhood liquor store
5830471 a tiny cube on the corner of seventy second street and lexington avenue
5830472 the upper east side of manhattan a tony residential quarter
5830473 concept that the particulars of a zone the combination of soil climate grape type and perhaps human history are responsible for producing very special characteristics that are unique to a quite specific spot
5830474 this sentiment is the ultimate expression of someones love of the land recognition that nature is king and we are only its caretakers that land is eternal and we are not it is why i insist on working with estate bottled wines it is why i require our growers to be as specific as possible when labeling their wines so that our clients and the ultimate consumers of these hand made limited production wines can have a better understanding of the magic that takes place when the vine is planted in a special place and cared for by the proper steward
5830475 that nature makes the wine and man acts as its steward
5830476 a two week sabbatical in the berkshire hills of western massachusetts accompanied by several cases of wine and a bunch of books on the subject
5830477 no one ever taught me how to taste wine nor did i learn from someone else what is good and bad i brought my own talents developed my own standards and jumped into the fray i had no business plan instinct was my guide i naively believed that allegiance to quality would carry the day and i trusted my own taste i have always said that if i couldnt sell the wine i was purchasing at least i would be happy to drink it
5830478 i am curious about the new and different but i am most at home with the tried and true ultimately my portfolio of growers and their wines reflects my search for wines that are part of classical tradition as a result we may be out of the mainstream
5830479 a need to fashion wine that will be most appealing in its youth and brought to market rapidly
5830480 so much of todays brave new world of wine and food is often no more than a game of smoke and mirrors more bravado than substance a world where young chefs with a couple of years of study at a fancy food university display their lack of discipline by piling all their lessons before you on every plate and itinerant winemakers bring their formulas fresh from the laboratory to make wines of flash that cannot satisfy which have to be gobbled up instantly before the deception is discovered
5830481 far from being alone he belonged to the most numerous class in modern european society the class of those who had no choices of their own to make
5830482 he looked like hes been doing this for a while we think hes working in the charlotte and newton area but that the people making the ids are probably in charlotte
5830483 hes probably doing this four or five times a week for people theyre reaching out to our area almost like district salesmen people are taking orders to make these ids and are getting people to deliver them we believe hes probably one of the deliver people
5830484 they were very authentic if they were being examined by an officer at night in low light levels i could see someone being easily fooled i think they would fool most citizens and employers
5830485 were not pursuing anything else of this type but weve turned the investigation over to other law enforcement with a wider jurisdiction
5830486 we are pleased the university is pursuing an agreement that would make these records publicly available
5830487 the donors only concerns regarding the collection are due to personnel information that could include names confidential salary information and even social security numbers
5830488 sent an anonymous survey to over 150 women and got back an amazing 75 responses
5830489 far from the stereotypical fluffy barbie doll image under which nfl wives often suffer nfl women are sharp strong willed and opinionated and not afraid to speak their minds rather than being shallow or timid as they are sometimes portrayed they are as tough if not tougher than the men who play and coach the game they have to be those who arent dont last in the nfl for long while those who learn to cope with the nfls immense difficulties and challenges become stubborn resilient wise survivors
5830490 spent five years trying to make it into the nfl as a wide receiver
5830491 got his first job as an offensive assistant coach for the oakland raiders
5830492 many players pass through who are never quite good enough
5830493 but the nfl needs cheap bodies who will work hard for a promise and so they are encouraged to stick it out
5830494 the wife of a player told the story of arriving at a game wearing a t shirt with her husbands name on it after her husband drew a penalty for holding she said three men sitting a couple of rows behind her screamed at and humiliated her since then she hides the fact that she is an nfl woman
5830495 the question that truly challenges these women is how to maintain a sense of self and personal pride when everything they see hear and read praises their partners and their nfl jobs and leaves the womens contributions virtually invisible
5830496 i never had problems being called the wife i hear these young girls complain about that and when they ask me about it i will say if you want the honest to god truth it is like trying to turn around the titanic you are going to fight yourself you just need to accept it isnt about you right now the fans it will not be about you the team it will not be about you his schedule it will not be about you his coaches it will not be about you
5830497 every other child lives below the poverty line too many do not graduate and too many more do not find work some join gangs and others fall to their gunfire

5830499 her naturally forward placement strong resonators superb command of breath support and solid physique helped her to sing like an operatic tenor the sound moved up through her chest and resonated in her head with true tenorlike ping on the high notes
5830500 many in the west the midwest and the south people who had never experienced her live thanks to her dislike of touring regarded her from her records and tv appearances as crass vulgar and loud the vocal equivalent of a rusty saw
5830501 if she was going to wear a chest mike now a fixture on broadway
5830502 no we just want to keep it in the theater
5830503 she had crack comic timing and she instinctively knew the most important rule of comedy when you try to make it funny you usua ll y fall flat just play it straight and if the scene is any good at all it wi ll be funny
5830504 became excessively dependent on peter so much so that she almost began living through him
5830505 jean rogets early death had profound effects on his son though the young boy would keep his feelings to himself loss and the fear of loss were to shape the way peter saw the world the adult roget would reveal this lifelong struggle in a poignant list dates of deaths which he appended to the front of his list of principal events a telegraphic rendering of the major milestones of his life included are the names of about thirty people those family members and friends who meant the most to him its first two entries are jean roget 1783 and peter romilly 1784 by the time he was five peter was forced to cope with the unexpected deaths of both his beloved father and his doting grandfather
5830506 as a boy he stumbled upon a remarkable discovery that compiling lists of words could provide solace no matter what misfortunes might befall him he was particularly fond of cataloguing the objects both animate and inanimate in his environment as an adult he kept returning to the classification of words and concepts immersion in the nuances of language could invariably both energize him and keep his persistent anxiety at bay
5830507 classifying the world became an obsession that would preoccupy him for the rest of his life
5830508 had little to do with enjoyment but everything to do with the intellectual challenge of learning about order
5830509 to his extreme shyness and to what family members referred to as his melancholy temperament
5830510 peter would never show evidence of a literary sensibility those who love literature typically are fascinated with stories and storytelling but thats not how rogets mind worked lacking a vivid imagination he was a practical person since boyhood words always constituted the means to an end all of his scholarly publications including the thesaurus were directed toward disseminating scientific knowledge that ultimately had some useful purpose
5830511 a dispensary for outpatients a ward for the treatment of fever patients and a psychiatric facility then called a lunatic asylum
5830512 helped to found the northern dispensary a free clinic that served the indigent in several sections of london
5830513 he had been elected as one of the two secretaries of the royal society
5830514 he had begun the first of two one year terms as president of the medical and chirurgical society
5830515 beauty and brains plus considerable wealth a noteworthy attribute in an age where the husband automatically assumed control over his new wifes personal property
5830516 was the culmination of his lifelong pursuit begun in his childhood notebook to organize the animate world
5830517 did much more for its creator than it has done for its hundreds of millions of users across the centuries it enabled roget to live a vibrant life in the face of overwhelming loss anxiety and despair
5830518 i was like those expats who eat france out of camembert and croissants but continue to read sartre in english
5830519 i cannot rightly claim to have learned to make gumbo at the hip of paul prudhomme alas no amount of eating or cooking earns a nonnative membership in that society of louisianians who were born with roux in their genes and weaned on shellfish stocks and sticky bits of okra i continue to make chef pauls gumbo more than other styles but that has to do with comfort level not predisposition there is thankfully a silver lining to never belonging devoid of an inbred gumbo bias im open to appreciating the full spectrum of gumbos without the hindrance of a gold standard its a great luxury in a town like this one

5830529 got accepted into a residency program at the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia after katrina blew his career path right out of new orleans
5830530 its important to remember and ive reminded myself every day how many people have not been able to return to their city since katrina to eat a po boy or to see a friend for reasons too many to list i have had the luxury of a long peaceful farewell and i am grateful for it
5830531 the number and diversity of people who are extremely bothered by the facts and the perception of the implementation of 287 g is vast and quickly gaining momentum nationally and locally

5830534 i do not believe that sheriff johnson or his staff is overstepping their bounds
5830535 but people who break the laws and enter our country illegally obtain illegal social security numbers and commit other incidents are breaking the laws of our country and should be held accountable
5830536 what has happened to our country our state and our county when a government employee cannot report a felony crime
5830537 this is absurd and goes against the very moral fiber that our country was founded upon
5830538 if you want to come here illegally and live in this country do not violate any laws
5830539 but as long as im sheriff i am going to do my job commissioners and the only thing that you can do is cut my budget
5830540 had gotten people stirred up by saying the sheriffs office profiles
5830541 the needs of the few outweigh the needs of the many
5830542 somebody whos ambulatory they have more options available than somebody whos using a mobility device
5830543 gives elderly or disabled people the freedom to participate in education and jobs and take care of their necessities nobody questioned that
5830544 but it is going to take a bigger and bigger bite out of ltds general fund and regular bus service is going to suffer until we find a solution
5830545 because use of ride source is somewhat uncontrollable and with the growing cost of those trips theres no way we can manage that
5830546 it can be daunting if youve never ridden the bus or even had one bad experience
5830547 we bridge that gap we work with them one to one until theyre comfortable
5830548 its good transportation i can get around i can go wherever i want to go
5830549 this transaction provides tremendous benefits to cvs caremark by accelerating our expansion in very attractive drugstore markets and strengthening our geographic reach
5830550 with this acquisition we will increase accessibility to our pharmacies for consumers and put us in an even better position to grow our pharmacy offerings
5830551 the affirmation reflects the fact that longs will provide cvs with a meaningful presence in california in which cvs is currently under penetrated and cvs history of successfully integrating acquisitions
5830552 osco sav on was the dominant brand in southern california longs is the leading brand in northern california
5830553 the consumer in the west uses it more as a general store
5830554 truly has become a highly visible company in virtually every market in the u s
5830555 when its all said and done there will be only a handful of major retailers in the pharmacy business there will be more competition but it will be among the giants
5830556 sort of like the automotive industry there will only be a handful of companies left
5830557 it was a big drop off after numbers one two and three
5830558 its hard to break into the big contracts we had scale on the pharmacy side of the business what we needed was scale on the pbm side of the business
5830559 the pbms in the country were beginning to see it
5830560 there was a realization with the pbms that that was the next step
5830561 you have the largest integrated pharmacy service provider in the world headquartered here

5830563 mundus the most reliable and predictable person in this building and probably in the whole history of the school working here for more than thirty years impeccable in his profession a pillar of the institution a little boring perhaps but respected and even feared in the university for his astounding knowledge of ancient languages mocked lovingly by his students who put him to the test every year by calling him in the middle of the night and asking him about the conjecture for a remote passage in an ancient text only to get every time off the top of his head information that was both dry and exhaustive including a critical commentary with other possible meanings all of it presented perfectly and calmly without a soup on of anger at the disturbance mundus a man with an impossibly old fashioned even archaic first name you simply had to abbreviate and couldnt abbreviate any other way an abbreviation that revealed the character of the man as no other word could have for what he carried around in him as a philologist was in fact no less than a whole world or rather several whole worlds since along with those latin and greek passages his head also held the hebrew that had amazed several old testament scholars
5830564 found it last year in the junk box of a secondhand bookshop in lisbon
5830565 do wrong to thyself do wrong to thyself my soul but later thou wilt no longer have the opportunity of respecting and honoring thyself for every man has but one life but yours is nearly finished though in it you had no regard for yourself but placed thy felicity in the souls of others but those who do not observe the impulses of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy
5830566 id like to make something different out of my life
5830567 my time is running out and there may not be much more of it left
5830568 poet and a language mystic who had taken up arms and fought against salazar
5830569 id like to know what it was like to be him
5830570 what it is like when you imagined being the other person
5830571 was it possible that the best way to make sure of yourself was to know and understand someone else one whose life had been completely different and had had a completely different logic than your own how did curiosity for another life go together with the awareness that your own time was running out
5830572 had lived alone in this house for thirty one years thirty one years alone with the memories and the emptiness left behind by the brother
5830573 thought things through to the end he always thought them through to the end no matter how black the consequences were

5830577 the smell was so strong that i thought somebody must have been smoking in the car
5830578 at first i thought it could have still been the previous passengers although that would have been illegal too
5830579 i didnt really look at the roof number because i was kind of shocked
5830580 you have a responsibility to report it thats why i ended up calling the police about this
5830581 i was home safe so it wasnt about me it was just about other people getting in with him

5830583 i leave a message in the evening but in the morning the drivers going to be sober and off the road
5830584 a woman said they couldnt do anything if i didnt have the roof number or the licence plate which i was really upset at myself about i felt kind of guilty for not knowing it
5830585 as soon as i mentioned the smell and all that stuff he got really really defensive and started almost yelling at me and saying that it was probably the passengers that were high as a kite
5830586 unfortunately i will say our dispatcher handled this the wrong way in our opinion at this stage
5830587 i call the driver in check the driver out check the car out
5830588 if i thought the driver was indeed high on drugs he would no longer be employed here
5830589 i would have perceived it as an impaired driving complaint
5830590 there would actually be nothing we could do about it at this point because it was two days ago
5830591 to charge someone with impaired driving you need to have them within two hours
5830592 was the driver operating the vehicle erratically i doubt it probably he was driving the exact speed limit maybe a little slower making complete stops at stop signs and generally following all traffic laws
5830593 marijuana affects many skills required for safe driving alertness ability to concentrate coordination and reaction time these effects can last up to 24 hours after smoking marijuana
5830594 marijuana intoxication can cause distorted perceptions impaired coordination difficulty in thinking and problem solving and problems with learning and memory

5830610 not buying is becoming a habit when im picking up groceries at the co op i dont even think about grabbing an egg roll from the cooler when im driving i have no impulse to stop for coffee i dont read magazine ads even for movies and i peruse the mail order catalogues casually like a woman declining the advances of a lover who no longer thrills her for their parts j crew j jill l l bean and my other suitors seem to have sensed my cooling affections and are responding with heightening ardor more catalogues more e mail announcements of special sales more missives asking where i have been

5830620 gabriel thanks for bringing this discussion to everyones attention i must admit that i had to go to the bookstore to pick up the magazine after i read your post because i let my subscription expire oops i only had the attention span to read through part of the discussion but one of the major threads i noticed was the complaint that much of the work in the eip wasnt made of metal to that i can only reply that there is a long history of jewelry made from other materials and anyone who thinks that metalsmith should cover only metal jewelry should pick up the book africa adorned but onto the bigger issue which is snag itself i dont think snag needs a name change so much as a reclarification of its mission what is snags mission anyway there is no way that snag can please every category of jeweler maker metalsmith etc and its stupid for them to even try if snag metalsmith wants to focus on conceptual or academically minded work more power to them if snag decides it wants to focus its energies another direction thats fine too if youre a snag member and you dont like the direction snag is heading in either work to change the organization or start one of your own ah but i can hear the arguments forming now snags in debt if they narrow their focus and lose membership they will really be in trouble this is where i think metalsmith can take a lesson from american craft instead of creating a publication that exists to serve a very very small community start to examine the ways in which art jewelry metalsmithing are relevant to society as a whole we need art jewelry and conceptual metalsmithing just as we need other forms of art to help us navigate the world as it is and to examine the inconsistencies in our daily lives if snag and metalsmith did a better job of linking the objects we make to the larger world the magazine would be far more compelling perhaps id even take the time to renew my subscription

5830663 the investments came with risk the city prescribed the most meager of controls for its new historic districts there were no comprehensive use guidelines to prevent the area from being overrun with tacky souvenir shops and noisy bars design guidelines didnt regulate interiors old zoning laws often were in conflict with the intent of a historic district the preservation board served only an advisory function there was minimal protection against owners impetuously demolishing a building the code enforcement department seemed to prefer pushing demolition to encouraging renovation most of the national register district was not covered by any local controls the business owners and residents old and young were being pulled along with the flow although city hall had come a long way it was clear that the focus was on the economics not the aesthetics
5830664 spent hours on his boat puking his guts into his helmet
5830665 he advanced like everyone else shivering down to his bones his mouth open his eyes dull with an expression of stupid astonishment like that of certain corpses on their beds
5830666 he was in a state of shock for the rest of his life hardly capable of smiling wounded to the quick at having survived so many friends he saw dying and had to leave behind on june 6 1944 he decided that life is a lie and death is the only truth that day too he decided he would spend the rest of his time in normandy

5830668 the important mission i had assigned myself always the same one to kill my father
5830669 not the least of my regrets is never to have tried to make peace with him
5830670 of a heart attack one fine day when the world smelled like newly mown hay in the emergency room of elbeuf hospital
5830671 ive recounted my story in order to free myself from the grief of never having given my father a chance to talk to me or myself a chance to forgive him i want for nothing only a future and a clear conscience which amounts perhaps to the same thing after having left remorse wherever i took my hatred i have decided to love everyone even my enemies and to live every day every encounter every conversation as though it were my last thats what my fathers death taught me
5830672 was perpetually eaten up by a strange malady part melancholy part social resentment part metaphysical migraine

5830676 one never learns as fast as on a farm everyones truth from humans to worms which is to become the layer of earth that our descendants will step on before they are covered in turn one day or another by another layer and so on to the end of time

5830697 historians looking back will probably say that baby boomers turned greatest generation morality on its head whereas the greatest generation imposed its morality on private behavior and personal relationships the baby boom projected its morality onto our social behavior and public relationships whereas the greatest generation viewed sexual and other personal behavior as a moral or religious issue the baby boom sees it as an individual choice and a private personal issue whereas the greatest generation accepted racial bigotry sex discrimination cultural conformity and environmental degradation as unchanging realities the baby boom deems them unconscionable realities that need to be changed
5830698 this generations accomplishments eclipse what came before it and why the baby boom must be recognized as the greater generation
5830699 keep him in demand as a consultant and commentator on political communications and american culture

5830701 a plateau of liberalism or egalitarianism that characterizes our social norms today
5830702 nowadays we celebrate greatest generation americans for their many virtues
5830703 but we do so with a dash of willful self deception for when they came back from defending freedom and equality and individual rights and human dignity abroad they readily accepted and even promoted assaults on those ideals here at home segregation discrimination inequality blanket conformity and uniformity suppression of dissent devaluing people because they were different

5830712 how could it be that one could feel such heartache and such hope at the same time how was it that something could feel so right and so wrong simultaneously and how could one ever know in these shapeless days of moral codes being so much a matter of personal choice if one was behaving in the way that one ought to be behaving she put the heels of her hands up against her temples and closed her eyes what anyway did ought mean anymore
5830713 we praise children now until they cant take failure of the smallest kind so why cant we praise women for being good at things that arent traditionally female why do women always always have to be the givers and if they stop giving even for a minute why is there this unspoken accusation that they have somehow surrendered on being truly female

5830723 an unmarried old man who having nothing else to do with a competence saved from the practice of medicine thinks he has a story to tell
5830724 is it not something to tell when a score of people whom i knew and loved people beyond whose lives i could imagine no other life either out of violence in themselves or the times or out of some misery or shame scattered into the new life of the modern age where they cannot even find themselves why cannot life change without tangling the lives of innocent persons why do innocent persons cease their innocence and become violent and evil in themselves that such great changes may take place

5830728 my mother explained that my father had mixed blood and his parents were both light skinned creoles from new orleans where race mixing had been common she said that his parents had to pass for white in order to get work in 1930s new york which confused my father about what their family was or was supposed to be
5830729 the one drop rule which classified as black any americans with the tiniest fraction just one drop of black blood it had grown out of a practice dating back to slavery known as hypodescent which assigned someone of mixed parentage to the lower status race and had become the legal and social custom in the era of legalized jim crow segregation
5830730 the broyards had begun to be identified in public records as mulatto or free people of color
5830731 it had been nearly a decade since my father had died since id learned of his and my african ancestry since id begun reading and learning and talking about race and despite my glimmerings of double consciousness i didnt yet feel black i was still waiting for an aha moment an affirmation of this identity down deep in my bones
5830732 the thought of how blinded id been in my obsession to find a slave ancestor made me feel sick with shame
5830733 i hated the image of myself in a black acquaintances eyes a silly white girl making a big fuss over nothing i hated how uncertain i became when trying to locate myself on this racial landscape or even recognize its terrain torn between trying to pinpoint the boundaries between black and white and an urge to deny their existence at all i was caught in a dialectical tug of war the futility of my efforts reminded me of a skit i once saw in which a man kept moving a wooden chair around an empty white room unable to find a spot that suited him despite their being all the same
5830734 my father truly believed that there wasnt any essential difference between blacks and whites and that the only person responsible for who he was supposed to be was himself
5830735 sniped that my dad was black when he entered the subway in brooklyn and white when he got out at west fourth street in manhattan
5830736 was my fathers choice rooted in self preservation or in self hatred did it strike a blow for individualism or for discrimination was he a hero or a cad

5830739 alice was sometimes accused of inconsistency yet much was constant throughout her life books her intellectual curiosity the need to be at the center her conviction that the united states should not become entangled in the business of foreign countries her dismissal of whiners complainers and those who indulged in regrets her belief that what a later generation would call self fulfillment and what she called an appetite for being entertained was just as viable a path as do gooderism her support for conservative national fiscal policy her loyalty to her friends her shyness her loathing of drunkenness her fear of losing control her commitment to independence

5830742 alice roosevelts inability to trust wholeheartedly created a potent and troubling mix when added to the celebrity status that caused her to question the intentions of friends and suitors her ferocious desire to be free of confining rules may have been a test who would love her even when she pushed the furthest boundaries alices teenage years predated the 1920s and the 1960s two eras famous for youth rebellions in the first decade of the twentieth century a womans goal was marriage which required behavior beyond reproach but alice had a special worry she could never trust that any man loved her for herself the more she gave in to her fears and became a female caricature of her fathers most criticized traits impetuosity stubbornness insensitivity the more she alienated some men and perversely the more she also became a hero to others the end result would be a woman who fit no mold the journey to that late life serene self possession was painful all the more so because so much of it occurred in public

5830769 the deep satisfaction there was in doing the work of a parish priest his daily mass meant even more to him at st monicas
5830770 for the life of him father urban couldnt see how the catholic church among large corporations could be rated second only to standard oil in efficiency as time had reported a few years back
5830771 a good part of his working day was spent in wandering back and forth between the lavatory and the job yes he knew what he was a disgruntled employee blowing himself to a bit of company time but he didnt care and he didnt give the boss quite enough cause to complain however it got so that the employee knew what to expect if in his journeys to and from the lavatory he paused too long at a window for a look at the outside world he knew that the boss would soon come along and offer him a cigarette there was no use trying to smoke a cigar if you did the kind of work they did and then a light there theyd be then just a couple of average guys such as they saw in the evening on television taking their well earned break

5830778 i was a married man so she did not anticipate a long term future with me nor i with her
5830779 i failed to screw up my courage sufficiently to tell my wife i wanted to leave her my two small boys sandy and david proved to be the mooring lines that held me and i could not muster the strength to break away

5830782 frances would not agree to an uncontested divorce and in those times obtaining a contested one was a horrific ordeal entailing such unsavoury expedients as having oneself photographed committing adultery in a sleazy motel room
5830783 concluded that the only solution for us was to live together common law
5830784 two people living together without benefit of marriage were pretty generally regarded as being outside the social pale

5830796 when the conference ended churchill went to the airport to see roosevelt off
5830797 the riddle for a biographer is to explain how this hudson river aristocrat a son of privilege who never depended on a paycheck became the champion of the common man the answer most frequently suggested is that the misfortune of polio changed roosevelt
5830798 was too talented to be confined by the circumstances of his birth
5830799 an unspoken dignity an impenetrable reserve that protected him against undue familiarity
5830800 an incredible capacity for making people feel at ease and convincing them their work was important

5830803 there is probably only one bluefin left for every fifty present in 1940
5830804 the last of these regal fish are today pursued more relentlessly than ever the fish are now so valuable that it pays to employ planes and helicopters to scan the ocean guiding boats in for the kill when fish are spotted this isnt fishing any more it is the extermination of a species

5830806 the whole bay yields only 80 000 bushels a year down from a peak of 15 million in the nineteenth century
5830807 there is a common theme in european expansion and exploitation of the sea first the explorers columbus cabot drake bering cook and others set sail for god country fame and wealth they returned with tales of strange seas teeming with wildlife through books the possibilities for exploitation became known in europe stimulating a second wave of travel financed by merchant adventurers in pursuit of profit those voyages although commercially motivated were instrumental in extending the boundaries of the known world as well as the animals slaughtered for commercial ends sailors and travelers had major impacts on the fauna of islands and the sea butchering millions of animals for provisions
5830808 a quarter to a third of all animals caught are simply tossed back into the sea most of them dead or dying
5830809 fishers complained that the trawlers were wiping out fish stocks especially by the destruction of fish spawn and immature fish
5830810 the trawl cleared the bottom and ruined their bait beds
5830811 crab populations were imperiled by soft crabs being crushed when shedding their shells
5830812 the trawl broke up and dispersed schools of fish driving them away
5830813 distant water fleets spread fisheries across the atlantic from pole to pole
5830814 purse seine boats now seed the ocean with veritable forests of floating decoy logs and other fish aggregating devices to bring together scattered shoals of fish when they return they scoop up the fish with ruthless efficiency taking with them turtles sharks and dolphins whatever happens to be there for some reason logs preferentially attract juvenile tuna so their take even of the target species is wasteful by catching young tuna before they reach adulthood purse seiners forgo much higher catches for themselves later and they are also denying these tuna the chance to reproduce putting future catches at risk where once the vast canvas of the sea was great enough for fish to lose themselves in escaping capture today even the high seas afford little refuge new technology has given old fishing methods a far more lethal edge
5830815 we need fifty times more reserve areas to do the job well spread across the waters of coastal nations and the high seas
5830816 perhaps geologists feel saddened by the loss of some remarkable gypsum formation rendered to dust for plasterboard i dont know but i certainly feel anguish on seeing coral glades leveled it hurts to know we are losing species whose forms have never been described and perhaps have never been seen by people they have shared our planet for countless millennia living undisturbed lives deep in the sea extinction the irrevocable loss of a species causes pain that can never find relief it is an ache that will pass from generation to generation for the rest of human history
5830817 the wild leaps of time and space back and forth the varied people and varied things that keep cropping up doubtless seem out of place but that is the way it is i write from a memory of the events that made the firmest impressions upon me more or less in the order of their remembrance rather than the order of their happening as you mature the long exciting days and years of your youth pass before your eyes as in a montage a montage of the events that were important in making the real you the now you the now me is a composer a song writer unimportant as it may be this little book goes on to tell what i was to experience to become that very thing it is my answer to the question another writers will be different

5830821 and all the time i thought of bloomington i remembered the boys i knew the circuses coming to town and the flour sacks we collected from boardinghouses and sold to the local grocer for a cent each remembered the pop stands we built with the money the quarry holes where we used to swim i remember the kindly neighbors who suffered us with never a reproachful word except when we dumped corn silks in their privies or dumped these same little outhouses with a bang on halloween

5830824 in those days and in the days to follow jazz maniacs were being born and i was one of them there were leaping legions of them from new orleans to chicago and bloomington was right in the middle alleged to be in the exact center of population at that time and a part of the population was going jazz crazy

5830833 he loathes cruelty his sympathy for the out of luck man is as intense as his contempt for the pretentious and stupid one he sees that children being closer to the natural world than their elders are have more true wisdom than adults he finds the family life of dogs to be more rational than that of humans and their courage and loyalty generally superior

5830861 you go to touch on human identities to people an empty map you have a notion that this is the worlds heart you go to encounter the protean shapes of faith you go because you are still young and crave excitement the crunch of your boots in the dust you go because you are old and need to understand something before its too late you go to see what will happen

5830864 all at once the future had grown more potent than the past change was rendering things obsolete you could see this where high rise apartment blocks barged into the old suburbs bulldozing the clustered generations of the communal courtyard and banking up tiers of nuclear families in their place
5830865 governor richardson and senator obama spoke backstage before todays event it was a personal conversation and i cant comment on what they discussed
5830866 i believe we have to start with the basic premise that every family in america should be able to get health insurance
5830867 heres the bottom line if you think that this economy is working well if you think george bush has been a good steward of the economy then you should vote for john mccain if on the other hand you think weve got some fundamental decisions to make to rebound america so they can live out their version of the american dream then you need to vote for barack obama for president of the united states
5830868 bill richardson i think has it right which is that weve got to have better border security that means more effective surveillance that means more effective patrols weve got to crack down on employers who are hiring undocumented workers and exploiting them
5830869 having said that what is true is that we do have a general immigration problem with folks coming mostly from the south of the border but not exclusively
5830870 barack obama is out of touch with new mexicos working families and he is out of touch with issues important to hispanics but dont take my word for it many hispanic democrats feel the same way

5830872 the 18th green was under water for two to three months the maintenance building was damaged the place took a beating
5830873 to me the assessments were a reason for some to consider leaving the club
5830874 once that started happening the management had to ask what would make this a viable club
5830875 that didnt go over well this area was not ready for that kind of exclusivity
5830876 its hard to ask somebody to pay that and then the golf course would have been closed for nine months but they would have been paying dues during that time

5830878 in my particular case i was a member for 25 or 26 years and i was getting ready otcbb gtry to retire at the time i left quite a lot of members had resigned with the prospect of retirement at the end of last year i decided i was probably going to be priced out of being a member with declining membership things were going to have to come up because its basically a participation thing every member has to do his part

5830880 90210 redux are going to have to wait a bit longer
5830881 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere
5830882 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5830883 by refusing to send screeners of the 90210 premiere to critics the cw has aroused deep suspicions
5830884 90210 is already generating a zip codes worth of interest thanks in part to the speculation without any reviews the network and studio probably feel as if reviews would only hurt that stream of press and publicity

5830999 james can come through the middle and attack defences he can have a free role when we have the ball but he has to know what we want when we dont have possession
5831000 he has developed his game hes playing regular football he has a good manager in alex mcleish and hes happy and improving
5831001 kenny miller is another who has done well for scotland and he has handled a difficult move back to rangers
5831002 i very much want to see how he and james combine if it works well against northern ireland were looking to keep it going for the opening world cup qualifier against macedonia
5831003 i feel at times that when we get the ball we keep it back and play it square when we could make better use of it
5831004 weve worked at passing the ball through midfield but with a purpose to it its a case of developing play from full backs through the middle to the players up front

5831014 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of
5831015 the court found that the mbta massachusetts bay transportation authority was not likely to prevail on the merits of its claim under the federal computer fraud and abuse act cfaa
5831016 mbta had argued that the cfaa which prohibits the transmission of a program that causes damage to a computer also covers verbal transmission such as talking to people at conferences
5831017 judge george otoole however looked closely at the statute and held that the cfaa does not apply to security researchers like the students talking to people
5831018 the mbta would be far better off focusing on improving the mbtas fare payment security instead of pursuing needless litigation
5831019 to demonstrate to the mit undergrads and their eff counsel that the mbtas goal in this case is simply responsible disclosure and no more
5831020 the restraining order even if modified remains an improper prior restraint restricting speech
5831021 were very pleased that the court recognized that the mbtas legal arguments were meritless
5831022 the mbtas attempts to silence these students were not only misguided but blatantly unconstitutional
5831023 all the negative attacks from the mccain campaign seem to have been paying off
5831024 but the message is sent i vladimir putin and russia can do whatever we want to do and you cant stop us because we have the oil
5831025 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used that will make it that when it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
5831026 for anyone who thought that stark international aggression was a thing of the past the last week must have come as a startling wake up call
5831027 russia no longer shares any of the values and principles of the g 8 so they should be excluded
5831028 russian actions in clear violation of international law have no place in 21st century europe
5831029 this should be unacceptable to all the democratic countries of the world and should draw us together in universal condemnation of russian aggression
5831030 military force will not resolve this dispute the only viable long term solution is international mediation and peacekeeping
5831031 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
5831032 i spent three years on war and i including many other people who spent just as much if not close to the same amount of time will not be credited in the game
5831033 i was told they made sure to not include anyone in the list who was not at the office the day of the credit list creation
5831034 this is wrong on many levels and should not go unnoticed
5831035 any person who has contributed to the production of the game for at least 30 days of a 12 month or greater project
5831036 projects shorter than 12 months any person who has contributed during 10 of the projects total time in development

5831039 im going to have the best boobs in the nursing home
5831040 im going to be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5831041 i never let myself feel defeated like this is the worst day of my life i never gave up on the negotiations
5831042 you have to choose the moments you cannot pound the table all the time or keep threatening to walk out superiors instructions are to stay focused on the negotiations not to get emotional or too excited
5831043 the happiest time was when i got the first five out
5831044 we dont know what to make of these other abductions japanese are usually kidnapped to go teach japanese language and culture to north koreans
5831045 we are dealing with a very strange regime that has dynasty characteristics like passing on power from father to son molded into a communist system which they have transformed into their own ideology a kind of assertion of independence
5831046 we want americans to understand the seriousness of this issue we have to do something about the regime not just to free our hostages most north koreans 20 million are in complete confinement it is like one big concentration camp
5831047 i cant tell you what it feels like inside for a son not to talk to his father so often and by telephone i had such great respect for my father
5831048 i never felt i was the right fit for the private sector i wanted to devote my life to public service
5831049 the real inspiration to join the foreign service came in 1972 when i was a junior in college when a diplomatic breakthrough allowed for the normalization of ties between tokyo and beijing
5831050 it was the unfinished business of world war ii sooner or later like it or not we had to deal with it it was like this refreshing wake up call for men and women of my generation i too felt personally encouraged and charged
5831051 while some homework was done with the restoration of ties with china we needed to continue diplomatic work on other fronts
5831052 insist on being convinced unless they can prove something dont make any deals with them for me this was a painful and frustrating experience you dont make much progress you get used to it for north koreans time is not a concern
5831053 once you run current account deficits you depend on the kindness of strangers
5831054 this might be the beginning of the end of the american empire
5831055 i was so frightened rocks were flipping all around me and i did not know whether to jump off or not it took almost four hours before we pulled into hong kong when i tumbled to the ground people who were there started clapping
5831056 i went into a downward spiral and thought of committing suicide
5831057 we have our prisoners they have prisoners an exchange would be appropriate and i think it will resolve the problem
5831058 the council of ministers decided to ask its foreign minister to recall lebanons ambassador in washington farid abboud immediately due to irresponsible declarations conflicting with the government and its policies
5831059 had no knowledge of and would not claim any responsibility or adopt what has happened and what is happening along the international border
5831060 aabid khan was very much the mr fix it of the group
5831061 he preyed on vulnerable young people and turned them into recruits to his cause using internet chat rooms to lure them in then incite them to fight
5831062 while these men may not have been actively planning acts of terrorism themselves they sought to incite others for terrorist purposes promoting al qaeda ideology and training programmes
5831063 why dont you just call and threaten to cancel so they bump your bill down
5831064 we are a nuclear energy country we use atomic energy for 20 percent of our electricity
5831065 we had wanted them to decide by the g 8 meeting but if the decision is positive we can wait until august they did not refuse but asked for more time
5831066 when ambassadors are sent to washington their governments actually think they will get to meet the american president every week instead they are embraced by people like walt cutler who help them traverse and navigate the maze of official and diplomatic life like pros
5831067 its part of what we do but we like to focus more on the coffee you could have a drink thats totally beautiful with the most amazing design and tastes like garbage
5831068 since the wounded soldiers could not move about freely the prime minister got close to each soldier on their beds to pose for a commemorative photo
5831069 he wanted to know about the progress in my injury and what i was going to do after i recovered
5831070 alcohol disinfection treatment prior to coming into contact with hospital patients to prevent the spread of any communicable diseases
5831071 i really believe it was a team effort i saw an opening and the possibility to run with something to create a momentum but without them in bogota this would all still be theory
5831072 it was an ambitious program i consider myself lucky pastrana had a big belief we could deliver on this everything that needed to happen he realized it
5831073 people dont realize that uribe is the continuation of pastrana
5831074 at this moment what matters is the country not the status
5831075 we also recognize that we have more to do and we will do so both in the remaining weeks of this years congress and next year when we will have expanded democratic majorities in the house and the senate working with president barack obama

5831086 walking in the dark and trying to grab the banister you start out on a project not knowing what you are going to do and you find your way in the dark
5831087 the range of the childrens experience hurt yes but also anger playfulness mischief longing and a fierce will to live

5831101 i know only too well how ones faith can be challenged having lost a much beloved great uncle lord mountbatten in an i r a terrorist bomb in 1979
5831102 but i remember how it gradually dawned on me that thoughts of vengeance and hatred would merely prolong the terrible law of cause and effect and continue an unbroken cycle of violence
5831103 an eye for an eye and soon the whole world is blind
5831104 the daily violence of words and actions spreads like a fever across cultures and borders yet academic and international dialogues seem too often to focus on mere symptoms and not the infection we need to change the tone and look for ways to harmonize and integrate cross cultural discussions
5831105 bridge divides and overcome prejudice misconceptions misperceptions and polarization which potentially threaten world peace
5831106 margarita on the rocks with salt or super ice cold beer no glass
5831107 people should be judged by character and accomplishments not ethnicity
5831108 pride in us should not curdle into a hatred of them
5831109 the bridge has been rebuilt but the city is still dead
5831110 the idea of doing something bigger than yourself is something you grew up with in my family in those times
5831111 when i was at home recovering the solitary experience gave me a chance to be introspective
5831112 one of the things this taught me was to keep moving despite the challenges
5831113 pediatrics and health care seemed like a concrete way to do that
5831114 how do you heal a population rather than just individual patients
5831115 the education gap between native german children and immigrant children is widening
5831116 the most interesting issue is that the gap is getting bigger not smaller
5831117 to make it out of elementary school to middle and high school something has to happen for some students such as crash language training courses
5831118 we have to change our school system otherwise there will be social problems down the road
5831119 we need this data to develop effective policies and make concrete recommendations
5831120 people are often misinformed and we have to think in terms of facts and feelings we have initiated a media prize for public television channels that feature programs on diversity if you only address problems you will miss the opportunity
5831121 trauma can be a threat but also a great opportunity

5831128 the scar remains in the mind of muslims although america and the west intervened later to rectify it
5831129 and equally september 11 will always be associated with 15 saudis being the murderers the scar will always be with us even though we are trying our best to rectify that there is no quid pro quo in these affairs
5831130 israel cannot countenance a nuclear iran it crosses even the dovish fringe of the israeli spectrum
5831131 maybe the depth of his unpopularity will be a spur for him to listen
5831132 support for israeli deterrence against the iranian nuclear threat can be put in the context of getting out at long long last from palestinian land which could be defined as a key american interest
5831133 we insist that this is only one chapter that is closed it is not the end of it
5831134 ch vez will try to buy the conscience of the people with fertilizer oil and direct money and the electoral council is asking venezuela to supervise the elections sidelining the organization of american states which will come as observer
5831135 we are looking forward to having the diplomatic corps participate in this annual tradition once again it is a wonderful opportunity for friendly international exchange in a casual sportsman like setting
5831136 they mainly wanted to know about the legal reforms in libya that would protect american investors and what kinds of products libyan firms and interests were looking for in u s markets
5831137 the claim that paul rusesabagina having saved so many made him seem like a hero paul rusesabagina did not save people he had no means to do it and he did not do it
5831138 resources that are being mobilized from developed countries should be targeted comprehensively to all other areas of the economy such as poverty and malnutrition
5831139 can you imagine a patient feeding on drugs and dying of hunger or something else a body cannot take in medications without food
5831140 dont isolate hiv aids as a problem and separate it from other health issues such as deficient health infrastructure
5831141 the u s is by far the biggest donor to sudan last year more than 80 percent of all food came from the united states
5831142 live from the 610 kvnu studios at the radio ranch its for the people your daily dose of perspective on local state national and world issues
5831143 clock out of work an hour early and clock into the for the people chat at kvnuforthepeople com
5831144 taking five days to finish a four day work week kvnus for the people
5831145 what can i say im the luckiest girl in the world
5831146 shes officially off the market no one else gets her and now shell cook and clean for me
5831147 it is a comprehensive security program to protect the lower manhattan area indeed all of manhattan from vehicle born explosive devices
5831148 this is more like being under communist reign instead of being in a free country and being able to choose where you want to go when you want to go and not be monitored at all times
5831149 i mean if you dont have anything to worry about you wont worry
5831150 now if youre trying to hide something and they scan your license plate you have a problem then theres good reason
5831151 theres always going to be a spore on a grassy knoll
5831152 it wasnt until late 2005 that the genetics caught up with the investigation
5831153 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5831154 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5831155 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5831156 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5831157 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5831158 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5831159 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5831160 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5831161 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5831162 the insurance superintendent shall promulgate such laws and regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of the new mexico title insurance law including rules and regulations requiring uniform forms of policies and uniform premiums
5831163 our struggle for the environment is not about trees it is a campaign for social justice and respect for human rights
5831164 it is about our right to have a healthy and safe environment
5831165 entire villages were being broken decimated by the timber companies farmers cash crops were being destroyed people were being arrested and detained illegally there were massacres and rapes
5831166 what they were doing to the population was devastating and most of it was being done by chinese companies
5831167 theres a good deal of interest in merchandise that has the local logo not just the national conventions logo
5831168 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat
5831169 ive worked hard my whole life and did what i had to what i could to survive i didnt want to talk about it for a while because i didnt want people to gossip about it i didnt want people to make it out to be worse than it was
5831170 i felt africa was a problem for africans to solve
5831171 if we all run away who will do it thats my strategy
5831172 this is a woman who was in the right place at the right time to make a critical difference for the new nigeria
5831173 you have a head on your shoulders and you have a brain use it even if you lost everything you can start again
5831174 we started to publish figures in a bulletin inserted in newspapers such as the revenue from oil how much went to local government for what and people began to ask questions why is there no chalk why are there potholes in our roads
5831175 it unleashed a whole conversation on how much resources states and local government were allocated and how they used them
5831176 you are tearing the place upside down the country would be better off without you
5831177 it was hurtful but not daunting they thought that by attacking me i would leave
5831178 i was given the opportunity to study and have a professional career in the united states i acquired a lot of skills i worked at these big pharmaceutical companies i worked in programs for the u s army and navy
5831179 i learned how to manage people i have to do this
5831180 every time i went i saw things go from bad to worse
5831181 and people kept asking me to come back and help we tried to be useful but the social situation was dramatic
5831182 and the population feels neglected out of every 100 sent to the congo only 1 7 percent goes to public health
5831183 that is just a tiny drop patients are prisoners in the hospitals of the congo they cannot pay their bills so they are kept hostage
5831184 when i saw all this i knew i must get involved
5831185 i have just spent 40 days sleeping at mass general to be close to my son i felt blessed he is getting the best possible care the brightest doctors the best icu installations
5831186 but i have thousands and thousands of sons in congo who have nothing i made a conscious decision to go back to leave behind the 20 years it took me to build a comfortable life and do what has to be done
5831187 you have to go through all this to understand the suffering of others
5831188 the human price of the war has been of catastrophic proportions i will be playing a role and she will be playing a role
5831189 we must develop a viable congo and build in it in a sustainable way congo is the third richest country on earth with all its natural resources yet there is an unemployment rate of 85 percent
5831190 we shouldnt we take much better care of them here
5831191 oh yes but besides if the marbles stay here so many more people will see them
5831192 we have signed an agreement the chinese have asked for pointers on how my country prepared for the 2004 olympic games i have been there several times and i have even chosen the space where the artifacts will be displayed
5831193 we love american tourists too and we would like to have more of them come
5831194 international issues are national and so many local issues migration communicable diseases organized crime end up touching everyone at the same time there is such suspicion it is quite a paradox
5831195 bilateral diplomacy is more solid multilateral diplomacy is more fluid and diverse
5831196 i have a masochistic pleasure to put in 14 hour days
5831197 every country must agree to have its own human rights record reviewed every three years
5831198 the general assembly can now suspend membership of any country on the council if it commits serious human rights violations this is the first time we have had a suspension clause as a result countries like sudan and zimbabwe are not applying
5831199 we abandoned the insistence on having a two thirds majority vote to bring members in to having an absolute majority of 96 votes for membership it is a compromise but not a compromise of principles
5831200 we cannot lose the human rights pillar which i call the soul of the u n and the vote was a resounding confirmation for that
5831201 some type of international system an international regime with safeguards for the manufacture and supply of enriched uranium
5831202 it can take a long time to develop and set up but we need to think of energy
5831203 there should be an international place to go for power purposes that will be able to provide resources and take resources back for all the countries down the road
5831204 they think it makes sense that is really the way to go
5831205 my worry is the revival of the north s outh divide
5831206 but it squeezes us out of the process for now
5831207 reform is not about stripping the g a of power
5831208 we can pursue reform goals without rearranging the furniture of power at the u
5831209 as a manager i feel the frustration of having a very limited degree of authority
5831210 we have to find a way of involving g a members to help find a way to do our management job better
5831211 more flexibility and holding us more accountable with more oversight boards in other words judge us by the results focus on that without getting distracted by issues of power and turf
5831212 we must reform not because the united nations has failed but because it has succeeded enough to be worth investing in
5831213 as a legal scholar i can tell you this law contradicts our constitution irans sixth parliament approved a vote to change this law but the council of guardians rejected the demand
5831214 democracy is not an incident that happens overnight nor a gift that america can give to the world
5831215 i always knew i wanted to write about the widows of india
5831216 it is about a war between tradition and the desire for an independent voice
5831217 earth was about the politics of sectarian wars and water is about the politics of religion as it affects women
5831218 here you are trying to deal with your pain looking for some dignity in the life left for you as a widow and you are shunned
5831219 water is flowing it is about life and we are part of it
5831220 it is about purity and cleansing yet it can be stagnant
5831221 it is a true hindu question but it applies to any religion
5831222 when it is not questioned it stagnates what needs to be done to keep the religion alive these words truth is god are as powerful for hindus as they are for muslims or catholics
5831223 rejecting the other everything and everyone that is not familiar is when tradition lets insecurity be perpetuated
5831224 i dont come from that place and it is not just about indian women it is not a message it is a response it is the most loving film i have done it came from a place of real calmness of caring about the journey of the characters
5831225 a bit of my aunt my grandmother me in another
5831226 instead of caring for a widow they may keep what money they may have to spend on her
5831227 because of my experience i began to question as a catholic church leader the perceived notions
5831228 i dont undermine the veracity of abstinence before marriage and loyalty among couples but what about the vulnerable women who dont have that option what about realizing that the official church in circumstances of human living does not respond to that reality
5831229 it is more of a justice and ethical issue the right to life the protection and dignity of life a pro life stand from conception to death
5831230 this is a very difficult and delicate subject that requires prudency
5831231 you should come up with a position which makes sense and which is in sync with the values we espouse a nonjudgmental god and the infinite worth of a human being
5831232 moral injunctions do not help people i think all this calls for a rethink and the acceptance of an authentic pro life stance the issue becomes how do you protect life in this pandemic
5831233 once it is possible in a moral principle to make room to save lives
5831234 my position extends to women and girl children who are subject to all kinds of abuse
5831235 abstinence is fine as an ideal but it does not work in all circumstances
5831236 we have to try a more holistic approach a theology and possibility for people to encounter god right within their situation
5831237 if i had known what we were to see i would never have taken those parents with me we just broke down and cried i was expecting a black patch of land the soldiers were not cremated just incinerated
5831238 when your child or your husband is missing anxiety increases when death is certain you know you grieve as time passes and you are still wondering you cannot move on your family is paralyzed and it can never be the same
5831239 if you dont join me today the child holding your hand may be lost to you forever
5831240 parents of the fighters the liberation tigers of tamil eelam were sympathetic
5831241 we want our dignity if you cant let us be human beings then keep us separate
5831242 it is unfortunate that this happened to me but i want to open the eyes of many others to issues that are not taken seriously
5831243 i have met mothers from chile russia and kosovo i am just a mother with no agenda frankly i am a victim but i have also learned how to assume leadership
5831244 obviously we are very sensitive to the disaster that happened and the need for absolute transparency
5831245 every entry judged will have individual judges comments and we will include on the back of each award who the judge was
5831246 i have commuted his sentence and i am asking the kurdistan national assembly to review laws on press freedom and to consider changes that will make our press and writers more free not less
5831247 he told me he was in good health just fine and that he is expected to arrive in austria early friday
5831248 he told ambassador harrer by telephone that after he returns to austria he would like to come back to iraqs kurdish region at some point in the future
5831249 sue sue is really cute right now and weighs about 43 44 pounds
5831250 there have been a number of zoos and individuals who have adopted pandas who will never come to the united states
5831251 we would just love to have more pandas and we have also been collaborating with the chinese for the past eight years on the preservation of south china tigers
5831252 noyes has threatened to kill me and my family and will not rest until we are dead all the evidence you need is in his computer and that little girls mind please save her
5831253 extreme punishments such as locking her in a closet with no food for three days
5831254 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
5831255 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
5831256 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
5831257 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
5831258 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
5831259 i have a huge inventory of machines that i am not able to use
5831260 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit
5831261 the fact is if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
5831262 you cant throw them away they could be uncle freddys ashes they could come and sue you
5831263 there needs to be a dignified way to finally put these people to rest and allow the funeral homes to do that under the law
5831264 youll hear people say all the time just cremate me and throw me in the river
5831265 the more the word gets out that cremation is not final disposition that something still needs to be done the better off we will be
5831266 evolutionary science is as much about the posturing salesmanship stonewalling and bullying as it is about actual scientific theory

5831270 im sure those people will say ok i have to do the liberty bell independence hall cheesesteaks the rocky statue and the comcast screen
5831271 its just amazing how many people come flocking to this thing with smiles on their faces
5831272 to capture the 20 second audience in transit and get a smile on their face is unbelievably rewarding
5831273 we went for this because we wanted to create something that would be very high technology in our building that would communicate the high technology business that were in
5831274 when you go into lots of media companies very often you see televisions in their lobbies big screens with network content on it we thought that we wanted to do something more sophisticated than that
5831275 and now there are thousands of people coming in to see the wall shop to visit the cafe fountain or just hang around
5831276 theres a certain thing that people would expect to see up on a screen like that
5831277 and weve gone to great lengths to create the unexpected

5831282 the intellectual focus of the institute would reflect the traditions of the chicago school and typify some of milton friedmans most interesting academic work

5831284 producers in a free market will never produce enough of an item for everybody because if they did there would cease to be a market for it
5831285 producers in a free market will never produce enough of an item for everybody because if they did there would cease to be a market for it this is why a true free market doesnt work and never has
5831286 the sacrificial reduction of social values to monetary calculations is the essence of friedman economics and helps explain its historic taint as the complement of state terror
5831287 fwiw which isnt much i guess i think theer are reasonable objections to the mfi based on what seems to be a clear ideological predisposition
5831288 producers in a free market will never produce enough of an item for everybody because if they did there would cease to be a market for it this is why a true free market doesnt work and never has
5831289 using actual capital to dictate research is stupid and you know it
5831290 why on earth would an accountant get a hundred dollar note tattooed on his privates
5831291 well one i like to watch my money grow two once in a while i like
5831292 the high courts june 2007 decision written by justice anthony kennedy declared that minimum pricing pacts between manufacturers and retailers could benefit customers under certain circumstances for instance the pacts could foster competition by giving retailers enough profit to promote a brand or offer better service justice kennedy wrote
5831293 what the hell are you doing with all these penguins
5831294 no way you take those penguins to the zoo right now
5831295 hey i thought i told you to take these penguins to the zoo
5831296 i did we had a great time today im taking them to the beach

5831298 why why was she feeling like sophia loren she looks nothing like sophia loren
5831299 its the uncertainty about the size of their write downs theres a lot more to come its affecting the entire fixed income market and lehman is at the top of everyones list

5831301 he took out all these large bills and placed them on the bed and said dont touch i was instructed to take my clothes off everything no foreplay so i got on the bed and he just stood at the edge of the mattress and stared he told me that all the money was going to be mine by the end of the night they were all hundreds maybe 50 of them once i got naked he got on the bed and unzipped his pants and told me to start playing with myself i kind of just laid there and faked an orgasm he started jerking off and he shot all over the money
5831302 so then he grabs all of it in a bundle and throws it at me

5831368 750 watts may not be totally future proof but considering there is currently only one setup to date that pushes above 750 watts and consumers are trying to make manufacturers provide lower power components that are
5831369 i have always been a fan of amd in fact it was on an amd that i popped my overclocking cherry looking back over the years its always great to see the die hard fans of intel and amd duke it out over cpu supremacy however for the last couple of years intel has had the speed crown thanks to the c2d and c2q nevertheless amd had held the speed crown for several years before that and i dont think they were happy losing it amd is not going to settle for second best in a two man race the 9950 black edition is their new flagship and were going to take it for a test drive to see whats its made of
5831370 thermaltake may have the largest selection of cases available right now they have been the type of company to not rest or settle with their current collection of cases in their catalog this is great for the builder that wants to be able to select from a long list of cases without seeing a repeat of the same case what i mean is some companies take one case and keep recycling the same design over and over all this being external yes thermaltake will make one case and make it in a small and a larger size nothing wrong with that
5831371 i was very impressed with the ep45t ds3r i have always been leery of power saving features as most just sap performance from your system in the name of saving you power heat and noise whatever this did not seem to be the case with the ades system on the ep45t ds3r even while overclocked the system ran well and did not seem to hinder my overclock at all
5831372 as long as its matched it depends on how granular you want to be e g treat x86 vs x64 devices differently
5831373 technology doesnt play favorites and when it reaches an apex there is an indifference towards who develops it
5831374 the other day we looked at the gtx 260 from gigabyte today were going to be looking at the slightly more expensive gtx 280 version from them since launch we havent really seen any companies do much with the gtx 280 while a few have come overclocked we have found that theyve all stuck to the reference cooling option today were going to be looking at the gtx 280 from gigabyte which follows the reference design down to a tee the good news is that the price is also extremely competitive and for the most part the overclocks a lot of companies offer can be achieved by using a program like rivatuner on your stock card

5831383 we created the n4100pro with speed and total security in mind
5831384 with new features increased reliability and enhanced performance users will discover that the n4100pro is a more than worthy successor for the four bay n4100 that started it all

5831402 im a total believer and it may be because here in delaware these health centers work extremely well
5831403 most people have a notion that elderly people have very weak immunity or they have lost immunity
5831404 this study shows that extremely elderly people have retained memory of being infected with the 1918 flu even 90 years later
5831405 its important to know that you can develop immunity to such a pandemic virus that has implications for new pandemic viruses
5831406 the elderly might be a very good donor source for finding antibodies against viruses
5831407 this study shows that humans can develop very potent immune responses against dangerous influenza that cause pandemics
5831408 it gives us hope that we can develop vaccines and antibody treatments for any other pandemic viruses that come along
5831409 the implication of this study is the 1918 virus was so powerful that the immunity you had to have in order to survive was so prominent that it lasted for the rest of your life
5831410 so those in certain age groups who had seen a related virus had the strongest responses
5831411 either they died or they developed a profound immune response
5831412 as a result of these findings we are in the process of developing a cardiac fitness index to be released later this year that will help trainers and coaches understand how cardiac conditions impact performance of high endurance athletes
5831413 our work also will provide healthcare professionals with insight into new more effective ways of assessing and treating heart disease for the general public
5831414 i fully support the action to have preparticipation cardiovascular screening mandatory for elite athletes this will evaluate athletes before participating in sports for the purpose of identifying or raising suspicion of abnormalities that could provoke disease progression or sudden cardiac death ensuring the well being of all athletes is the iocs priority and we feel that the identification of the relevant diseases will allow clinicians to make decisions earlier on of whether a player can stay in the game or not but above all tailor their training programs to best meet their needs and ensure athlete safety
5831415 we were surprised to find that athletes who trained at the highest level with no sign of pain showed early signs of potential injury during routine scanning
5831416 weve found that ultrasound technology can highlight problems with structure and with mobility of tissues that no other examination technique can show
5831417 we train so hard as athletes that little injuries can lead to further injuries
5831418 through these routine scans we can know if we should sit out but if we know that we can keep going we can train at the highest level
5831419 if we can move toward predictive healthcare and early detection of disease we have the potential to dramatically reduce the risks of late stage disease treatment
5831420 shifting resources to develop technologies that allow healthcare providers to diagnose disease at the earliest possible stage when there can be many treatment options is better medicine
5831421 net effect of the new regime of global interactions is a reduction in global inequality
5831422 the reason why many poor small countries are hardly represented in negotiations that concern them directly is that they cannot afford the cost of hotels offices and salaries in places like washington dc and geneva which must be paid not in ppp dollars but in hard currency bought with their own currency at market exchange rates
5831423 the richest 2 of adults in the world own more than half of all household wealth while the poorer half of the worlds population own barely 1 of global wealth
5831424 even if the poor were to get just a little richer this would not necessarily imply that the poor were getting a fair share of the potentially vast benefits of global economic interrelations it is not adequate to ask whether international inequality is getting marginally larger or smaller in order to rebel against the appalling poverty and the staggering inequalities that characterize the contemporary world or to protest against the unfair sharing of benefits of global cooperation it is not necessary to show that the massive inequality or distributional unfairness is also getting marginally larger this is a separate issue altogether
5831425 income inequality in the global economy the myth of rising world inequality
5831426 it is the second biggest economy in the world and in 50 years it will be the biggest
5831427 starting with diefenbaker trudeau and all of us we established very good relations relatively speaking with china and suddenly you break the bridge it would have been easy just to be there
5831428 will be the final leg of the political race this year
5831429 putting my general managers hat back on considering where the network is right now it is actually the right call

5831438 then celtic came in and wanted to do the deal quickly which i liked i spoke with jan vennegoor of hesselink and the former celtic striker pierre van hooijdonk an old team mate of mine at feyenoord and they advised me to come here
5831439 the champions league was an attraction but it wasnt the only thing i want to win medals and celtic have won the last three championships in scotland
5831440 he said that to me but that was because he was trying to persuade me to stay with them
5831441 of course hes entitled to his opinion but its mine that counts i played international football up to under 21 level with robin van persie wesley schneider and johnny heitinga and i believe that playing here can get me into the dutch squad
5831442 if you can imagine a cross between carlos cuellar and jean alain boumsong then thats how good he is he has a mixture of their qualities with a bit of former rangers defender sotirios kyrgiakos thrown in

5831445 over the inland revenue departments decision not to honour formal written gst agreements it signed with the industry in 2001 and instead seek 30 million of back taxes
5831446 appalled by the conduct of the ird towards our industry
5831447 the ird has behaved incompetently arbitrarily and retrospectively it is out of control
5831448 during the party they picked a lock into the homeowners office got into his briefcase took some cash and some jewelry and then got into the locked gun cabinet and stole a browning 9mm handgun and several boxes of ammunition and two knives

5831452 we probably will see the canadian economy continue to struggle in the coming quarters
5831453 it wont be until early 2009 that we finally start to see signs that it is regaining some momentum
5831454 real gdp in june is probably up about 0 2 per cent
5831455 that economic growth in the second quarter is going to come in at about 0 8 per cent
5831456 when the economy is healthy its growing at around 2 8 per cent
5831457 weve been seeing moderation on the housing front as consumer spending is coming down after an unsustainable rate of growth in prior quarters
5831458 no question they were good in june but what its really doing is its helping to keep the economys head above water but only just
5831459 it is something we are going to have to watch
5831460 if its something that is not growing we are going to have to revisit endeavor its comparatively safer than the other stents and thats good
5831461 if im not mistaken there was an improvement on quality of life from stents if not a survival benefit at a certain price point that is worth doing
5831462 we have never seen a gap between the leader and the rest of the pack this big
5831463 if i challenge any of you to beer pong i just might have you beat
5831464 we should see 50 million people reached by wimax by the end of this year
5831465 obviously we are very sensitive to the disaster that happened and the need for absolute transparency
5831466 every entry judged will have individual judges comments and we will include on the back of each award who the judge was
5831467 the mystics have not moved one ounce in their 11 year history and weve got to start making some changes it is the only way this team is going to survive
5831468 if i cant move the marker here im going to lose my fan base im going to lose my corporate support and i just might as well shut down and i dont want to do that i want to make a difference in this team i want a winning team
5831469 our issue has not been lack of effort it has been lack of talent
5831470 this is pro basketball and good coaching and gutty performances can only take a team so far the mystics need athletes and we need scorers and we need a roster of young ladies whose collective physical skills make other teams in the league dread the thought of playing us
5831471 the mystics have been operating for too long without a long term plan
5831472 in the three years that i have been an owner and a general partner our thinking has been far too shortsighted and our player personnel decisions are far too needs based that all ends today
5831473 shes done a wonderful job and she knows what our new mission is
5831474 and just like everybody else shes going to be held to a higher standard
5831475 i just wanted to come out and make a statement that im back and let my teammates know
5831476 i havent played well since the first two games and ive been down on myself not contributing as much as id like
5831477 its hard to remember that she missed six weeks with that knee injury
5831478 that was our goal to go inside and get them in early foul trouble
5831479 when you look across the planet things are different depending on where youre talking about
5831480 we didnt see much of a change in the third quarter from the second quarter
5831481 this time the company got a little help from the weak dollar
5831482 the company had strong tailwinds in europe and the asia pacific region
5831483 impressive in light of concerns that a stronger u s dollar would be negative for its international business
5831484 the company remains well positioned long term given they its leadership in pc notebooks and emerging markets
5831485 were sad to say the video recording we did at the baltic sea festival main stage was fucked up the footage was really great and
5831486 weve tried to work with it but the only was would have been to use the footage and re record the music well i know some bands do that but we wont we will use the footage to make some clip videos for some of the album tracks and post on youtube but the vision of a great live dvd is for the moment put on ice
5831487 we are proud to see hpu included in americas best colleges
5831488 to be listed so high on such a list means we are making tremendous strides to become a selective institution with extraordinary standards we truly do offer a holistic education in a fun and caring environment and people everywhere are taking notice
5831489 it was a mixed bag i know we can play better than that but you can never underestimate winning
5831490 i did not get everything i was looking for but we will go away and have a look at it and it will stand us in good stead ahead of the portugal game

5831495 i know iaff members in the united states and canada have been working harder than ever this year
5831496 i am looking forward to seeing this years totals and hearing about what great things we can do for children diagnosed with muscular dystrophy
5831497 we need academic freedom and an ability to talk about these things without fearing legal consequences
5831498 the marketplace of ideas does not work when we have gag orders imposed on our scientists
5831499 this is a clear indication of the confidence in the quality and value of our cars and trucks
5831500 the mbta ultimately is trying to silence some uncomfortable truths that these students uncovered
5831501 they brought an action against three college kids rather than address the problems in their own house
5831502 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
5831503 this settlement was reached without any admission of liability on behalf of the city and the individual defendants
5831504 although defendants believe that they would ultimately have prevailed at a trial the costs of going forward weighed in favor of a settlement at this time
5831505 im not saying that anyone would be forced to do anything because im a federalist and believe in the rights of states but at the same time theres already been discussion amongst the states and i believe that more discussion amongst the governors is probably something that everybody wants us to do
5831506 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue
5831507 the sole multilateral environmental agreement on land and soil degradation
5831508 a platform to address the important issue of climate change and soil
5831509 we used to have this season from october to april where we had a chance for a storm
5831510 when you pull the storm track north it takes the storms with it
5831511 during the period its raining less it also tends to be warmer than it used to be
5831512 were starting to see the impacts of climate change in the late winter and early spring particularly in the southwest its a season specific kind of drought
5831513 were used to thinking about climate change as happening sometime in the future to someone else but this is right here and affects us now the future is here
5831514 its very rare that you get this distribution by chance
5831515 this just wasnt the elimination of a threat to iraq this was elimination of a threat to the west part of this titanic struggle we are in between western judeo christian values and principles and islamic extremists
5831516 the number one issue people should make in the selection of the president of the united states is will this person carry on in the judeo christian principled tradition that has made this nation the greatest experiment in the history of mankind
5831517 this just wasnt the elimination of a threat to iraq this was elimination of a threat to the west part of this titanic struggle we are in between western judeo christian values and principles and islamic extremists

5831525 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
5831526 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
5831527 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
5831528 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
5831529 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
5831530 well were sure happy for all the work you are doing
5831531 we welcome ea into our formal process and look forward to demonstrating to their board the significant strides made by take two since they last undertook a detailed review of our business in early 2007
5831532 our board remains unwavering in its belief that eas unsolicited conditional tender offer of 25 74 per share was inadequate and undervalued world class entertainment franchises and our strong operational and financial performance
5831533 we are continuing to consider all alternatives that will maximize value to our stockholders
5831534 in the meantime we remain focused on executing on our business goals and creating value for stockholders and consumers of our products
5831535 i like to help people but im here to follow my dreams
5831536 you and covergirl can count on her walking out of the elimination room tail between her legs im sorry i couldnt resist sometime mid season
5831537 initial tests have shown that network load could be reduced by a factor of five or more without compromising network performance
5831538 at the same time speeds are increased by about 20 percent
5831539 we think we have one of the most extensible rigorous architectures for making these applications run more efficiently
5831540 the project seems to have a momentum of its own
5831541 we realized that p2p networks were not taking advantage of the flexibility that exists

5831544 pardon me waiter there appears to be a 9 foot tapeworm in my salmon salad

5831561 listed on the roadmap to gnome 2 24 is the integration with empathy a multi protocol im client
5831562 although ive said it before this next part bears repeating the inclusion of empathy and telepathy into gnome is huge why rotate desktop backgrounds in ubuntu
5831563 lets take a look at how any gnome based linux user can use rotating backgrounds to keep better track of time keep your desktop looking
5831564 there are already several topics the community has requested including how to package python and php apps how to maintain a package and lightweight gnome alternative emerges
5831565 a fast fast booting implementation of gnome aimed at netbooks and older hardware has emerged and shows
5831566 apple and microsoft are both in a situation where they are essentially forced due to past mistakes or a lack of foresight to spend a what do you use to run windows applications on your linux deskto
5831567 xfe is small very fast and only requires the fox library to be fully functional
5831568 wir k nnen nicht so weiter machen als w re nichts passiert
5831569 solange die russischen truppen georgien praktisch besetzt halten kann ich nicht sehen wie wir den nato russland rat einberufen k nnen
5831570 das kann wirklich eskalieren was wir derzeit erleben ist mehr als ein kalter krieg der ist schon hei
5831571 reich an ressourcen und milit risch wieder erstarkt will russland auch wieder eine rolle auf dem parkett der superm chte spielen
5831572 aber auch die russen sind auf gute beziehungen zum westen angewiesen
5831573 das ist unrealistisch russland hat l ngst nicht mehr das milit rische potenzial wie noch zu zeiten der sowjetunion was wir derzeit erleben ist aber eine bedeutende z sur
5831574 russland muss sich endlich entscheiden ob es von seinen nachbarn gef rchtet werden will oder ein seri ser partner sein will der schl ssel liegt in moskau
5831575 the wichita lineman does imbue already good tracks like tom pettys
5831576 ive gone back to my roots and come on over to country music
5831577 i just couldnt be more thrilled for come on over to be a part of this amazing night of country music
5831578 whats the emotional truth to this topic were writing about what are you trying to really say
5831579 my sister lives in the salt lake city area and the beer there is the same as it
5831580 crossover completely opened my eyes to the future of documentary
5831581 the most stimulating brilliantly workshop i have attended it has the capacity to change entire businesses as well as creatives such as myself
5831582 i think there are better ways to help our local citizens reduce the growth of property taxes
5831583 if the governor is trying to raise local property taxes this certainly would be the way to do it
5831584 we agree that there is a problem with the growth of local government but they the grants are tax relief for homeowners
5831585 we need to keep his grant intact so that georgias homeowners are not affected any further in this current economy
5831586 the stories of that period always seemed to follow the same pattern
5831587 how the bright young man arrived in the city fresh from law school where he was put to work immediately on business of utmost urgency how he went for days without sleep
5831588 at this point no one is taking responsibility for which law is holding him there
5831589 now i understand that theres a florida law on fugitives that allows them to give no bond and the florida judge said he wont give bond unless the prosecutor here in arizona says its ok which is not happening
5831590 he will sit in jail until he adjudicates the charges there in miami and then well pick him up
5831591 but now its been more constructed its just going to be called j o n a s and is going to be us dealing with trying to take out the trash and not get hounded by fans its going to be a funny show
5831592 i am very anxious with seven children on land and seven in the sea
5831593 sizeable advertising budgets by the top banks have generated awareness of the service but mobile bankings duplication of online banking functionality is failing to drive significant adoption
5831594 why online bankers and bill payers dont see their transactions as urgent enough to warrant mobile access
5831595 instead they prefer to wait until they can access the web atm or phone channel
5831596 banks have been wooing mobile customers with the promise of banking anytime anytime a message largely falling on deaf ears
5831597 in fact among all online users there is little interest and no appreciable differences among segments
5831598 the functionality on the mobile channel is not sufficiently better or faster to create either preference or urgency
5831599 while customers raise security as a concern with nearly any electronic banking service recent high profile data losses and concerns about carriers role in securing their data have them doubly worried about the state of security in the mobile channel
5831600 here we are almost 10 years later and forrester is getting a bad sense of d j vu
5831601 will banks again be forced to shutter their mobile platforms due to a lack of interest
5831602 forrester believes that this phase of mobile banking will be considered a success when the industry reaches an adoption level of at least 20 percent of online consumers using mobile banking
5831603 unfortunately we dont see that happening before year end 2011 why thats when we expect to see mobile commerce and mobile payments begin to have a significant impact on the adoption of mobile banking
5831604 banks that want to succeed in the mobile channel will be forced to take a long term view that means having significant patience and management support to endure several more years of single digit growth in this emerging channel

5831608 never is so much written and said about so many based on so little first hand knowledge thousands of words are written about players who represent the future of the franchises yet those doing the writing and during the ranking of winners and losers are seeing most draftees for the first time at the draft in their street clothes

5831636 if you brought drinking out into the open and made it legal you can have a conversation with these young adults about drinking more responsibly and about not binge drinking about drinking moderately in a social way in a way thats not going to endanger their health and safety
5831637 were concerned when leaders of colleges where this is obviously a difficult issue when they seem to be raising a white flag and saying we give up that certainly gives us pause and is concerning to us
5831638 i think when youre 18 youre a grown man youre an adult and you can go to war for your country but you cant have a beer
5831639 young people do dumb things enough as it is they dont need to be drinking at that young of an age doing dumber things theyre already very irresponsible
5831640 what we hope is to see a real concentrated effort on addressing that problem we dont see lowering the drinking age as a solution to this problem

5831672 i have no sympathy for breeders or for brie eaters
5831673 the fact that you make a good salary but whine that a certain job didnt take proper account of your questionable intellect and talent only speaks to your solipsistic sic ennui brought on no doubt by your liberal sense of entitlement
5831674 hey self righteous moron commenters who think youre so much smarter and have such better judgment than heather ryan im just waiting for the day when your comfortable safe job vanishes your spouse comes down with a debilitating illness and your parents suddenly need round the clock care it can happen to anyone even the people who pride themselves on how much more sensible their choices are than the rest of ours im guessing you think you can stave off the badness by picking on others who chose differently youd be wrong about that

5831677 the hunter 140 is a fabulous family day sailer the wide beam keeps it stable and dry while its planing hull allows it to really move parents will appreciate the unsinkability and ease of sailing for children and they will love the ability to really perform for themselves the hull is built with an advanced composite process which integrates an abs plastic high density foam and woven roving into a sandwich construction that is both unsinkable and five times more impact resistant than fiberglass rigging the 140 is quick and easy with a deck stepped hinged mast a large main and small jib provides plenty of power but is also easy to handle an uncluttered cockpit and wide bench seats can accommodate all the crew

5831684 the olympic games serve as an apt metaphor and occur at an appropriate time to remind the nations educators and parents that we need to acknowledge this widespread problem and work harder to engage boys in reading
5831685 boys have trouble reading because they dont get to read for a purpose that makes any sense to them
5831686 as a society we need to make more of an effort to connect boys with many different kinds of reading both at home and at school
5831687 if we can expand the notion of what reading is well have a better chance of inspiring boys to want to be readers this means broadening our definition of reading to include boy friendly nonfiction humor sports comics graphic novels action adventure magazines websites and newspapers boys need to know that these materials count as reading
5831688 we can help boys become readers by giving them a reason to want to become readers
5831689 this approach opens the door and the mind once a boy starts reading he will be more receptive to many other types of reading over his lifetime

5831700 i knew about a year ago that id put myself up for election again
5831701 the chances of getting elected are pretty small because youve got huge numbers from european countries and new zealands so small
5831702 were quite a small sport and sailors really arent that interested in that sort of stuff but its very big in europe and asia the chances of getting voted on are actually quite slim
5831703 we can tell athletes it is an important mechanism and they should vote but not who they should vote for we dont have an ioc member so it is important to have someone at that level
5831704 i dont know what im going to do the 40 year old mother of two said

5831724 i chose the path that i wanted to take and learned as much as i could for that one thing
5831725 you go to college to kind of figure out what you want to do but if you dont figure it out you go out with debt and you still dont know
5831726 to the extent that people are picking college theyre turning down construction
5831727 mrs smith and the terrible horrible no good very bad day

5831731 we came here to support jason and what a treat this has been we saw him live at the arena but we wanted the chance to see it again keep the celebration going
5831732 to come out and handle the pressure at his first games the way he did and come out with a silver medal is unbelievable
5831733 we were going crazy in the stands he set the bar so high we know it would be really difficult for him and difficult to beat were just so proud of him
5831734 we knew we were right on track we have faith and were confident about out athletes we were waiting for these medals we knew they were coming
5831735 so far its going good we have power and everything its just been windy and rainy

5831740 in my respectful submission the ontario court of appeal was incorrect
5831741 the core issue here is the jurisdiction that is created by the statute and the jurisdiction to grant immunity against third parties is the core issue and remains the core issue from my point of view
5831742 i expect that others will join thats my expectation but i certainly dont want to speak for them
5831743 i hope that premier danny williams has done all he can in his power to secure work
5831744 whether this comes in a year or two or in two days time im coming back here
5831745 thats where the big numbers are in terms of employment
5831746 so it will probably take employment of 3 000 to 4 000 people at the peak period
5831747 when you commit to doing something and the labour is not there to do it that creates problems for the companies
5831748 thats where negotiation gets to be interesting how much can you do here realistically without compromising the project and compromising the schedule
5831749 i would say there at least 1 000 fishery workers without work

5831752 caesar like all the best shavian heroes expresses himself largely through deflationary wit plummer is a complete master of the throwaway that lands an increasingly rare talent by the way he can also and effortlessly assume the grand manner
5831753 the kind of performance that comes along once in a lifetime
5831754 while many of us must surely celebrate the superb editing of dramaturge robert blacker which has transformed this from a shavian sermon to a modern day entertainment we must also acknowledge that in the process much of the political nuance has been jettisoned and mcanuffs direction further erodes it
5831755 the offering of caesar and cleopatra that opened sunday is the kind of production the festival was banking on getting from des mcanuff when he was appointed artistic director showy splashy and saucy it seduces the eye as it warms the heart and stimulates the mind

5831761 and i just remember sitting there eating a plate of ribs and beans or something and i remember seeing this girl walking in the middle of the track with just an unbelievable physique and just glowing i said i need to talk to that lady right there
5831762 luckily were both the type that we sacrifice for each other theres been tears theres ups and downs its just trying to remain calm with a level head now im so ecstatic i cant even describe it
5831763 she can be one of the best hurdlers in the world over and over again

5831767 the fact of the matter is what i will have to decide over the next few weeks is whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament or whether in fact the government a government needs a new mandate
5831768 were going to have to judge how the parliamentary agenda is unfolding
5831769 i think weve had a productive two and a half years i do think that has slowed somewhat in recent weeks but as i say i will take the next few weeks to do a thorough evaluation of the situation and ensure that one way or another we can have a productive parliament in the future
5831770 you have a man who is not respecting parliament and he will not respect his own law
5831771 one important factor in my decision will be what the expectations of canadians are when they expect an election should be held

5831801 more than 20 us dollars clearly shows that there has been speculation in the market
5831802 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5831803 the price must be maintained at a level close to 100 us dollars because the costs have increased
5831804 the market is reacting to reports that opec may cut production
5831805 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5831806 oil has lost its bullish mojo and it may take a major event or a great technical stand to go get its groove back
5831807 the same way this market seemingly overreacted to every bullish nugget of information on the way up it is now ignoring those same nuggets on the way down
5831808 new building codes enacted by new york city accounted for the big jump in permits and starts in june julys 23 6 per cent drop in multi family starts and 32 4 per cent drop in multi family building permits is mostly payback for junes strong numbers

5831810 climbing immediately after the lunch stop was tough but rewarded the riders efforts with the fine trails that lay ahead

5831816 der islam verbietet darstellungen von nacktheit und unmoral er verbietet dass sich m nner und frauen die nicht verheiratet oder ersten grades verwandt sind ber hren in den vergangenen jahrzehnten haben wir am beispiel der westlichen welt sehen k nnen dass die sexuelle freiheit ursache f r perversit t unnat rliches sexuelles verhalten und krankheiten ist derer man nicht mehr herr wird der prophet hat in seinen ausf hrungen eine wichtige unterscheidung getroffen diejenigen ehebrecher die nicht verheiratet sind werden k rperlich gez chtigt und in die verbannung geschickt die verheirateten ehebrecher jedoch werden gesteinigt deswegen m ssen auch alle wege die zu ehebruch f hren verhindert werden zum beispiel d rfen frauen und m nner die nicht verwandt oder verheiratet sind nicht zusammen sein und sich verabreden sie sollen auch nicht so schauen und reden dass man dies f r die vorbereitung eines ehebruchs halten k nnte es gibt auch einen augen und zungenehebruch auch sollen frauen nicht alleine reisen und sie m ssen hinschauen wie sie mit einem fremden mann sprechen sie sollen alle sinne kontrollieren damit der andere sexuell nicht erregt wird frauen sollen ernsthaft und besonnen reden und sie sollen sich sch n zudecken wenn sie vor die t re gehen im islam ist homosexualit t eine gro e s nde analverkehr ist verboten ebenso die onanie wir m gen es nicht wenn man sich mit der hand befriedigt

5831819 die krisen auf politischer und sozialer ebene versch rft und zu einem kontroll und legitimationsverlust der politischen systeme gef hrt
5831820 von den islamischen religionen f hrt kein notwendiger weg in die politik
5831821 so lehnen viele gl ubige die direkte allianz mit der politik die sie als institutionalisierung weltlicher herrschaft und derer interessen sehen um der religi sen reinheit willen ab
5831822 die kritik des islamismus muss eine kritik am rassismus in der kritik am islamismus beinhalten
5831823 die kritik am islamismus antisemitismus und am patriarchat scheint mit einer antirassistischen positionsbestimmung unvereinbar zu sein
5831824 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5831825 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5831826 cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states
5831827 if the recapitalisation talk is realised there are no assurances that the securities that have been issued by u s mortgage firms will be 100 per cent guaranteed
5831828 is printed on every single one of them do you know what a note is well then why are we so stupid as to accept them for money they are only worth about 4 cents of what their value is supposed to be
5831829 margins were impacted for the quarter and we believe well see margin pressure for the remainder of the year
5831830 the improvement signals that fear about an economic downturn among financial market experts is contained the recent fall in the price of oil and the weakening of the euro against the dollar must have dampened concerns about the economy
5831831 market experts have not been particularly taken aback by the negative growth rate of the second quarter they expect weaker but all in all solid economic conditions and do not fear a recession
5831832 the rise did not offset last months fall and the still deeply negative level means that many more investors expect the economy to deteriorate in the next six months than think that it will improve
5831833 both oil and the euro have only simply corrected their sharp advance of recent months and both have made strong gains year on year i e they are still a strain on the economy
5831834 easing pressure from oil and the euro will probably not be sufficient in themselves to trigger a renewed upswing
5831835 it has become crystal clear that markedly slower growth lies ahead as the negative momentum from the global economy is increasingly carrying over into germany
5831836 the euro dollar exchange rate and the oil price might dampen the slowdown but certainly cannot prevent it
5831837 i do not believe that the dollar is going to come back to levels where we can really celebrate
5831838 from this moment a decree of expropriation is in effect and the job stability of workers is guaranteed by the venezuelan state

5831841 determined to safeguard the interests of holcim and its local employees in accordance with the bilateral investment protection agreements in place between switzerland and venezuela
5831842 we are working as a team with the venezuelan government to follow the rising construction market in venezuela
5831843 i think there is still room for negotiation we are not at the point of no return
5831844 the cemex case is very complicated but the numbers which we are using for it are close to the governments offer
5831845 at this point no one is taking responsibility for which law is holding him there
5831846 now i understand that theres a florida law on fugitives that allows them to give no bond and the florida judge said he wont give bond unless the prosecutor here in arizona says its ok which is not happening
5831847 he will sit in jail until he adjudicates the charges there in miami and then well pick him up

5831876 intels entry into the ssd market has been expected for a while and although a bit delayed represents the start of what we expect to be a very competitive market
5831877 the new generation of mlc based products are an improvement over the initial ssd offerings which had a host of issues
5831878 ssds are ideally suited for the netbook category and will eventually replace high performance hard disk drives in the enterprise segment
5831879 we expect mainstream notebooks to continue to utilize hdds for the foreseeable future
5831880 the mlc will go into production in the next 30 days and the slc in the next 90 days
5831881 right now 95 percent of the flash memory consumption is in consumer electronics devices storing photos showing videos if your card fails you throw it away
5831882 we know the data is critical we know enterprise is going to thrash these drives 24 hours a day 7 days a week for years
5831883 bottom line is enterprise users cant count on hard drives you cant predict their failure by being solid state there is that predictive ability you can predict when its going to wear out when its going to fail
5831884 this player is good at video on demand that guys good at iops input output operations per second for database its a highly fractured market
5831885 the differentiation between storage infrastructure will disappear as soon as you can put enough performance and capacity right inside the server

5831889 for me as a carrier i need to satisfy the voip customer whether its mine or someone elses is irrelevant here by delivering those packets in a timely fashion
5831890 that may mean that for economic reasons within the network to keep the cost reasonable to keep the price reasonable that i need to slow down whats not a time sensitive file

5831892 doing a p2p download or e mail they arent going to see that 22 millisecond delay and yet thats the kind of thing that seems to cause paranoia
5831893 governments need to make sure they have a very thorough record
5831894 it was such a great phrase that its morphed into more than what it really is
5831895 you have to peel it back and ask what do you really mean
5831896 i do get very very concerned that the people who are taking things like deep packet inspection and making it a horrible thing need to look at it from an engineers viewpoint
5831897 feel comfortable that their content will be dealt with in the way they truly believe it should be
5831898 i cant tell you that i will police for you

5831903 it shows that the line leading to humans is not as special as many thought

5831905 we unwrapped her and felt she was moving we didnt believe it at first then she began holding my mothers hand and then we saw her open her mouth

5831915 as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at whatever level
5831916 but i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia
5831917 it is something we are going to have to watch
5831918 if its something that is not growing we are going to have to revisit endeavor its comparatively safer than the other stents and thats good
5831919 if im not mistaken there was an improvement on quality of life from stents if not a survival benefit at a certain price point that is worth doing

5831926 works like an internal redispatch to another action while retaining the stash intact
5831927 at this point no one is taking responsibility for which law is holding him there
5831928 now i understand that theres a florida law on fugitives that allows them to give no bond and the florida judge said he wont give bond unless the prosecutor here in arizona says its ok which is not happening
5831929 he will sit in jail until he adjudicates the charges there in miami and then well pick him up

5831970 i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
5831971 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5831972 even in retrospect he would choose the path of failure for america over the path of success and victory
5831973 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5831974 but one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5831975 they came from ordinary places and went on to do extraordinary things
5831976 thereafter at the auspicious time for the appearance of the lord the entire universe was surcharged with all the qualities of goodness beauty and peace the constellation rohini appeared as did stars like asvini the sun the moon and the other stars and planets were very peaceful all directions appeared extremely pleasing and the beautiful stars twinkled in the cloudless sky decorated with towns villages mines and pasturing grounds the earth seemed all auspicious the rivers flowed with clear water and the lakes and vast reservoirs full of lilies and lotuses were extraordinarily beautiful in the trees and green plants full of flowers and leaves pleasing to the eyes birds like cuckoos and swarms of bees began chanting with sweet voices for the sake of the demigods a pure breeze began to blow pleasing the sense of touch and bearing the aroma of flowers and when the brahmanas engaging in ritualistic ceremonies ignited their fires according to vedic principles the fires burned steadily undisturbed by the breeze thus when the birthless lord vishnu the supreme personality of godhead was about to appear the saints and brahmanas who had always been disturbed by demons like kamsa and his men felt peace within the core of their hearts and kettledrums simultaneously vibrated from the upper planetary system
5831977 then the supreme personality of godhead vishnu who is situated in the core of everyones heart appeared from the heart of devaki in the dense darkness of night like the full moon rising on the eastern horizon because devaki was of the same category as sri krishna
5831978 were taking monte ohias hare mate onto the marae and joining with montes family
5831979 thats always been our goal because weve said for many years that its good to have consultation but the real decisions are made around the table where the full council sits and while we can made recommendations to them it doesnt mean we take note of them
5831980 this is a little bit different because its a maori reservation but the same general principle the judge is saying applies that is the building act says all building work it doesnt talk about any particular bits of land it says all building work needs building consents an in fact even within that building act it talks about maori land and how you send notices to multiple owners so there is just no basis for saying maori reservations wouldnt be covered
5831981 the pakeha of the matapouri community have been brought up with our grandparents and great grandparents they eat at each others houses they were more like a maori community than a pakeha community the waahi tapu is as special to them as it is special to the tangata whenua
5831982 those fish stocks big eye and yellowfin are over fished theyre in decline and theyre enormously important to a variety of pacific island nations both for subsistence fishing but also economically
5831983 in new zealand theres an awful lot of talk between policy makers and teachers and researchers about how culture matters and abut how being maori matters but theres not a lot of actually thinking about where do you go from that and in what way does it matter

5832000 we have such a rich tradition jack lovelock john walker peter snell three olympic gold medalists and world record holders i was not able to get the gold but with the standard of competition and spread that this sport has reached worldwide now to get a bronze medal to me means just as much
5832001 i feel sometimes like im representing a huge range of track and field fans
5832002 so its just an honour to be able to carry that mantle and reach the medal podium
5832003 i know theres going to be millions of people around the world to whom this means a lot and give all young kids hope that someone from a town like lower hutt of 100 000 people where track and field is not big i come from a high school of 2000 kids and one of only two people who ran track and to come from that and get a chance to be on the medal podium really means a huge amount

5832014 the probability is growing that the global economy not just the us will experience a serious recession recent developments suggest that all g7 economies are already in recession or close to tipping into one other advanced economies or emerging markets the rest of the eurozone new zealand iceland estonia latvia and some southeast european economies are also nearing a recessionary hard landing when they reach it there will be a sharp slowdown in the brics brazil russia india and china and other emerging markets this looming global recession is being fed by several factors the collapse of housing bubbles in the us uk spain ireland and other euro zone members punctured credit bubbles where money and credit was too easy for too long the severe credit and liquidity crunch following the us mortgage crisis the negative wealth and investment effects of falling stock markets already down by more than 20 per cent globally the global effects via trade links of the recession in the us which still counts for about 30 per cent of global gdp the us dollars weakness which reduces american trading partners competitiveness and the stagflationary effects of high oil and commodity prices which are forcing central banks to increase interest rates to fight inflation at a time when there are severe downside risks to growth and financial stability official data suggest that the us economy entered into a recession in the first quarter of this year the economy rebounded in a double dip w shaped recession in the second quarter boosted by the temporary effects on consumption of 100 billion 68 billion in tax rebates but those effects will fade by late summer the uk spain and ireland are experiencing similar developments with housing bubbles deflating and excessive consumer debt undercutting retail sales thus leading to recession even in italy france greece portugal iceland and the baltic states frothy housing markets are starting to slacken small wonder then that production sales and consumer and business confidence are falling throughout the euro zone elsewhere japan is contracting too japan used to grow modestly for two reasons strong exports to the us and a weak yen now exports to the us are falling while the yen has strengthened moreover high oil prices in a country that imports all of its oil needs together with falling business profitability and confidence are pushing japan into a recession the last of the g7 economies canada should have benefited from high energy and commodity prices but its gdp shrank in the first quarter owing to the contracting us economy indeed three quarters of canadas exports go to the us while foreign demand accounts for a quarter of its gdp so every g7 economy is now headed toward recession other smaller economies mostly the new members of the eu which all have large current account deficits risk a sudden reversal of capital inflows this may already be occurring in latvia and estonia as well as in iceland and new zealand this g7 recession will lead to a sharp growth slowdown in emerging markets and likely tip the overall global economy into a recession

5832123 how can such glaring disparities prevail in a country such as this a wealthy culturally diverse cosmopolitan democracy what is it in canadian society that prevents the poor and marginalized from claiming equal enjoyment to the full range of their rights recognized under law including economic social and cultural rights can such entrenched marginalization really be dismissed as the fault of the marginalized as some would tacitly suggest
5832124 the reason rights talk is resisted by the powerful is precisely because it threatens or promises to rectify distributions of political economic or social power that under internationally agreed standards and values are unjust these truths are laid bare in canadas very hesitant recognition and selective implementation of some of its international human rights obligations but sixty years of disclaiming or belittling the equal status of socio economic rights as enforceable human rights fundamental to the equal worth and dignity of all canadians rings hollow and disingenuous in the light of international and comparative experience the possibility for people themselves to claim their human rights entitlements through legal processes is essential so that human rights have meaning for those most at the margins a vindication of their equal worth and human agency there will always be a place for charity but charitable responses are not an effective principled or sustainable substitute for enforceable human rights guarantees

5832168 can run in any number of physical and virtual oses operating system environments within a server farm as long as the number of physical processors being used by running instances of the software at any one time does not exceed the number of licenses assigned to servers in the server farm
5832169 in a time zone that is within four hours of the local time zone of the other
5832170 count the greatest number of physical processors at any time supporting running instances across your server farm and assign that number of licenses
5832171 these instances run on a server farm made up of 20 servers each with four physical processors if just three unique physical processors support the three running instances then based on the licensing changes you need only three sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses so you can run those three instances anywhere in your server farm if however two physical processors support each of the running instances for a total of six unique physical processors in this scenario you would need six sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses without the licensing changes you would need 80 processor licenses to support moving the instances freely in the server farm

5832195 bei der m nchner ditim bin ich fest davon berzeugt dass sie noch bauen will sie bekommt auch in der nachbarschaft immer mehr zustimmung f r das projekt die frage ist vielmehr wie der t rkische staat sich angesichts des verfassungskonflikts in zukunft im hinblick auf religi se bauvorhaben verhalten wird und welche wege die ditib der dachverband in k ln einschl gt das ist aber jetzt noch nicht abzusch tzen

5832205 ok taxes define rich i mean give me a number is it 50 000 100 000 200 000 everybody keeps talking about who were going to tax how can you define that
5832206 i dont want to take any money from the rich
5832207 a sense of balance and fairness in our tax code
5832208 it is time for folks like me who make more than 250 000 to pay our fair share
5832209 w e will save social security for future generations by asking the wealthiest americans to pay their fair share
5832210 the first part of my plan is to tax the windfall profits of oil companies and use some of that money to help you pay the rising price of gas
5832211 well charlie what ive said is that i would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness
5832212 a sense of balance and fairness in our tax code

5832217 daarom hoeft niemand met goede bedoelingen jegens ons en de westerse wereld er bang voor te zijn
5832218 we laten geen enkel wapen geen enkele kogel voor georgi dat deze bloedige slachtpartij heeft verricht en dat onze weerloze vredessoldaten en burgers in zuid osseti heeft gefusilleerd

5832221 the president functions as a grand employer who has a complaint box each of us may get our two cents in once after that were on our own because there is no special treatment for the vast majority of americans today there is very special treatment for white upper middle class heterosexual men and their spouses and children there is special treatment for fundamentalist christians and fetuses i am a 41 year old american a female a lesbian from a working class background a poet performer and writer making my living pretty exclusively from those activities ive lived the majority of my adult life under the poverty level without health care more americans are like me than george bush why is he ruling this country and our lives
5832222 up river points of interest from the battery to troy
5832223 is made possible by the leadership council of the new museum
5832224 understand that whats lacking right now is not good ideas
5832225 the problem we have is that washington has become a place where good ideas go to die
5832226 the african american community is as american as apple pie
5832227 taking a program meant to help poor children and turning it into one that covers children in households with incomes of up to 83 000 a year
5832228 would move millions of american children who now have private health insurance into government run health care
5832229 what im describing here is a philosophical divide that exists in washington over the best approach for health care
5832230 an incremental step toward the goal of government run health care
5832231 i learned a clear lesson from the lead up to the
5832232 if you give this president an inch he will take a mile and launch a war
5832233 this is a lesson that i think senator clinton and others should have learned
5832234 you cant give this president a blank check and then act surprised when he cashes it
5832235 i know a little about what happened in the 1930s
5832236 what we see here is a real opportunity for people to come out and experience nascar in temperate conditions and we believe it certainly will help with our attendance and help us to continue to grow
5832237 were having to pinch ourselves here to be sure this is really happening we know how complicated the schedule change was to complete
5832238 i would argue that if you are making more than 250 000 then you are in the top 3 4 percent of this country
5832239 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
5832240 to be fair to both of them rich is an adjective
5832241 economic science is not going to tell you that this is the cutoff point
5832242 if you set the bar at half a million youre talking about the top 1 of taxpayers if you think about the last eight years those are the folks who have benefited the most
5832243 give me a specific number is it 100 000 dollars is it 50 200
5832244 if you do surveys 95 of people think they are middle class
5832245 this is including people who are objectively quite poor and people who are objectively quite rich
5832246 i guess it says something nice about america that rich people dont want to act like theyre better than anybody else and poor people dont like complaining about how tough it is to pay their bills
5832247 it should come as no surprise that john mccain believes the cutoff for the rich begins at 5 million
5832248 it may explain why his tax plan gives a 600 000 tax cut to the richest 0 1 of earners
5832249 some of the richest people ive known in my life are the most unhappy
5832250 by a home a good job and education and the ability to hand our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one we inherited
5832251 we are being obstructed because we can win we have the votes and the government knows that if it allows us in the race the myth that ch vez is the sole representative of the poor masses of venezuela will be destroyed so they are trying to force me out
5832252 venezuela has been very focused and disciplined about pursuing influence in the rest of the hemisphere but there hasnt been a clear alternative
5832253 whats important is that the united states advances an agenda that makes a priority of democracy and human rights as well as poverty alleviation and addressing inequality ch vez has no answer to that
5832254 there are limits to how quickly you can draw down without risking real chaos
5832255 tell the iraqis they have to convince us we can go
5832256 but trying to capture it and lock it away could allow other repeat offenders to go free
5832257 power plant emissions that cause acid rain water pollution and destruction of the ozone layer may actually be made worse by capturing the co2 and pumping it deep underground a new study reported online and in an upcoming international journal of greenhouse gas control suggests this increase of other emissions is largely because collecting and burying co2 requires additional energy new equipment and new chemical reactions at the plants and using current technology meeting all of these requirements releases extra pollutants
5832258 the decision to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions is going to be intertwined with decisions about how to deal with these other emissions

5832275 they are saying that they love their country they love the flag that they are rotting in the jungle and please do something for them
5832276 this is what your demand for democracy in pakistan has brought about
5832277 democratic governments in pakistan have been set up for failure
5832278 all of this is sapping a lot of energy and taking attention away from a lot of other things
5832279 while its difficult for people to get used to in the end it will be better for the united states to work with a pakistani democracy rather than a single general
5832280 instead of having one person who makes commitments he doesnt live up to
5832281 you have multiple power centers that come to a consensus then implement it
5832282 we cant fool ourselves we cant fool our own people
5832283 by refusing us nato will be sending a signal to russia of go and get them

5832285 a functioning concert of democracies would not only be much in the american national interest it could be in important measure transformative for the world
5832286 crises in iran north korea iraq and darfur not to mention the pressing need for more efficient peacekeeping operations the rising temperatures of our seas and multiple other transnational threats demonstrate not only the limits of american unilateral power but also the inability of international institutions designed in the middle of the 20th century to cope with the problems of the 21st

5832288 we cant stop the people of pakistan and they cannot tolerate another stolen election
5832289 its very important that people in the united states that lawmakers in the united states realize that the strategy of backing one man rather than the democratic process is deeply flawed

5832320 i think it would help with the whole drunk driving thing because if we start drinking younger it would help get the image out to calm down
5832321 i think it would cause less of a binge drinking which is something that needs to decrease because a lot of kids do it and a lot of kids dont start drinking till their first year in college and they dont know how to handle themselves after a beer
5832322 we cant step in when theres a problem because their hiding it from us if we address the drinking age and if we consider changing it one of the outcomes would be that we would be able to educate out students better and step in when students have drinking problems
5832323 syracuse university does not necessarily endorse a drinking age of 18 but we feel this is a topic worthy of study and discussion which is why we signed on to the amethyst initiative we look forward to being part of the national dialogue

5832341 russia is a country of legal nihilism no european country can boast such a universal disregard for the rule of law
5832342 freedom is inseparable from the actual recognition by the people of the power of law the supremacy of the law should become one of our basic values
5832343 one of the key elements of our work in the next four years will be ensuring the independence of our legal system from the executive and legislative branches of power
5832344 i think mr medvedev is just another face of mr putin on the other hand it provides an opportunity to follow up on the rhetoric about the rule of law if mr medvedev says a maybe it is possible to pressure him to say b what can b be it can be specific steps for restoring and enforcing legal norms
5832345 it seems to me that a country that is a member of the
5832346 the relationship has come full circle which feels like a good thing considering where we have been

5832348 we share the same values democracy human rights the functioning of the free market we are working together jointly for the same goals in the region

5832364 of what did she find out and what did they want her to find out
5832365 i believe my volunteerism over 30 years to nonprofit organizations with disparate program goals has given me practical insights on what strategies are most effective my experience with broad coalitions working together for societal change has proven to me that our organization is on the right track to make our neighborhoods safer and to give our children their full life potential
5832366 shes been active in everything and involved in every single major gun violence prevention organization
5832367 she had access to all the legislative strategy for every major issue for years
5832368 she never talked about what she had done prior to this work i didnt even know if she had a husband or kids
5832369 she doesnt talk about her family i know nothing about her personal life other than that she lives in sarasota florida for my closest friends in this movement who also know mary it was a matter of low level discussion that we didnt know anything about her
5832370 those are very sensitive issues and im just not comfortable going into it im really not
5832371 i did a number of different things for the nra in the area of investigation the area of personal protection in the area of event security in the area of intelligence gathering okay
5832372 we used informants that we would send to public rallies that these people were holding public demonstrations these informants developed relationships where they could pick up a phone up and call in to find out where the next event was where it was going to be held they are usually very eager to have somebody come and tote banners and scream and shout
5832373 i dont have anything to say about any vendors at the nra
5832374 she was very very good everybody knew her for years and trusted her
5832375 i would find it hardest to believe this about her she comes across as kind of dense or shes putting on a good act
5832376 she had access to all the legislative strategy for every major issue for years
5832377 she was one of those rare people as a volunteer she wanted to know more and more about what people were working on
5832378 learn a lot what the grassroots of the gun violence prevention movement intended where our priorities are shifting which legislation we would be promoting or fighting against and what sort of effort we would be putting into that who our targeted legislators would be what states and districts we deemed important enough to put an effort into our messaging what our messaging would be before we put it out there
5832379 she immediately asked to be on the email list of the opponents and she also got on the phone calls so she now knows the strategy of the people trying to fight this
5832380 whenever an issue comes up she manages to get on the email list
5832381 would confirm for me the way that the gun lobby works which is no rules no question of fairness or honesty anything that they can do they will do to protect the profits of the gun industry

5832390 im familiar with what you are doing but i dont want to talk to the media
5832391 we disagree with the administration that the endangered species act isnt a perfectly appropriate act to address global warming
5832392 the pika is very much the polar bear of the lower 48
5832393 the pika is the american wests canary in the coal mine
5832394 as temperatures rise pika populations at lower elevations are being driven to extinction pushing pikas further upslope until they have nowhere else to go
5832395 this is unprofessional and undignified behavior on the part of speaker bass
5832396 assemblywoman parra was elected by the people of her district to represent them in the capitol building by kicking the assemblywoman and her staff out of the capitol speaker bass has effectively told the people of assemblywoman parras district that their voice will not be represented or heard in the capitol
5832397 this type of political punishment proves that democrats will not tolerate independent thought
5832398 how many other lawmakers are being bullied and intimidated by democrat leadership for refusing to join them in their out of control spending
5832399 we urge all citizens to call assembly speaker karen bass and ask her why shes kicked assemblywoman nicole parra out of the office her constituents voted her into
5832400 and we urge them to call assemblywoman parra and their legislator and encourage them to hold the line against higher taxes and irresponsible spending
5832401 it got very sophisticated because obviously the battery doesnt last long and then we had to look at circuits and interrupters so we have been working on it around two months with a crack team
5832402 i made it i finally won a gold medal i cant stop smiling im so excited
5832403 but i go by everything happens for a reason and for some reason the judges were giving me scores im not used to but they had a reason
5832404 it did upset me a little but i thought about it and i decided i was at the olympic games i was having the time of my life and im winning medals
5832405 when you do get silver you feel different emotions but i looked back and appreciated that i had a medal
5832406 if it were gold it might feel differently i dont know how to explain it i definitely came to appreciate it i wouldnt trade my silver medals for anything in the world not even gold
5832407 the more mistakes you make in practice the more you worry
5832408 i wanted to do my best routine i didnt want to leave the olympics thinking i could do better

5832413 were scraping along the bottom but the interesting thing about this bottom is that its going to be volatile
5832414 every time you think the patients stabilized theres another organ failure
5832415 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump
5832416 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall
5832417 reflect the recent significant fall in oil prices which everyone would like to see continue
5832418 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5832419 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5832420 coupling the two you have slow growth with higher inflation

5832455 una pol tica de derechos humanos y de una institucionalidad m s fuerte
5832456 la presidenta encomend definir esta resoluci n que reconocer el derecho a la pensi n por viudez a las personas del mismo sexo al igual que se les reconoce a los convivientes de distinto sexo sin necesidad de recurrir a la justicia
5832457 es el reconocimiento de un derecho no es una promoci n de nuevas formas de familia ya que si busc ramos eso tendr amos que reformar el c digo civil y no es la idea
5832458 es una nueva interpretaci n de las normas a la luz de la reforma constitucional de los tratados internacionales suscriptos por la argentina y de la experiencia de otros pa ses
5832459 replantear en el mbito de la anses el criterio adoptado hasta la fecha
5832460 interpretar las normas vigentes de acuerdo con esa igualdad de trato para el otorgamiento de derechos fundamentales como son los derivados de la seguridad social

5832464 al momento del allanamiento la madre y la hermana negaron la presencia de corres en su vivienda al afirmar que no sab an donde se encontraba pero luego se determin que en la misma estaba en un lugar especial acondicionado y escondido
5832465 hizo movimientos de desplazamientos de varios lugares y hasta que no se tuvo la certeza absoluta de una vigilancia y procesamiento de informaci n que se trabaj durante todo el fin de semana no se hizo el allanamiento en la finca donde vive su madre
5832466 de ser necesario se trasladar en su momento para el juicio o para su declaraci n pero es muy precipitado evaluarlo
5832467 lo importante es tener asegurada su buena detenci n y ac en bah a blanca no existen buenas condiciones y el d a que tenga que venir ser por el juicio o por alguna diligencia particular
5832468 no hay una responsabilidad de corres en la medida de que no hubo un hecho violento pero s en el caso de los que facilitaron la fuga como el comisario y subcomisario que est n presos como procesados el oficial y suboficial de guardia de la delegaci n de la polic a federal sin perjuicio de que sigan involucr ndose a otros protagonistas de la fuga
5832469 el s bado declar el subcomisario voros en un interrogatorio muy amplio en el que no asumi su responsabilidad y lo deleg en el oficial de guardia es decir que cada uno fue desligando responsabilidades en otro
5832470 por su parte el comisario scelsi hab a dicho durante su declaraci n que en el tema de seguridad iba a tener instrucciones del subcomisario para tener las medidas correspondientes es decir que cada uno deslind responsabilidades para lavarse las manos

5832496 it may be typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement but most americans have the humility and gratitude to respect and learn from the memories of men who suffered on behalf of others

5832503 faith bronsons happy prosperous life goes up in smoke one evening when she discovers her husband making love to another man david bronson is a conservative christian and a lobbyist who works for promise the children a family values oriented organization unfortunately for faith and david she is not the only one who discovers him with his lover the news media does as well and they pound the story into the ground until david is catapulted from the closet suddenly david has no job faith has no marriage and neither one of them has any money they also have two messed up kids faiths refuge turns out to be a row house on prospect street that has been in her mothers family for four now five generations she cant abide the idea of living with her rigid demanding parents so when her mother offers her the house she is overjoyed at the idea of living in georgetown despite the fact that the house is horribly dilapidated faiths son alex is happy with the move but her daughter remy makes her disapproval heard loud and long remy also has major issues with her father and chooses not to see him at all instead faiths ever perfect daughter becomes the rebellious teenager from hell faith has her hands full juggling all the disasters but while she is renovating her house faith makes two important discoveries the first is that the house itself is endlessly fascinating it is her family history a history shes not known much about until now it also contains some answers to the question of her parents marriage almost forty years ago faiths older sister hope was abducted from the house as a newborn and this tragedy has cast a long shadow over the entire family her other discovery is that she has an intriguing neighbor in pavel quinn another georgetown renovator he is obviously attracted to faith can she learn to trust another man with her heart faith is a wonderful character she is perhaps a bit staid and predictable at first but her trials seem to bring out the best in her shes hard working creative intelligent and despite her diminished self confidence she manages to be quite assertive when she has to be the best parts of the book are when shes sticking it to david and refusing to be blamed for his mistakes shes also pretty good with remy who grows more and more sullen and uncooperative over time prospect street is womens fiction in its truest form the story is primarily faiths but all of her relationships are explored we get into the heads of her mother her daughter her husband and her new love interest all of them have things to resolve with faith before the story can have a true happy ending the use of so many points of view can muddle a story but richards carefully keeps the whole thing on track by focusing on how all of these characters interact with faith other things such as davids new relationship or her mothers rocky marriage do not take up excessive page space all of the characters go through a similar character arc as they learn to live honestly by their own standards and try to forgive themselves and others when they fail this is a profoundly empathetic and compassionate book and other than the message of forgiveness richards does not use her book platform to preach she shows all the ways that faith and davids situation can be devastating to a family and lets all of her characters feel their natural emotions there is no pro gay or anti gay message david for all of his betrayal and cowardice is a ultimatly a sympathetic character these are simply real people with real problems muddling through as best they can richards exploration of the christian churchs conflict with homosexuality is well written david spent years trying to convince himself and his children that homosexuality was a sin and now he must face his own beliefs and convictions as well as the consequences of his preaching richards doesnt waste time vilifying religious people though and may i say how much i appreciated this so often christians are portrayed as narrow minded fanatical bigoted idiots and richards does not stereotype this way the mystery of the house was intriguing and richards reveals the clues to the mystery of hopes kidnapping slowly a bit at a time to hold the interest of the reader the flashbacks to faiths mothers life in the early years of her marriage are well done and reinforce the books theme and message even the parts about the houses restoration are interesting its such a nice metaphor for the restoration of faiths life as the house is stripped bare and lovingly restored to highlight the character of whats beneath so is faith she and the house go through the same process
5832504 the majority of egyptians are like us under the age of 35
5832505 its time to get out and work with groups that have concrete problems
5832506 people who are living in upper egypt dont care about the emergency law but if we can relate this to their rights as a woman or as a christian copt or as a person who cannot get work we can recruit them to the overall cause of reform
5832507 the united states has decided it needs mubarak more than they need to support the human rights cause
5832508 we are in trouble and we need to work our way out of it
5832509 we are not just saying we are some idealistic group so help us
5832510 we are saying this is in your national interest reform in egypt is important to the united states the theory that the devil you know is better than the devil you dont doesnt work because the devil you know brought you mohamed atta
5832511 syria is determined that the presidential election will not happen
5832512 in their eyes they are winning this conflict they are killing people in the streets of beirut and nothing is happening to them
5832513 when rafiq hariri was assassinated the whole world talked with one language and when the whole world said it syria got out of lebanon because they were afraid that the world would isolate syria
5832514 there are no unknowns in this process we know exactly what are the red lines of these people
5832515 and they have learned exactly what are the red lines on our side
5832516 nobody says anything about turning a corner seeing lights at the end of tunnels any of those phrases
5832517 i have not detected a great deal of nervousness that we are simply going to pull the plug and allow this to spiral back downward
5832518 at the most fundamental level there is a view in iraq that things are moving in the right direction that security is improving that the surge has worked that iraqi forces are more numerous and more capable and that therefore why on earth would we abandon a winning proposition
5832519 every member of congress be briefed on this incident and as soon as possible
5832520 human rights situation in palestine and other occupied arab territories
5832521 a shadow on the united nations system as a whole
5832522 has for the most part abandoned initiating any country specific resolutions
5832523 is certainly not ideal we have a basis we can work with
5832524 that could happen but i dont think were anywhere near there
5832525 to send a directive to every u s ambassador in an unfree nation seek out and meet with activists for democracy seek out those who demand human rights
5832526 say what they say do what they do howl where they want the license will not be renewed
5832527 ch vezs position is that no one can change the decisions i make and anyone who tries to do so is a traitor
5832528 that includes the judges on the supreme court the oas anyone who disagrees with him is an enemy
5832529 are those who approach the subject in a friendly and businesslike manner who have studied the subject thoroughly and who over time earn respect that makes it harder for the subject to evade the questions
5832530 a disastrous thing comparable only to the time of hitler when there were clandestine jails with prisoners who did not have names its monstrous
5832531 dissidents who could not join us because they are being unjustly imprisoned
5832532 every day brings us closer to a broad operation in gaza
5832533 but if we will find it necessary to operate in gaza we will operate in gaza for the security of israeli citizens
5832534 you can feel egypt is on the back burner right now everyone is in despair about the situation
5832535 but when the fighting started last month they were not out there with us in the outposts instead they effectively said you are on your own its put us in a very difficult position and i mean all of us who supported democracy in the greater middle east
5832536 is it a red line to expose the corruption of prominent figures to report on demonstrations and the discontent of large segments of society to report that there is a scarcity of water and that prices are going up
5832537 there is no place for a respectable and honorable journalist anymore
5832538 he must be an employee working for state security he must either be raised on writing reports and selling his friends out or be a hypocrite and a coward
5832539 this is a very hard earned space we have and it is not going to be given up easily its really too early to see what the outcome of this is going to be
5832540 even if i have to stage a sit in or a hunger strike in one of the government offices
5832541 a mediocre scorer if hes playing higher than the third line the teams in trouble good news is hes an above average foruth liner
5832542 urinary arsenic reflects exposures from all routes air water and food which makes it difficult to track the actual source of arsenic exposure let alone use the results from this study to establish drinking water standards
5832543 was willing to take chances to expose himself to criticism to face the accusatory voices both domestic and international he did everything in order to realize the opportunity
5832544 this is a legacy according to which i intend to lead the state of israel over the coming months
5832545 they admire american institutions they admire american education they admire the openness of our society
5832546 in the classroom they are treated no differently from other students
5832547 when we talk to them we always get encouraging words
5832548 whats needed from the united states and what has been lacking is a strong message to all sides that it is in their interest to abide by democratic principles
5832549 the message were getting is that the united states really doesnt care
5832550 we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom
5832551 the president was very forceful in saying that hes not going to give up the agenda
5832552 its not that the democracy policy was adopted and applied and turned out not to work
5832553 there was never a strategy for applying it there was no unity of purpose hardly any political leaders besides bush believed in the concept even here in america there was terrible resistance its not enough that the president believes in the policy and wants to act he has to be able to carry the country and the bureaucracy with him
5832554 then one after another we were arrested carter spoke out but did nothing
5832555 its a very rare phenomenon that this policy exists in a u s government
5832556 it existed for a short period of time in the 70s and it existed for a brief time now more strongly it will come back again and stronger the next time it will happen because the countries of the free world will realize that we are in a fight for survival with extremist ideology around the world and we have no stronger weapon than the desire of people to live in freedom
5832557 never let the future disturb you you will meet it if you have to with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present lokasi above the cloud below the ground post 4 268 klo pengacara ada tes nya dl sama badan2 pengacara gt klo dokter hrs sekolah lg cmiiw all mib gt revo 41 broken 42 ingram movie 45 griffon aqua semua mib medicom rah darth vader rots eps 3 12

5832572 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5832573 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5832574 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over

5832577 this is another example of how campbellsville university impacts our community and region and how we in turn benefit from the close working relationship we feel with our community leaders and residents
5832578 the world has literally come to campbellsville university as well as to our larger community were thankful that our faculty staff and students are very much involved in the betterment of this fine community
5832579 we are proud to help in any way this is part of the process of community learning i want people to know that i see the cie as a service most directly to the university but also a service to the community and region opportunities for our international students to be involved outside the campus are very helpful in making them feel accepted and more at home
5832580 it was a great time to meet with and help people from my country
5832581 i hope it helped them to know more good things about campbellsville
5832582 we want people to see these campuses firsthand and have an opportunity to talk with staff and current students about the admissions process and financial aid
5832583 many people are surprised to find out how attainable and affordable an independent college education can be
5832584 while non traditional students are always welcome at all campuses more than half of kentuckys independent colleges offer special opportunities for working adults

5832592 the greatest tragedy is that my brother is in a position of authority over other peoples lives and my greatest concern is not necessarily for justification in my case but how this instability in his character might impact the lives of others
5832593 when we first got on the plane people noticed a strange odor
5832594 the odor persisted and people continued asking what the odor was it smelled like something was burning
5832595 we believe the cause of the smoke was a blown oil seal in one of the engines
5832596 that caused oil to splatter onto the fan blades heating up the oil and causing it to smoke
5832597 when a flight attendant helped me we found the mask wasnt working
5832598 were investigating reports that some did not come down out of the ceiling panel and others didnt work
5832599 i assumed the ground crew would roll up stairways and we would all get off

5832609 new drilling has got to be part of our energy solution
5832610 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
5832611 this settlement was reached without any admission of liability on behalf of the city and the individual defendants
5832612 although defendants believe that they would ultimately have prevailed at a trial the costs of going forward weighed in favor of a settlement at this time
5832613 this is an attempt to be more family friendly to provide parents more information
5832614 please do not test the georgian states patience lets give peace and dialogue a chance
5832615 college students dont realize that anything they do now will stay on their credit report for the next seven to 10 years
5832616 theres an economic impact to ignoring the complexity of information
5832617 scooping information out of the air thats where the future is going its not just pcs
5832618 part of my management style is to push the envelope
5832619 lets do creative things and make it happen i try to inspire people to do the impossible
5832620 so we cant talk about what we do because they want to take credit for it
5832621 its like going to a little resort at the end of the day
5832622 is amazing its got the amenities without the challenges and with google seagate and others theres a lot of interesting stuff happening here
5832623 i think weve got an environment where we didnt see much of a change from the second quarter
5832624 we think that says more about our performance than any material change in the environment
5832625 by accelerating our enterprise growth and executing well across the portfolio h p delivered a strong third quarter performance

5832629 social networking sites such as facebook are a fast growing phenomenon
5832630 social network users need to realise that the information and photos they put into cyberspace in some cases can be seen by others and can leave a digital tattoo that can be difficult to erase
5832631 the latest research from the us suggests 44 per cent of employers are now using sites like myspace and facebook to research job candidates
5832632 as a general rule its best not to publish information you would not want the world to know
5832633 i was sent to a nursing home instead of a rehabilitation centre where i was with people more than twice my age and received no therapy whatsoever
5832634 i would love to meet the doctors who initially saw me in my first hospital who said i would remain a vegetable for life and never be able to talk or walk if i didnt die
5832635 we know very little about brain injury but what we do know is that it takes time to recover
5832636 at the moment resources are so scarce that unless people can demonstrate capacity to recover very quickly they are usually left out and end up in a nursing home because they need a nursing level of care
5832637 we just dumped everything out had to start all over again
5832638 theres 25 percent who stop and look and theyll turn around and leave
5832639 people are nervous theyre seeing the headlines so its slower than usual
5832640 me parece que cuando se intenta generar una agenda electoral a partir de las leg timas preocupaciones de la gente pero sin ir al fondo se puede dar un uso perverso yo creo que tenemos claridad de que la seguridad es un derecho y eso esperamos que se cumpla
5832641 me demuestra que se puede tener un futuro en el arte me alegra que otras personas apoyen nuestro trabajo y dedicaci n
5832642 esto para m es un logro porque la competencia es bien fuerte hay excelentes bailarines que tambi n han ganado este premio esto nos abre muchas puertas para el futuro
5832643 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5832644 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5832645 god certainly did shed his grace on america with the leadership of barack obama
5832646 if you dont want to have to dig it up always plant a pvc pipe under it
5832647 anyone who leaves the movie with more intolerance than they walked in with wasnt paying attention

5832649 they will continue to operate under the supervision of an interim administrator
5832650 without a reorganization plan in place soon the company could face severe consequences and these same institutions will likely recover far less than under the ripplewood proposal
5832651 we are holding out little hope that this proposal will be approved
5832652 these banks and hedge funds are once again going to disappoint all of the 23 000 employees of interstate just like they have disappointed the nation with the mortgage debacle
5832653 were hopeful that the parties will reach agreement on concessions that would allow ibc to emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a stand alone company
5832654 we are in constant contact with our donors and supporters and it wouldnt be at all surprising if people were soliciting their thoughts about any aspect of the campaign
5832655 the vast majority have no doubt mccain is qualified for the white house as don frederick notes
5832656 the findings indicate that the mccains camp controversial advertising thrust of late depicting obama as a mere
5832657 the findings also suggest that to stem the inroads mccain has made against him obama needs to change the conversation after all its not as if hes going to be able to substantially beef up his resume in the two and a half months until election day
5832658 passion category the percentage of supporters who call themselves very excited about his candidacy
5832659 strongly patriotic while just 55 percent view obama as the same
5832660 original mavericks public reputation just 30 percent said yes and 56 percent said no
5832661 yes the bronx is burning burning hot with cultural events amazing architecture tight knit residential communities and acres and acres of wide open green space

5832665 he satan is a liar and the farther of it
5832666 exterior sunshades or silk screened fritted glass will be utilized to reduce interior glare and improve thermal comfort
5832667 dont see too much about the oculus on here 50 west 15th street but the scaffolding just came down
5832668 the northside piers toll brothers building a group of disgruntled union workers protesting the use of non union workers which according to one of the protesters are illegal laborers
5832669 whats going on with the dumpy former howard johnson on w 34th street across from penn station it was abruptly shuttered complete with handwritten instructions to guests that they should
5832670 will be the final leg of the political race this year
5832671 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5832672 as a political proposition it would have much easier for me to have just signed on to what i considered flawed legislation im proud to say that the result is a law that better serves our military better serves military families and better serves the interests of our country
5832673 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5832674 we knew it would be a long and tough war all along
5832675 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5832676 on pbs a program that traced the genealogy of 19 prominent african americans back to the slavery era recent breakthroughs in dna study now allow population geneticists to reach further back into the past than ever before as census records for black americans exist only after the civil war
5832677 were going to drag you into historical archives about the civil war
5832678 were going to trace your family through those periods and to those periods
5832679 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5832680 representantes de una gran minor a y que muy poca gente conoce por eso dijo no vamos a permitir que se vuelva a colapsar la ciudad
5832681 estamos trabajando de la mano con las secretar as de gobierno y movilidad y hasta ahora no hay motivos para ir a un paro
5832682 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
5832683 this settlement was reached without any admission of liability on behalf of the city and the individual defendants
5832684 although defendants believe that they would ultimately have prevailed at a trial the costs of going forward weighed in favor of a settlement at this time
5832685 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5832686 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5832687 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5832688 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5832689 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5832690 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5832691 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5832692 everybody in this room could be donating to some other cause or to their own well being but i want to thank you
5832693 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5832694 i found it striking that bush has talked about looking into musharrafs eyes its the same metaphor he used with putin
5832695 there can be no more business as usual under present circumstances
5832696 a new line in europe where russia somehow asserts that there are those who cannot opt for a transatlantic future is unacceptable
5832697 lots of administrations have tended to personalize their relationships with whoever is in charge in pakistan
5832698 this administration has been at the high end in that regard
5832699 we might not have been as good as we could have been at setting priorities
5832700 i would not force this issue if i was the us government
5832701 this was a great opportunity for us sugar to get out of the business and give a potentially big boost to republican gov charlie crist and the republicans on the environment
5832702 this is unprecedented in terms of a state buyout of a private company for the purposes of conservation
5832703 the sugar industry in florida has been problematic for years
5832704 its always been two faced the economic bonus to the state has been huge but the ecological damage it causes has been tremendous
5832705 they removed the mangroves filled in the swamplands and inhabited the barrier islands
5832706 if you want to put florida back like it used to be those areas should also
5832707 if people are told you have to readjust in the interest of the everglades thats noble
5832708 we dont refer to them as playgrounds because they are more than that
5832709 school leaders over the last few years have really started to look at these connections between health and wellness and kids being successful in schools
5832710 the kids sort of recognize this as kind of a special place theyre quieter more orderly
5832711 if the school department had just gone in and rebuilt the schoolyard i dont think there would have been nearly as good an impact the fact that they got the teachers involved and the parents and neighborhoods made this project more successful
5832712 the stronger dollar at this point is a net positive
5832713 there has been enough depreciation to give us a boost and enough stability to help us on the inflation front
5832714 if the dollar continues to strengthen it does open the door for oil prices to move lower
5832715 whereas two months ago some thought the european central bank would raise interest rates now things in europe are looking pretty shaky
5832716 japanese exports are lower than a year ago and that is the first time that has happened in the post world war ii period
5832717 in san pedro bay the port of los angeles and the port of long beach loaded exports increased 22 5 percent for the first six months of 2008 compared to the same period last year
5832718 the stronger dollar will not work its way through until 2009
5832719 the recent strength of the dollar hasnt trickled down yet
5832720 its good for business bad for shopping in new york
5832721 the sale was driven by the strength of the pound sterling
5832722 with the type of volume were dealing with we dont feel a 5 percent change in currency
5832723 we get 400 to 600 different types of cheeses and the vast majority are european from italian parmigiano reggiano to spanish manchegos i suspect we will be able to charge less
5832724 this is an attempt to be more family friendly to provide parents more information
5832725 theres a lot of guys out there its a competitive market were doing the best we can and we feel our numbers show up well right there
5832726 when you look whats happening youve got a lot of places around the planet where the only access to digital content is through a laptop and wireless card we have a significant opportunity there we do our best to take advantage of it we have to deploy great products world class support
5832727 we saw accelerating local currency growth in the americas and in the u s i would not necessarily take that as a market trend our execution in the quarter was good
5832728 we are every excited about growth opportunities for hp and eds we think we can accelerate our reach into key enterprise accounts the vast majority of customers that i talk to speak of the combined power of hp innovation and edss scaled services business
5832729 the idea is not to introduce new requirements but some clarifications will lead to certain changes in the way you do things
5832730 the standard has always recommended that wep not be used but now theyre putting in a timeline
5832731 there are so many companies now using the new iphones which can connect
5832732 they have expanded the scope of antivirus software to include all operating systems but that just focuses on known types of malicious software
5832733 hannaford and other stores were targeted attacks using software written specifically for point of sale devices not known malicious software
5832734 the standard is not helping protect companies from unknown or new threats that emerge
5832735 these three should be mandatory on point of sale systems
5832736 antivirus doesnt protect against the self modifying viruses the bad guys are coming up with
5832737 ringback tones are quickly becoming the golden child of the mobile music market due to a winning combination of consumer popularity and minimal impact from drm or piracy
5832738 all the negative attacks from the mccain campaign seem to have been paying off
5832739 we hope our victory helps convince the city to stop violating peoples rights as a matter of policy and stop wasting taxpayers money doing so
5832740 the nypd violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
5832741 this settlement was reached without any admission of liability on behalf of the city and the individual defendants
5832742 this technology is important because it addresses many issues eliminating waste producing economical fuel quickly and being friendly to our environment
5832743 its a win win for industry and consumers furthermore this technology is ready to be commercialized now and does not require any new scientific or technological breakthroughs to become a reality
5832744 our goal with this technology is to achieve as much as a 2 percent contribution to the nation s gasoline demand by 2022 through the building of 200 more bio refineries
5832745 we firmly believe the tees technology combined with the byogy team offers this possibility
5832746 our plan is to produce two and a half billion gallons or more of carbon neutral renewable gasoline per year said daniel l rudnick chief executive officer of byogy we are positioning ourselves not only to handle the opportunity biomass waste streams that are available today but also the sustainable biomass energy crops of the future this green substitute for conventional gasoline is the holy grail of all biofuels
5832747 my government said gays and homosexuals dont exist they are only found in europe or america
5832748 i always get anonymous calls from men asking for lube
5832749 they tell me not to ask any questions and just put the lube inside a magazine and leave it in the cafes or streets
5832750 many young and recently diagnosed hiv positive men have therapeutic optimism thinking that with the availability of certain treatments in the past nine years or so the disease is curable and they are not infectious
5832751 because the hepatitis c virus attacks the liver and hiv aids patients receive highly toxic antiretroviral drugs that take a toll on the liver it makes treatment much more complicated
5832752 were making a proposal to the government to prescribe men with viagra in order to increase their chance of using condoms
5832753 aurelio baldor mi padre era el educador m s importante de la isla cubana durante los a os cuarenta y cincuenta
5832754 fue un hombre tranquilo y enorme enamorado de la ense anza y de mi madre quien hoy lo sobrevive y se pasaba el d a ideando acertijos matem ticos y juegos con n meros
5832755 mi padre era un hombre devoto de dios de la patria y de su familia
5832756 cada d a rez bamos el rosario y todos los domingos sin falta bamos a misa de seis una costumbre que no se perdi ni siquiera despu s en el exilio
5832757 fidel fue a decirle a mi padre que la revoluci n estaba con la educaci n y que le agradec a su valiosa labor de maestro pero ya estaba planeando otra cosa
5832758 era el 19 de julio de 1960 y l estaba m s sombr o que de costumbre mi padre era un hombre que no dejaba traslucir sus emociones muy anal tico de una fachada estricta dur sima pero ese d a algo misterioso en su mirada nos dec a que las cosas no andaban bien y que el viaje no era de recreo
5832759 what about my own contract situation i am just happy playing my football but if anything like that comes about ill be delighted
5832760 ive got this season and two more years left im happy really happy with how things are going happy here at aston villa
5832761 i am just looking to build on the performances of last season during this season and im glad we got off to a good start at the weekend against manchester city
5832762 would i like to commit to a new contract of course it is a fantastic club i am delighted im playing here
5832763 ashley has been fantastic for us and we are in conversation with him over that a new contract
5832764 the russian forces that were not there prior to august 6 that were part of the peacekeeping mission the agreement calls for them to be withdrawn out of georgia so far we have not seen any significant movement
5832765 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out so i would expect them to begin an immediate withdrawal which is their commitment we want them to honor their commitment
5832766 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
5832767 barack obama has been a very strong champion of equal pay for equal work
5832768 the opportunity for pay equity bills to move through congress
5832769 youve got to keep the coalition together the republican base is just coming home
5832770 the united states will have to depend on foreign rockets and spacecraft to send americans to orbit
5832771 as president ill make our space program a priority again by devoting the attention and resources needed to not only inspire the world with feats of exploration but also improve life here on earth
5832772 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5832773 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of senator obama let me say just in case senator obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting nasa funding i oppose such cuts
5832774 i will ensure that space exploration remains a top priority and that the u s continues to lead the world in this field
5832775 its very interesting to see mccain now paint himself as a strong supporter of nasa
5832776 when he could have stepped up to support the program he has not done that he has no general respect forour community
5832777 an overall review early in the administration of where nasas money is spent to determine an appropriate plan of action
5832778 we are pleased the university is pursuing an agreement that would make these records publicly available
5832779 the donors only concerns regarding the collection are due to personnel information that could include names confidential salary information and even social security numbers
5832780 i cant believe the carrot is my favorite thing on this plate
5832781 the second quarter loss would have been even larger without the 12 32 million in investment income from the hmsa reserve
5832782 when trading you are committing your money to something that you have no control over so you have to do it in a way to keep yourself out of trouble you need a system to help you in volatile markets
5832783 toorop has a very strong personal code and i was attracted to that part of his character
5832784 i think too often people have a perception that just because a character acts immorally that they do not actually have a moral compass but that is not the case toorop lives by his own personal codes of conduct but allows the lines to blur in order to get his job done this is a lesson he learned while in the military in the films opening scene you see toorop at the marketplace and he goes from threatening a guy who owes him money at gunpoint to promising to bring a hungry kid food he uses physical force in order to effectuate his professional needs but in his heart he is a generous man
5832785 the many worlds of jonas moore is an exciting digital graphic novel thats creating quite a sensation abroad
5832786 we see this as a great concept that will make an exciting series for worldwide audiences
5832787 mgm is a great place for the many worlds of jonas moore
5832788 there has never been a black british action hero before and what appealed to me was that mgm understood this from the outset jonas moore is sophisticated educated tough and uber cool he represents the next generation of intelligent action heroes of international sci fi drama
5832789 senator obama strongly supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose he believes that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue and he believes that women do not make these decisions casually but wrestle with them in consultation with their doctors pastors and family senator obama understands that some will disagree with him and choose not to support him and he respects those with different opinions but the recent attacks on senator obama that allege he would allow babies born alive to die are outrageous lies the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting there is no room for these kinds of distortions and lies in this campaign what senator obamas attackers dont tell you is that existing illinois law already requires doctors to provide medical care in the very rare case that babies are born alive during abortions they will not tell you that obama voted against these laws in illinois because they were clear attempts to undermine roe v wade they will not tell you that these laws were also opposed by pro choice republicans and the illinois medical society a leading association of doctors in the state and they will not tell you that obama has always maintained that he would have voted for the federal version of this bill which did not pose such a threat the bills senator obama voted against in illinois were crafted to undermine roe v wade or pre existing illinois state law regulating reproductive healthcare and medical practice which is why senator obama objected to them

5832804 where it will lead i dont know but the world would be a better place if everyone talked a little more to each other
5832805 we started working on the movie and it became like a nickname
5832806 we even had another title greyshot the name of the bridge that rob and beth are hiding under in central park at the end of the film which we were all set to announce at comic con but by that time the name cloverfield had already leaked out and the fans already knew it by that name so we just decided to stick with that

5832809 more importantly and with immense strategic implications russia is also trying to send israel a clear message that tel avivs military support for tbilisi in organizing training and equipping georgias army will no longer be tolerated

5832814 everyone assumed that it was done and finished and you know now that we got the notification on friday about it it was like again
5832815 the list includes names of people who have already been set free
5832816 more than 10 days after the armed conflict erupted the icrcs key priority remains gaining safe and unimpeded access to all areas affected by the conflict including south ossetia as well as isolated villages near gori which were cut off by the fighting
5832817 as of 18 august the icrc still has not received the necessary security guarantees from the authorities to gain access to south ossetia
5832818 i do not pin great hopes on your mercy and i do not count on it now
5832819 the only thing you can gain through marauding looting robbing exploding and demolishing is international alienation for many months years and even generations
5832820 spirit of resistance had not been broken and wouldnt be broken
5832821 ive been up since 6 a m going to places to try and find this aid nowhere weve gotten nothing how were we supposed to know this war would come
5832822 the biggest problem is that the occupying forces should leave independent georgia
5832823 if they dont itll be very difficult for the peaceful population here
5832824 we have to establish order so that the stores can open so that we can turn on the gas
5832825 theres no way we can get out all of those people all that equipment in one day
5832826 they created a panic in the population with whom can we speak now
5832827 theres no sign of any change theyre digging trenches theyre not planning on leaving
5832828 they russian forces are just staging it to show foreign journalists as if they are starting pulling out
5832829 i wonder if the list of 80 captives had been prepared beforehand to get on our nerves
5832830 without a doubt the events of the past few days force us to review our relations with them
5832831 in general much will depend on how they behave in the coming hours
5832832 i hope that the august 19 decision by the osce will contribute to the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement and facilitate the prompt opening of humanitarian corridors to assist the civilian population and prepare for a return of refugees and internally displaced persons
5832833 some of the details must still be worked out but the agreed increase in the number of monitors will enable the osce to help stabilize the situation and support international relief efforts
5832834 while todays decision is far from perfect we believe it is of the utmost importance to get additional mmos on the ground as soon as possible
5832835 if the parties to the conflict can accept this language we can too
5832836 when i saw putin speak on russian television his eyes staring into the camera i knew who he was talking to it was saakashvili
5832837 he will not stop until he removes saakashvili from power
5832838 moscow thinks that once georgia is destroyed economically militarily and morally all the anger will be directed against the government but moscow was never really able to read the caucasus
5832839 despite a number of problems georgia deserves freedom and the prospects of democratic development
5832840 georgia and its future are beyond one regime or government
5832841 this is not the time to criticize who did what
5832842 later some questions need to be answered but not now when the entire country is under attack he saakashvili cant step back now
5832843 what was he thinking couldnt he just stay quiet and stop poking putin he can speak about nato all he wants but russian tanks are on georgia soil now people are dying and suffering what did he do to avoid this what did nato do
5832844 there always will be georgians that will say that the georgian government did this and that but thats a beauty of democracy
5832845 hey maybe you could leave some scraps for the rest of us
5832846 before we are dancing at the end of a rope without music
5832847 it is unbelievable how life is so unpredictable and finds a way to distract and derail you from your plans
5832848 we want to make sure that every composition of ours has a good melody
5832849 we want to follow the stalwarts of yester years and be known for our work
5832850 vishal and shekhar are a great combination great music directors i have had wonderful times sitting in their studios in mumbai and choosing the tunes for the unforgettable tour and to see them now perform live has been a great revelation for me
5832851 with its exceptional parts quality heavy duty construction outboard hdmi switching option and balanced xlr input and output connections halo p 7s noise floor is a full 10 db below that of a typical av receiver and you dont achieve performance like that with off the shelf parts our engineering team has worked miracles to keep this level of quality at an affordable price point
5832852 i dont see why the united way has to just give the building away for free when everyone has said theres value in it
5832853 its a 40 year old building thats been maintained by a nonprofit so there is some obvious wear and tear
5832854 paul was the first architect to come forward with a different view of building renovation than all the others weve dealt with
5832855 the vehicle failed shortly after liftoff and in no way reached its intended position it could be characterized as a dramatic failure
5832856 the strait of hormuz is one of 14 locations in the world with unique strategic importance
5832857 oil production and the transportation of oil via the strait of hormuz require regional stability and security if the gulf region becomes unstable this would entail fundamental and grave problems for the export of persian gulf oil
5832858 iran is the largest and strongest independent country in the middle east
5832859 irans response to any kind of military action that jeopardizes its interests will be swift resolute and crushing
5832860 the point emphasized by iran and insisted upon by the irgc which is the strongest armed military force in the persian gulf is that in the event of military action against iran by the enemies i
5832861 in the event of military action by an enemy no one should expect iran to refrain from using every available means of self defense including closing the strait of hormuz with a view to damaging the invaders interests closing the strait of hormuz is part of irans defense policy in face of the u s military threat
5832862 the captors know that in the event of an attack on iran they will be unable to withdraw all their forces from iraq and afghanistan overnight and flee since the pasbandar region up to the delta of the arwand river i e shatt al arab which is considered one of the flanks of the persian gulf as well as part of the gulf of oman is controlled by iran meaning that iran maintains a hold on the enemys vital arteries
5832863 60 of all oil consumed worldwide passes through the persian gulf
5832864 these days although no incident has as yet occurred oil prices have risen from 12 to 120 a barrel now try to calculate how high the price of this essential commodity will rise if the enemy acts in a foolhardy manner compelling iran to defend itself
5832865 if instead of going on foot to karbala in iraq as a pilgrimage pilgrims travel to iraq to fight the americans they will be doing something for the sake of humanity if instead of watching the u s fleet in the persian gulf you prepare yourselves for the day when at supreme leader khameneis slightest signal you will set forth to sink these ships you will have done something for the sake of humanity

5832867 it was like racing a car at max velocity when you hit a curve you either maintain control or you crash and burn
5832868 today i crashed and burned im shocked and sad but im happy for the girls
5832869 i kind of felt like she was me for a minute there
5832870 its heartbreaking because i saw her face afterward i know the feeling i know how she felt
5832871 i dont want to tell you what im thinking right now because its not positive i mean i feel so betrayed by my body once again and its just such a tough break for me
5832872 i kept saying what what i was hoping no one could read my lips
5832873 i couldnt believe i was holding the flag and getting a medal it was amazing
5832874 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5832875 its just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life
5832876 im just going to run my heart out and hope for the best
5832877 god has blessed us with a lovely girl stasha i wanted to spend more time with her now i have my in laws to look after her so i decided to resume acting
5832878 i play pinki himesh reshammiya s sister though the length of my role is not big it is significant to the story
5832879 i have been lucky that i never had to run after people for work i was approached for
5832880 the transition from mac to mobileme was rockier than we had hoped while we are making a lot of improvements the mobileme service is still not up to our standards we are extending subscriptions 60 days free of charge to express appreciation for our members patience as we continue to improve the service
5832881 can run in any number of physical and virtual oses operating system environments within a server farm as long as the number of physical processors being used by running instances of the software at any one time does not exceed the number of licenses assigned to servers in the server farm
5832882 in a time zone that is within four hours of the local time zone of the other
5832883 count the greatest number of physical processors at any time supporting running instances across your server farm and assign that number of licenses
5832884 these instances run on a server farm made up of 20 servers each with four physical processors if just three unique physical processors support the three running instances then based on the licensing changes you need only three sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses so you can run those three instances anywhere in your server farm if however two physical processors support each of the running instances for a total of six unique physical processors in this scenario you would need six sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses without the licensing changes you would need 80 processor licenses to support moving the instances freely in the server farm
5832885 obama has a personal knowledge and interest that is not insignificant
5832886 he made sure he was smart around the issues of global health
5832887 i do not think mccain is indifferent but i do not think he has the same level of personal knowledge or passion
5832888 campaign documents are thin on the subject of global health
5832889 campaign promotes proposals to confront hiv aids globally and has a multiple page list of sweeping reforms in international development
5832890 both candidates support a more collaborative relationship with other countries which could be a boon for global health generally

5832896 lamentablemente en contra de nuestras pol ticas en contra de nuestra buena voluntad nos vemos en la obligaci n de subir nuestro producto estrella
5832897 what we need to be careful about is not playing one marginalized community off the other
5832898 the reality of differences is not going to go away because of one election
5832899 our very claim to be anglican remains in jeopardy and we have yet to clearly respond

5832902 in an urban area air rights are just as much an asset as a piece of property
5832903 are trying to engage in the economic sphere and this is an effort to help them feel comfortable engaging in business
5832904 in islam business is like everything else it is an act of worship if i treat customers fairly ive engaged in an act of worship
5832905 fifteen years ago when i started talking to muslim organizations like mosques about the need to be more efficient and effective people would laugh at me
5832906 whether youre legal or illegal its always been assumed that your medical information is private and cant be used against you
5832907 the doctor patient relationship is sacred and im not sure that has really been challenged until now were in uncharted territory
5832908 any person who lives in our community presents a potential public health risk
5832909 to scare them away could mean that a public health risk goes undetected until it has affected more of us than it should have
5832910 since reports of impotence incidence pathophysiology and treatment have shown a possible link between bph luts and impotence pde5 inhibitors like tadalafil cxxxxx have received increased attention for treating bph luts although they are currently only approved for impotence the half life of tadalafil is 17 5 hours making it suitable as once daily therapy although the precise mechanism of action by which pde5 inhibitors may alleviate luts is not completely understood several putative mechanisms are currently under investigation
5832911 tadalafil administered once daily for lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia a dose finding study
5832912 democratic health care proposals may have gotten more attention during the primaries
5832913 give those without company provided health insurance the same tax advantages as those with coverage through work
5832914 amount of the tax credit will not be enough to purchase comprehensive coverage
5832915 would not subsidize bells and whistles marriage counseling acupuncture etc as the current system does
5832916 question whether individuals especially those with chronic or pre existing medical conditions would be able to find health plans they could afford
5832917 encourage young and healthy workers to forgo company coverage purchasing insurance on their own rather than paying income taxes on the benefit
5832918 would leave employers with only the costly sick workers to insure
5832919 could eventually lead to the death of company provided health plans
5832920 if health benefits became taxable income yes i do think that more people would opt out
5832921 you have to really know what it is youre doing because you can make matters worse at times when you think youre making them better
5832922 thats why i think senator obama has thought this through
5832923 biggest fiscal challenges america will face will emerge not during the next few years but over the next few decades
5832924 most pressing threat to our economic future is not demography but the rapid rise in national health spending
5832925 singling out medicare and medicaid for cuts and leaving seniors and our most vulnerable families to fend for themselves simply is not the answer
5832926 obama plans to implement dramatic reforms to lower the cost of health care in the public and private sectors including investments in health information technology to save administrative costs and improve insurance market competition and preventative care to help people avoid serious and costly illnesses
5832927 mccain will enforce the spending restraint to balance the budget and keep it balanced
5832928 budget will remain in balance over the long term only with crucial bipartisan efforts to reform and protect social security and medicare for future retirees
5832929 a grant from the queensland government was a significant factor in establishing our brisbane presence and a study by kpmg had also recognised the city near the top of the list for it competitiveness brisbane also offers a promising talent pool of quality multi lingual graduates and upstream open source community representatives
5832930 robotics shaped by and shaping the world in 2000 2050
5832931 supporting multi region languages is something a small company cant obtain without spending a lot of money
5832932 i always thought it would be great for all the very talented engineers in the asia pacific region to start growing open source companies
5832933 we didnt have a lot of support we relied on a few computers and free bandwidth we didnt have sales or marketing staff
5832934 to start an open source company you just need to be good at what you do and do good stuff keep costs down it is possible to start extremely small
5832935 if you want people to adopt your software for free you have to make it easy to use
5832936 to occupy the region and steal its oil under the cover of maintaining security there
5832937 what is the meaning of the silence over the horrible russian crimes in chechnya and the lynching of muslims and tearing apart of their bodies what does the humiliation of muslims in somalia and the killing of 13 000 of our brother muslims there mean
5832938 they are determined to continue with their crusader campaigns against our nation to occupy our countries to plunder our resources and to enslave us
5832939 judging by lis recovery so far there should be few problems
5832940 lis smile remains lopsided as the nerves on the right side of his face arent functioning properly but the left side of his face appeared to show his happiness
5832941 we obviously also are sharing information the u s was active in helping in the past with the pkk and we will be active in the future
5832942 in the last few months we have seen their incursions into turkey rising and they are attacking our security forces
5832943 its kind of brazen this kind of poke in the eye by china unicom at china mobile
5832944 the redberry is not afraid neither did david fear goliath
5832945 china unicoms redberry brand not only continues the already familiar blackberry image and name it also fully reflects the symbolic meaning of china unicoms new red corporate logo
5832946 china has its own gestation cycle and you work with it and you respect it
5832947 what kind of remedies available through the system there are
5832948 normally i would not dignify vicious mean spirited mythology masquerading as biography
5832949 but it seems this latest rehash of other unauthorized biographies is getting a lot of attention
5832950 who is the person described in this book from what has been told to me certainly not anyone i know this stereotypic image bears little resemblance to me or anything about me
5832951 karl malden and estelle parsons offered interesting insights as did people who worked with her singers musicians composers
5832952 she made a statement years ago if god wrote my biography i wouldnt like it
5832953 id like people to know that i am a fan of barbras
5832954 the first gift i gave my wife when we were students at uc berkeley in the 1960s was the soundtrack album of funny girl
5832955 i will not dignify any other untruths beside her sisters wedding by responding any further maybe its finally time for an authorized biography
5832956 it was just such a strange scene strange the way her body was laid out strange the way her clothes were arranged
5832957 was in a very strange position her legs were together her arms were by her side
5832958 we want to do something the gentrifiers dont want us to do join together
5832959 tip of the iceberg of discontent on how decisions are made
5832960 one class one race gated community that shuts people out rather than letting them in
5832961 should try to figure out how to work this out
5832962 out of town parishioners are getting greater rights than d c taxpayers
5832963 its a book about big ideas you can love them or you can hate them
5832964 but were all talking about them and thats really the point
5832965 when the galleys came back i sat down and i read the novel start to finish in one sitting and i was really happy really proud of it
5832966 by the way if anybody in the audience would like to sue me we have forms out back
5832967 agons challenge is to ensure that slower growth in western europe doesnt get in the way of an overall good top line result for the company
5832968 since top line results will be harder to go for than in the past agon should bring investors attention to the cost opportunity
5832969 that can supplement a more moderate top line performance so that the companys overall earnings results could still be very attractive
5832970 opportunities for loreal to make meaningfully sized acquisitions without encountering antitrust problems
5832971 keep it in your mind man soviet reactors cannot explode
5832972 i got scared first of all because of my daughter grasped her and ran home i told my wife not to go outside and to close all the windows
5832973 those who walked in this water had the skin peeled from their legs in a week
5832974 the water was coming and coming and nobody knew how to switch the reactor off
5832975 thats what im going to say in my homily today finally your prayers have been answered by god
5832976 we call for an end to the killing of one another and we denounce the violence and fanaticism that threatens life
5832977 in the joyous atmosphere of these days i cannot not recall that many of these peoples in serbia romania and bulgaria are suffering because of the flooding
5832978 china made a huge gamble in 1995 when it decided to appoint its own panchen lama it seems this has failed completely so far
5832979 china has lost a great opportunity to control the selection and training of the next dalai lama
5832980 i dont want to harm or demonize these churches i want these churches to act legally
5832981 you have flagrant intervention continuing and no indication of irs activity
5832982 the irs is interested in enforcing the rules equally against all organizations regardless of whatever political stripe they are political appointees are not at all involved in deciding which cases we are going to do
5832983 whatever happened to buying a couple of kegs inviting over a bunch of coeds and ending up having casual sex
5832984 jon voight is a frightened little girl in a pink ballet tutu who acts like obama just wondered in from the rain forest with a bone through his nose and a communist pamphlet in his loincloth
5832985 do you know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5832986 this suggests that arsenic would play a role in the development of diabetes
5832987 but there clearly needs to be additional research conducted because our study has certain limitations we are conducting those studies now but thats going to take a few years
5832988 this is a good base for future research but its a small sample size and doesnt look at dose response
5832989 in terms of magnitude people in taiwan and bangladesh are exposed to at least 10 times higher levels compared to people in the u s
5832990 we were interested in investigating if arsenic exposure at low and moderate levels could be related to diabetes
5832991 when we adjusted for diabetes risk factors and for markers of seafood intake we found this moderate to strong relationship between arsenic and the prevalence of diabetes
5832992 there are still many americans with arsenic in drinking water at levels above safety standards
5832993 this reinforces how important it is that all drinking water is below this standard the good news is that we can actually do something to eliminate arsenic from water
5832994 medicare web site is somewhat difficult for people to use
5832995 when e health tools are designed designers really have to think about a broad and inclusive group of users and what their needs and abilities are
5832996 we really have to think who we are designing these web sites for what their needs are and what their capabilities are
5832997 we cant assume that everyone has a sophisticated level of computer skills
5832998 without that information we question the usefulness of the study
5832999 cms has worked to organize and format these tools in a consumer friendly manner by conducting both qualitative and quantitative research of the web site tools with multiple audiences
5833000 the information gathered from testing is used to make improvements to the web site our research is ongoing and the web site continues to make enhancements on an incremental basis
5833001 it would be nice to have an administration more committed to people understanding what their rights are
5833002 the administration could provide better quality services with more accuracy
5833003 in fairness its also true that congress and the bush administration has made so much of medicare so complex that even folks with the best of intentions are going to be misdirecting consumers
5833004 its absolutely true that the complexity that president bush has brought to medicare during his two terms in office has been unfortunate
5833005 i tried to hold them off and i just couldnt and im just so disappointed ive never had anything like that happen i was totally out of control on the straightaway i was all over the lane and christine ohuruogu was just really strong coming home
5833006 the hurdles were just coming up too fast and i just couldnt maintain control so i just crashed and burned
5833007 last season i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy
5833008 my hamstring really let me down and i feel like ive worked so hard in vain

5833011 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5833012 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5833013 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5833014 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5833015 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5833016 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5833017 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5833018 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5833019 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5833020 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane

5833023 if the government wants to do something useful hire more rather than less people to be muezzins
5833024 the people who want this want to get rid of loudspeakers altogether so they can get a good sleep after coming home at 4 in the morning
5833025 a hand went inside of me and i felt god was pulling out roots
5833026 i know now that they were the roots of bitterness i forgave my ex husband and i was healed from the abuse
5833027 because latinos both catholic and protestant tend to have strong family values theyre much more morally conservative overall
5833028 but the pentecostals and evangelicals are much more conservative than the catholic latinos are
5833029 both his parents are actually bollywood stars as well so he s bollywood royalty so its kind of like his birthright
5833030 he has all these fans and people go wild over him but when he s around the love of his life who plays the choreographer of the movie he doesn t know what to do with himself so he acts foolish
5833031 colorado is ground zero in terms of whos going to be the next president of the united states
5833032 after being promoted by michael corleone to don of new york players expand to new cities as they build up their families through extorting businesses monopolizing illegal crime rings and defeating new families in an effort to become the most powerful mob family in america
5833033 we found that shorter slimmer females with long slender legs a curvy figure and larger breasts are more attractive
5833034 the improvement signals that fear about an economic downturn among financial market experts is contained the recent fall in the price of oil and the weakening of the euro against the dollar must have dampened concerns about the economy
5833035 market experts have not been particularly taken aback by the negative growth rate of the second quarter they expect weaker but all in all solid economic conditions and do not fear a recession
5833036 the rise did not offset last months fall and the still deeply negative level means that many more investors expect the economy to deteriorate in the next six months than think that it will improve
5833037 both oil and the euro have only simply corrected their sharp advance of recent months and both have made strong gains year on year i e they are still a strain on the economy
5833038 easing pressure from oil and the euro will probably not be sufficient in themselves to trigger a renewed upswing
5833039 it has become crystal clear that markedly slower growth lies ahead as the negative momentum from the global economy is increasingly carrying over into germany
5833040 the euro dollar exchange rate and the oil price might dampen the slowdown but certainly cannot prevent it
5833041 i do not believe that the dollar is going to come back to levels where we can really celebrate
5833042 did not answer my question instead asking me if i was on the team or not afraid that i might lose my job if i refused i replied yes i was part of the team and agreed to write the check
5833043 its the campaigns policy that all contributions comply fully with fec regulations
5833044 no one in the campaign advised anyone to make improper donations that is an issue between those businesses and their employees
5833045 reprisals to coerce them to make campaign donations making contributions in the name of another and making corporate contributions

5833062 todos tenemos la misma sangre egipcia y si el motivo de la medida es prohibir el tr fico de rganos lo rechazamos porque puede ocurrir tambi n entre fieles de la misma religi n
5833063 tenemos miedo a que en el futuro haya hospitales para cristianos y otros para musulmanes

5833070 we could have used a little but we didnt need a gullywasher
5833071 the ground is so hard here because were in a drought and when the rain came down so fast it just flooded
5833072 were creating an ambiance a point of relaxation a meeting place
5833073 they started in los angeles and flourished there for a reason
5833074 because l a is all about image and hype and being seen being seen doing things that are cool people see a photo of paris eating pinkberry and they want it
5833075 the question is are you going to just be a niche player or will you be a national chain
5833076 they clearly are getting a nice buzz within the population but we often mistake our willingness to try new things as a trend
5833077 were not out there trying to get people to endorse pinkberry
5833078 it has been a natural phenomenon were focused on building the right infrastructure growing in other regions and building a fantastic company
5833079 theres always a window of opportunity they are hot for a couple years and die down everything is cyclical

5833084 i recognize that this news will be difficult for many members of our community
5833085 there are inevitable feelings of sadness disbelief and anger which are the same emotions i have been struggling with since first learning of the accusation
5833086 father orr consistently denied the charges and we were disappointed in the results reached by the province review board
5833087 it seems in our best interest not to elaborate on these details
5833088 mostly were hoping to gather women in roughly the same timezone together
5833089 and wed also like to make sure the most active volunteers from both chapters are in regular contact as we have one major joint event each year the linuxchix miniconference at linux conf au and members of each chapter not infrequently visit the other country on business
5833090 im very pleased with the increased numbers of women in open source in recent years and with them has come an increased sense of women in open source being a normal thing
5833091 i hope more linux and open source women users are welcomed into the development and advocacy communities it is also an increasingly good source of it skills and employment and i want more women to take advantage of that

5833094 drivers need to make better decisions about their fitness to drive whether it be refraining from driving when emotionally charged or consciously taking a break when fatigue sets in
5833095 the lifestyles of working professionals stay at home parents and even secondary and tertiary students is such that when they get in their car they have a tendency to go into auto pilot leaving them free to focus on everything else that is happening in their lives when they should be thinking about their driving
5833096 getting safely from a to b must be the priority for drivers from the time they turn on the ignition to the time they turn it off
5833097 these condition are expected to lead to higher levels of virus activity and greater exposure of humans to the viruses
5833098 however australia has a number of other viral pathogens with the potential to threaten the safety of the blood supply such as the ross river barmah forrest kunjin japanese encephalitis murray valley encephalitis and dengue viruses
5833099 the risk of emergence of transfusion transmissible infectious diseases emphasises the need for countries to work together to help each other maintain their blood supplies during epidemics and pandemics
5833100 we hear so much doom and gloom that the more computer games young people play the more stupid violent and anti social they become
5833101 yes playing violent computer games all day long can trick the brain into thinking it has to respond and make someone become more violent
5833102 but playing smarter computer games can actually help modify our abilities in problem solving visual attention working memory forming and modifying strategies even creativity
5833103 all this happens in the space of a fraction of a second and is repeated over and over again
5833104 scratch the surface and these two environments look very similar
5833105 the impact comes from the way we use the technology and how that interacts with each individuals existing characteristics and predispositions
5833106 if we can make the brain adapt to violence then we can make it adapt to all sorts of experiences and positive ones at that
5833107 a week ago she was prepared to give pay raises to city officials this week shes trying to take them to the woodshed it makes no sense and it undermines morale at city hall

5833114 inflation is way too hot and with housing way too cold we have the opposite of a goldilocks economy
5833115 new building codes enacted by new york city accounted for the big jump in permits and starts in june julys 23 6 percent drop in multi family starts and 32 4 percent drop in multi family building permits is mostly payback for junes strong numbers

5833127 its crystal clear that the current spike in gas prices is at least partly due to an act of greed

5833129 taxpayers dont need to be paying for certain of these expenses on behalf of the energy companies
5833130 what happened to iraq oil mr president you said iraqi oil would pay for the war aint seen no money aint seen no oil
5833131 social networking sites such as facebook are a fast growing phenomenon
5833132 social network users need to realise that the information and photos they put into cyberspace in some cases can be seen by others and can leave a digital tattoo that can be difficult to erase
5833133 the latest research from the us suggests 44 per cent of employers are now using sites like myspace and facebook to research job candidates
5833134 as a general rule its best not to publish information you would not want the world to know
5833135 simple solution is to return the device to the store provider from which it was purchased and demand repair or replacement
5833136 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model

5833144 the money is available the problem is getting it here
5833145 we hope to find a solution in the near future
5833146 we hope that the banks that dont deal with the united states will transfer this money for us
5833147 if you take harsh measures we will hide this program if you use the language of force you should not expect us to act transparently
5833148 have to understand they cannot resolve this issue through force
5833149 iranians can threaten but they are deepening their own isolation
5833150 irans nuclear capability is one example of various scientific capabilities in the country the islamic republic of iran is prepared to transfer the experience knowledge and technology of its scientists

5833185 too much good news is not good news because the market worries about the fed
5833186 we took the letter opener and inserted it it was a perfect fit
5833187 twenty four years later you could still see the stab wounds
5833188 as a matter of political principal china always has difficulties with regard to sanctions
5833189 so therefore china will never use sanctions nor we will accept any sanctions imposed on china
5833190 the councils reputation is at stake and we believe this will actually help the abuja process to demonstrate that impunity cannot be allowed to continue

5833195 i love you all but youre all fuc ing mad
5833196 cemexs production capacity is like that of lafarge and holcim together
5833197 as a government we respect the decision of venezuelan authorities but we must also watch over the interests of our companies we think that cemex was discriminated against and we do not understand why
5833198 two consecutive elevated readings on core consumer prices combined with todays worrisome report on producer prices will be hard for the fed to overlook at its next meeting
5833199 that said recent and further evidence of significant economic weakness makes it unlikely for the fed to push up interest rates this year
5833200 inflation is more systemic than they were leading us to believe in the past numbers and it will continue to show up in the cpi number for months to come the question is whether or not investors can shake it off knowing that the price of oil has come down
5833201 the fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place and it shows
5833202 the u s economy is growing and showing great flexibility but we are in a period of slow growth
5833203 when the housing sector returns we expect broader economic activity to return as well
5833204 i am concerned that you are being manipulated by russia
5833205 there is no legal ground to demand his resignation but there is moral ground
5833206 this has gone through with west brom and we are very pleased

5833210 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
5833211 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past
5833212 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
5833213 no one should be afraid of this if they have good intentions towards us or the rest of the west
5833214 probably over the last five years there have been at least five occasions when it was alleged that canada and the united states were close to a deal on softwood lumber i can tell you that being close doesnt count
5833215 for at least the eastern canadian forestry sector and possibly the entire c 81 billion canadian industry the recent return to the negotiating table is an ominous sign that a deal at any cost is in the works
5833216 what we now know is that our government may be considering a deal that will harm the industry in ontario and accelerate the already ominous list of closures and job losses

5833221 getting safely from a to b must be the priority for drivers from the time they turn on the ignition to the time they turn it off
5833222 this sort of willingness to get behind the wheel when all the signs say you shouldnt suggests some drivers are either ignorant of the law or just plain stupid

5833248 suffering is either meaningful or not either redemptive or simply unpleasant
5833249 alleviating poverty is a kind of anti suffering policy i can get on board with not all suffering is sacrificial redemptive awesome
5833250 that the only way they can think to respond to suffering is to want it stopped as soon as possible
5833251 if it should come to the last extremity my party is taken i would take my fate with the poor and low and feeble

5833255 esto es lo que dije que iba a hacer me puse mi meta y me entren duro s lo junt las piezas y realmente cre en mi mismo y lo hice
5833256 the thought of the us air force on its way would have deterred even vladimir putin
5833257 demands full and immediate compliance with the cease fire agreement to which the parties have subscribed
5833258 demands the immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities and the return of georgian forces to their usual bases
5833259 the high commissioner will again press for the protection of the civilian population especially those newly displaced and for safe and unhindered access by humanitarian organizations to the areas of displacement
5833260 i hope the international community will show itself fully ready capable and willing to help provide critically needed assistance to the people of georgia
5833261 while the most acute phase of the violence appears to have passed until there a firm peace in the country we must be prepared to respond to a critical and fluctuating humanitarian situation
5833262 the later he does that the less time the republicans have to start picking on that person whoever it is
5833263 you can tell that theres disagreement in that campaign about what the vision of the campaign really is
5833264 i think he answers that question that people have in terms of experience in general because of his long tenure as a senator
5833265 i think its mostly because we have become much more homogenous as a nation
5833266 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
5833267 unfortunately he was simply not up to the challenges of running this agency
5833268 in the last five years we have seen the complete and utter abandonment of our small businesses courtesy of the bush administration
5833269 to working with hectors successor who i hope will be someone who has a deep commitment to the success of small businesses and understands the vital role the sba plays in that success
5833270 learned to do more with less while facing unparalleled challenges
5833271 it has been a unique honor to help execute your vision to bring unprecedented opportunities to all entrepreneurs in every community as they seek to realize their dreams i am proud that the agency has delivered strong results and achieved historical milestones on behalf of a vital component of our great economy americas small businesses
5833272 as europe has done the united states must finally accept to limit their subsidies which are distorting global trade
5833273 we must be very vigilant because agriculture cannot be treated only for the benefit of big exporting countries but must also take into account the interests of developing countries and the worlds food safety
5833274 all the good results are coming toward us so my nation do not give up dont be lazy
5833275 become a liar to your own people you claim that everything is under control and it appears afterward that you are lying
5833276 any government in iraq whatever it is will be like a dagger in the heart of the muslim nation
5833277 now they have seen that the government has broken the deadlock
5833278 they are feeling this might be the last chance they have to survive they the insurgents are fighting everyone in iraq every iraqi i think that shows how weak they are

5833385 i look at the stanford dual as a great opportunity to get our kids in the water early against one of the best teams in the country and measure what we have
5833386 well take a preseason mentality into the dual as we will have only had two weeks of practice prior to the dual with the team while other teams open later in the season this will give us a good chance to evaluate our new athletes in a meet situation so we can get a jump on improving our athletes
5833387 our schedule is built with a wide range of teams throughout the season and everything is in place to build our swimmers up to the championship
5833388 we are a championship meet focused team with the dual meets not defining our season but as a means to make sure we are there at the end
5833389 what am i doing here why am i doing this
5833390 i work and then folks pay me money for the work i do then i take the money and pay for things i want
5833391 i dont see what the big deal is theyre right there
5833392 the preparations for the swearing in of members of the seventh parliament since independence are at an advanced stage
5833393 its a sense of sadness because after every game last year and after the first two preseason games i had to look at mr blank and know that he deserves a winning team and he deserves a championship
5833394 i was here and couldnt make it happen its kind of sad for me leaving
5833395 now were calling these teams and kind of narrowing the scope
5833396 joe has been so productive somebody like joe and a team with a need should be a perfect fit
5833397 it was just mentally wearing him down more than physically
5833398 im disappointed that joe didnt get an opportunity to compete because of his injury in training camp and his choice not to come to otas
5833399 we really didnt get an opportunity for him to compete were going to move forward we feel very comfortable about the receiving corps that we have i wish joe the best of luck as he moves on
5833400 we couldnt change something we couldnt control the petrino thing imploded on us it wasnt the falcons fault and it wasnt joes fault it just all fell apart he planned on retiring with atlanta

5833403 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that

5833405 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
5833406 it was one of the most happening places culturally in the country
5833407 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the center of it
5833408 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
5833409 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
5833410 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore
5833411 i think its going to be fun and it really really feels good to be doing it again

5833432 our issue has not been lack of effort it has been lack of talent
5833433 this is pro basketball and good coaching and gutty performances can only take a team so far the mystics need athletes and we need scorers and we need a roster of young ladies whose collective physical skills make other teams in the league dread the thought of playing us
5833434 the mystics have been operating for too long without a long term plan
5833435 in the three years that i have been an owner and a general partner our thinking has been far too shortsighted and our player personnel decisions are far too needs based that all ends today

5833508 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore
5833509 recruitment development and retention of information professionals trends in human resources and knowledge management
5833510 i believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman
5833511 union a union between man and woman between one man and one woman thats my definition of marriage
5833512 are we going to get back to the importance of supreme court justices
5833513 i believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman
5833514 for me as a christian its also a sacred union gods in the mix but uh
5833515 i strongly support preserving the unique status of marriage between man and woman
5833516 im a federalist i believe that the state should make those decisions
5833517 that doesnt mean that they dont have the rights of all citizens im not saying that i am saying that we should preserve the unique status of marriage between one man and one woman and if a federal court decided that my state of arizona had to observe what the state of massachusetts decided then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the state should make the decisions within their own states
5833518 because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution its been a matter of state law that has been our tradition
5833519 the reason people think there needs to be a constitutional amendment is some people believe is because of the concern about same sex marriage i am not somebody who promotes same sex marriage but i do believe in civil unions i do believe that for gay partners to want to visit each other in the hospital for state to say you know what thats alright i dont think in any way inhibits my core beliefs about what marriage is i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective or different view
5833520 strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of the constitution
5833521 proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench
5833522 but when it comes to the programs that are federally funded
5833523 we do have to be careful to make sure we are not creating a situation where people are being discriminated against using federal money
5833524 obama said he believes local laws in some states prohibiting discrimination against gays would apply to faith based social programs funded with federal money in those states
5833525 if you look at what most people have on their ipods its not restricted to one genre of music or just a collection of 50 or 100 songs
5833526 i dont think you should expect anything less from your radio station
5833527 as a public broadcaster our reason for being is to reflect canada to canadians and to reach canadians
5833528 a diversified audience listening to a diversified range of music
5833529 to make it fun and accessible and smart because classical music is all those things
5833530 if i was face to face to a naysayer i would say seriously i can understand youre upset but would you have this radio station 100 per cent dominated by classical and say to someone like ron sexsmith you do not deserve to be played on the radio at all i dont believe that anyone would really feel that way
5833531 commercial heavy super slick overly produced radio with off colour jokes and obnoxious this that and sound effects
5833532 i think its only going to take a few days on the air for a lot of those people to say i was imagining something really bad and this is actually really great and not what i was afraid of at all
5833533 i dont think its going to take long for people to really get behind what were doing

5833602 the truth that we gain from the scriptures is wide ranging the treasure is multi faceted and the reward is incalculable
5833603 we love the scriptures because they lead us to christ we are assiduous in our reading of gods word because therein we see the beauty of god revealed in his son therein we taste the soul satisfying sweetness of his redemptive blessings therein we experience the sin slaying power of his indwelling presence in him says paul are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge col 2 3 he is our exceeding great reward oh what an excellent attainment there is in a thorough knowledge of divine truth

5833609 no es normal que un equipo que quiere ser protagonista tenga suspendidos hemos hablado con los jugadores para decirles que si queremos lograr algo no podemos tener m s errores ya que lo que viene se nos puede hacer cuesta arriba
5833610 sabemos que los jugadores pueden disputar un gran partido o crear situaciones con 11 en un partido pero te digo que a pesar de las expulsiones el equipo siempre trat de reaccionar ante las dificultades esperamos no tener m s expulsiones ya que este equipo intentar jugar y no golpear esas cosas las debemos de corregir
5833611 es una ventaja que estamos dando debido a todas estas dificultades ya que todav a no podemos definir el cuadro base ojal que de aqu en adelante podamos recuperar a todos y no sufrir de bajas que me toque elegir a los mejores para jugar que pueda tener el grupo completo para que sea competitivo y as pelear hasta el final
5833612 me parece que el equipo necesita tiempo y trabajo pero s creo que hemos mejorado mucho en el aspecto t ctico en conocer a los jugadores c mo trabajan me parece que su desempe o mejora me gustar a jugar en el futuro como en los ltimos minutos ante pachuca en los cuales existi el orden t cticamente me gustar a que se mantenga 90 minutos ese protagonismo y vamos a intentar que as sea queremos jugar mejor de lo que estamos haci ndolo

5833615 i was fresh off three big checks from wayne and the album release and i was feeling myself and they came waving very very short dollars
5833616 not saying that there arent dope cats who dont charge but they didnt have access to them
5833617 the fans wanted the album bad and all the shit i had in the pipeline was months away so i needed something to keep my name out
5833618 i had already fucked off the whole joint and the official sony release is still months away too so i had to have something new hit the streets i had other hot weezy shit i couldve leaked out but i figured id hold on to that and do a clipse joint because i had already been mentioning it in press and i had to make good on my word
5833619 he knew it would be a great look and a super lead up to my joint on the clipse album
5833620 but i admit i dropped the ball caught up in the weezy hype i had heat and full creative control but i allowed the business to get in the way of my art itll never happen again though
5833621 its a blank slate that they can accept on their own terms

5833631 he was critical of the salwa judum and the lack of health care at a very basic level so he was a dangerous person because he asked the wrong questions at the most you could say he was foolish why did he meet sanyal but he believed that in a democratic country he could visit anyone in prison he stood up for his convictions that was the extent of his crime

5833674 the effect of adopting a renewable portfolio standard has been to raise electricity prices and push manufacturing into states or other countries with lower electricity prices therefore the effect of a federal rps would be to require states with low electricity prices and proportionately lower renewable energy potential such as is found in our industrial heartland to raise electricity prices to a level that would force their industries to migrate overseas to countries with cheaper energy rates and no renewable portfolio standards

5833709 one of the things i keep coming back to is shinrans off hand comment that he wants to be reborn in hell because the people in hell are the ones who suffer the most the ones most in need of the dharma
5833710 i have never said the nembutsu even once for the repost of my departed father and mother for all sentient beings without exception have been our parents and brothers and sisters in the course of countless lives in many sates of existence on attaining buddhahood after this present life we can save every one of them
5833711 when we quickly attain enlightenment in the pure land we will be able to save by means of transcendent powers first those with whom we have close karmic relations our parents whatever karmic suffering they may have sunk to in the six realms through the four modes of birth
5833712 this is not to say that murders and rapists and thieves are
5833713 this is how we should live our lives and practice
5833714 as long as there is one murderer in the world were all murderers
5833715 the child molester can change and become a saint and that part of the bodhisattva path is to help him do just that
5833716 i give you every seed bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it they will be yours for food
5833717 i heard students whisper to one another before answering my questions initially i thought they were nervous and were having difficulty with my american accent i soon became annoyed with this practice however especially with some of the younger groups who sounded more like a cacophony of locusts than students speaking english but what surprised me the most were the teachers whenever the class became silent with one of my questions their teacher would lean towards the nearest studnt from her seat in the back corner and whisper an answer sometimes voicing it loud enough for others to hear including me
5833718 it is an important part of our schooling without it our class would not be able to get our work done you know the teachers can give us a mark every day so we must be ready for every class and there is too much homework we have to help each other
5833719 it is important to help my friends more important than helping myself
5833720 students and teachers alike have admitted to me that prompting is necessary to help the poorer students in liubas case it enabled her to get through her english classes as the camaraderie of the collective ensured that she belonged and would get by
5833721 prompting is as much a part of soviet classrooms as the uniforms
5833722 with great pride students who knew me well told me about different forms of cheating
5833723 zoyas conention that cheating was not a problem if the teacher looked the other way
5833724 the teachers pretend to teach and the students pretend to learn
5833725 prompting and cheating provide knowledge for those who need it

5833735 is incorrect because only are based on mathematical models and presented results at scenarios that do not include for example solar activity
5833736 so that in two years or so there will be a small ice age that lasts from 60 to 80 years
5833737 summer heat continues in short supply continuing a trend that has dominated much of the 21st centurys opening decade
5833738 there have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at midway airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 thats by far the fewest 90 degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930
5833739 the suns surface has been fairly blank for the last couple of years and that has some worried that it may be entering another maunder minimum the suns 50 year abstinence from sunspots which some scientists have linked to the little ice age of the 17th century
5833740 based on the past armagh measurements this suggests that over the next two decades global temperatures may fall by about 2 degrees c that is to a level lower than any we have seen in the last 100 years
5833741 were actually projecting this year that the north pole may be free of ice for the first time in history
5833742 this summers forecast and unusual early melting events all around the arctic serve as a dire warning of how quickly the polar regions are being affected by climate change
5833743 if norways average temperature this year equals that in 2007 the ice cap in the arctic will all melt away which is highly possible judging from current conditions
5833744 the arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by nsidc and the norwegian polar year secretariat it didnt even come close additionally some current graphs and press releases from nsidc seem less than conservative there appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to arctic ice loss

5833752 and here a womans shoes she was a victim of the militia we found her corpse in the grave
5833753 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
5833754 spies you will dig your own graves long live the mehdi army
5833755 we found this chain on an old mans corpse that we dug out of the grave
5833756 we recovered his corpse completely rotten his hands and legs were amputated and his head was decapitated
5833757 their families are in the district the day before yesterday at noon they tried to assassinate me but i was able to call the police for help
5833758 they said they were just taking him for a few minutes for an investigation
5833759 but they never released him and we heard he might be buried behind the mosque
5833760 as an atheist youre part of a minority whose beliefs are constantly ignored and marginalised while religious prejudice is pandered to and encouraged and you have every right to be offended by that
5833761 the invisible and the non existent look very much alike
5833762 i just believe in one fewer god than you do when you understand why you dismiss all the other gods you will understand why i dismiss yours
5833763 its an incredible con job when you think about it to believe something now in exchange for something after death
5833764 it is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion however satisfying and reassuring
5833765 religious wars are basically people killing each other over who has the better imaginary friend
5833766 the fruits of christianity were religious wars butcheries crusades inquisitions extermination of the natives of america and the introduction of african slaves in their place
5833767 just because science so far has failed to explain something such as consciousness to say it follows that the facile pathetic explanations which religion has produced somehow by default must win the argument is really quite ridiculous
5833768 to explain the unknown by the known is a logical procedure to explain the known by the unknown if a form of theological lunacy
5833769 we would be 1 500 years ahead if it hadnt been for the church dragging science back by its coattails and burning our best minds at the stake
5833770 the church has opposed every innovation and discovery from the day of galileo down to our own time when the use of anesthetic in childbirth was regarded as a sin because it avoided the biblical curse pronounced against eve and every step in astronomy and geology ever taken has been opposed by bigotry and superstition the greeks surpassed us in artistic culture and in architecture five hundred years before christian religion was born
5833771 the christian mythologists tell us that christ died for the sins of the world and that he came on purpose to die would it not then have been the same if he had died of a fever or of the small pox of old age or of anything else

5833791 saya masih ingat ketika terry dan ferdinand saat menjadi kapten mereka bermain sangat bagus maka tak mudah bagi saya untuk memilih kapten keduanya sama sama pemain bagus saya kira kepribadian besar yang membuat terry saya pilih tapi ferdinand juga sangat penting dalam tim maka saya pilih sebagai kapten kedua
5833792 posisi kapten sangat penting karena dialah yang mengarahkan tim sementara kompetisi sudah hampir dimulai untuk timnas kualifikasi piala dunia akan menjadi musim kompetisi yang penting maka kami harus segera memutuskan kaptennya sekarang kami harus bertanding di setiap partai seperti final

5833797 we had probably our best practice of the year so far
5833798 on crude trend line support is holding and the dollar is exhausted and falling
5833799 to bounce back the way i did after that huge disappointment showed what kind of person i am maybe that persuaded him
5833800 i dont know if it did but it was a big boost to get the captains armband against the united states
5833801 i went on the pitch played well and scored the goal it helped to relieve the pressure a small amount for me and now i just want to get on with the job
5833802 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour and a fabulous achievement
5833803 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5833804 i had heard whispers that rio had got it so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it
5833805 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5833806 but the captain is very important because he is the driver of the team rio is very important but i chose john because of his big personality
5833807 lets not talk about winning the world cup we just want to qualify
5833808 the situation has been very difficult the conflict between georgia and russia has made it so
5833809 we have had problems getting our players out our kit and our staff
5833810 now we aim for a good result with the right spirit and motivation
5833811 but the conflict has been very negative it has been impossible to forget things that have been happening
5833812 this is the first contact i have had with my new players we needed to train and play this match
5833813 after this we have our first world cup qualifier in september against the irish we are working together here and that is important for us in the future
5833814 we hope that game can be played in tbilisi but we will have to wait for a decision on that
5833815 we have to put in maximum effort to have the respect of the georgian people for what they have been through
5833816 they are looking for a good and positive result and we will be doing our best for them
5833817 i will do my best now to lead this team to the world cup finals what has happened to georgia has made me even more determined to work for them
5833818 the georgian people and the georgian nation deserve that and i will do all i can to make it happen
5833819 the russians did not believe we could get 18 players out of the country for this game but we have done it
5833820 we had to spend 20 hours on a bus very dangerous going to baku the capital of azerbaijan for our visas
5833821 i am happy that i have come to play for a major club like olympiakos i will do my best to satisfy the clubs administration and supporters
5833822 i am not worried you have to give them time he is 19 years old
5833823 theo is not yet completely there collectively but he can make decisions in big games that will always be his strength
5833824 he is a boy who will always make progress because he is intelligent and he knows where he wants to get and that is why i believe you have to patient with him
5833825 i believe that when everyone is sharp we will have much more invention
5833826 but of course you always want a player like fabregas to be in there because he gives you the quality of the pass
5833827 i would never blame individuals for the team not lifting a trophy we are in it together we win as a team and we lose as a team
5833828 as individuals we all make mistakes and the message i was relaying to a czech newspaper was that we are more experienced now and have learnt from last season
5833829 we came so close last year to winning something and we will be giving it our all to win a trophy this year
5833830 the uncertainty with regard to financials has kept the downward pressure on
5833831 home prices keep falling assets continue to deteriorate the economy continues to slow which can only worsen the unemployment rate and increase delinquencies
5833832 theres seemingly no end to this cycle and thats to the detriment of any financial stock

5833834 consumers are not likely to make very large ticket purchases when prospects in the labor market are weakening and confidence remains very low

5833836 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
5833837 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
5833838 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
5833839 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
5833840 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
5833841 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
5833842 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
5833843 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
5833844 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
5833845 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
5833846 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
5833847 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
5833848 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
5833849 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
5833850 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
5833851 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
5833852 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
5833853 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
5833854 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
5833855 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
5833856 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
5833857 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
5833858 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
5833859 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
5833860 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
5833861 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
5833862 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
5833863 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
5833864 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
5833865 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
5833866 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

5833869 i never came upon any of my discoveries through the process of rational thinking
5833870 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5833871 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5833872 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5833873 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now

5833876 while governments and the police can discourage speeding and drink driving through education and enforcement its impossible to legislate against absent mindedness
5833877 drivers need to make better decisions about their fitness to drive whether it be refraining from driving when emotionally charged or consciously taking a break when fatigue sets in
5833878 the lifestyles of working professionals stay at home parents and even secondary and tertiary students is such that when they get in their car they have a tendency to go into auto pilot leaving them free to focus on everything else that is happening in their lives when they should be thinking about their driving
5833879 getting safely from a to b must be the priority for drivers from the time they turn on the ignition to the time they turn it off
5833880 these condition are expected to lead to higher levels of virus activity and greater exposure of humans to the viruses
5833881 however australia has a number of other viral pathogens with the potential to threaten the safety of the blood supply such as the ross river barmah forrest kunjin japanese encephalitis murray valley encephalitis and dengue viruses
5833882 the risk of emergence of transfusion transmissible infectious diseases emphasises the need for countries to work together to help each other maintain their blood supplies during epidemics and pandemics
5833883 we hear so much doom and gloom that the more computer games young people play the more stupid violent and anti social they become
5833884 yes playing violent computer games all day long can trick the brain into thinking it has to respond and make someone become more violent
5833885 but playing smarter computer games can actually help modify our abilities in problem solving visual attention working memory forming and modifying strategies even creativity
5833886 all this happens in the space of a fraction of a second and is repeated over and over again
5833887 scratch the surface and these two environments look very similar
5833888 the impact comes from the way we use the technology and how that interacts with each individuals existing characteristics and predispositions
5833889 if we can make the brain adapt to violence then we can make it adapt to all sorts of experiences and positive ones at that
5833890 mccain came roaring out of the gate from the first question and was a commanding figure throughout the night as he spoke directly and often movingly about his past and the countrys future by contrast obama was often searching for words and while far more thoughtful was also less emotionally connective with his audience
5833891 the stasi had complete control over who was phone tapped and and who was investigated at any given time
5833892 speaking before the veterans of foreign wars this morning barack obama delivered an amazing show of chutzpah of course if obama were to accuse mccain of picking his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition everyone would laugh because it obviously is not true by contrast there is quite a bit of evidence that obama has placed political expediency above national security
5833893 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
5833894 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
5833895 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
5833896 we need to start drilling offshore on advanced oil rigs like this one
5833897 new drilling has got to be part of our energy solution
5833898 when im president there will be a whole lot more like them not only here in the gulf but also off of our east and west coasts
5833899 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now

5833903 increase with age with an overall prevalence of greater than 50 in men 50 years or older
5833904 all integers x such that x is both even and prime
5833905 actually a predicate if it is then when it is applied to a subject it must produce a statement which can be classified as true or false lets leave the subjective nature of taste aside for a moment thats not the fundamental logical problem here
5833906 a predicate of course not that utterance doesnt make any sense tastes more like what this utterance
5833907 that is they want to make the claim that the product has improved without making the admission that the previous formulation was less than delicious
5833908 diet dr pepper tastes more like regular dr pepper than diet coke tastes like regular coke
5833909 that is they want to assert that their product is superior to a competing product
5833910 as it happens this predicate was true for technology x
5833911 that predicate happens to be utterly false for technology x because he was not actually stating a predicate that could be true or false of x i was unable to answer the guys question about x
5833912 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
5833913 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
5833914 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss
5833915 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it
5833916 the lhc is a discovery machine we dont know what well find
5833917 im actually hoping we find something unexpected that does the job of the higgs
5833918 weve been debating this for 30 years and one way or another the lhc will definitively tell us how electroweak symmetry breaking occurs thats a fundamental advance
5833919 its a tough game you can only do it by statistical analysis since there are other known processes that produce events that can mimic a higgs boson signal
5833920 by itself the higgs is a very puzzling particle so there have been a lot of conjectures about some kind of new physics beyond the standard model supersymmetry has the easiest time fitting in with what we know
5833921 initially well be looking for things that are known standards to make sure that everything is working properly in 2009 we could start really looking for new things like supersymmetry
5833922 these large projects take such a long time we have to start early
5833923 weve been operating it and looking at cosmic ray particles
5833924 nature gives us these cosmic rays for free and theyre the same kinds of particles well see when the machine turns on so it enables us to check out certain aspects of the detector but were very excited to start seeing collisions from the machine
5833925 well be throwing away a lot of data so we have to make sure the triggers are working correctly
5833926 the graduate students and postdocs get to go to geneva but even the undergraduates get a chance to work in a real physics lab and be part of a major international experiment
5833927 there is a high level of interaction and camaraderie between theorists and experimentalists at ucsc which is not the case at other leading institutions
5833928 for me its valuable just in terms of being aware of whats happening on the experimental side
5833929 if nothing were found beyond what we know today that would be so radical because it would be in violation of a lot of extremely fundamental principles
5833930 we are excited to raise the audio post bar in burbank and create a dynamic atmosphere to enhance the client experience
5833931 weve upgraded the studios and as a result people in hollywood in burbank and all over the valley are realizing theres a place they can go that treats audio clients as first class clients
5833932 everything was designed with audio and television and film in mind
5833933 we do foreign language dubbing we do adr for features here
5833934 we do independents commercial films tv series but as far i know not too many studios really have that kind of global reach because we have those offices all over europe and theyre very significant over there as well and now were in the heart of the entertainment capital too with burbank
5833935 our mission is to consistently exceed the expectations of our creative community by providing premium tools technology and environment these state of the art stages help us achieve that
5833936 but we had to redo everything laughs mainly on the stage i changed most of the disposition of the floor the walls and everything for the acoustic purpose
5833937 i want to make sure if we have an issue in one place and we have no time or there is something coming up we can switch studios and use the same setup and the same plug ins to do whatever we need to do
5833938 the latest version is very stable and working very nicely
5833939 we can have security with two sessions we also use their talkback system which allows us to use the regular talkback so the directors here feel really comfortable its like the person is here actually and we set up a camera system with computers to be able also to have a visual of whats happening in the other place
5833940 in burbank and hollywood a lot of celebrities need to do some sort of voice over adr or something and source connect allows us to connect to studios in chicago new york or anywhere around the world its a seamless operation for the client we set it up we record it or it can be recorded elsewhere and its studio quality its part of our mission to make things easy for the clients and the celebrities
5833941 its a nice market and we were the first in europe who have the creative and the technical built in the same company
5833942 so it was very successful over there we thought it was a good idea to put together a studio in l a where all our clients are and thats where my brother phillipe built this building we have 20 years of experience in the business of foreign language dubbing and by coming here we bring our knowledge of how to do things overseas
5833943 we knew however that we could improve the power to weight ratio with several select modifications lamborghini has its gallardo superleggera ferrari its f430 scuderia and dodge its viper acr now the corvette z06 has the clubsport package from katech performance
5833944 reluctant to speak out on these issues as if somehow they had handed over their competence in these areas to the responsible bishops and his particular committee
5833945 i must register too my disappointment that our bishops conference recently could not agree a collegial response to the governments legislation on same sex adoption
5833946 flat and safe at a time when we need passionate and courageous public statements that dare to speak the full truth in love
5833947 our strategy begins with stationing our officers overseas and we have over 200 customs and border protection officers around the world in 58 of the largest seaports
5833948 lets start a dancy band tour right away add millions to our myspace thatll be fun
5833949 this code does not limit the authority of city county or city and county governments to make necessary changes to the provisions contained in this code
5833950 its mediation chris you just need to stop playing so much yknow just get out some and get some sunlight thats all im saying im worried about you man
5833951 los nidos de las hormigas cortadoras de hojas pueden albergar una casa de tres pisos hay una leyenda rural que dice que los tractores pueden desaparecer dentro de ellas
5833952 mi idea fue intentar obtener una imagen de la colonia de hormigas que permitiera que las hormigas permanecieran all y que despu s pudiera ser distribuida

5833955 aclare de una manera concreta lo que tiene pensado hacer el ayuntamiento con este servicio p blico
5833956 lo que publican los medios de comunicaci n es su opini n y su intenci n ya que no se parece en nada a lo que se dijo por parte suya y de los candidatos socialistas durante la campa a electoral municipal
5833957 la alarma que hay en la plantilla de trabajadores y en nuestras familias sobre la inseguridad de cobrar los sueldos a fin de mes extremos que parecen estar garantizados en los restantes trabajadores municipales
5833958 the film completely unravels into a mess and is not scary even with a few money shots
5833959 is a beautiful film with picturesque scenery and beautiful actors
5833960 this flick is basically hannah montana trying to become a jedi instead of a singer
5833961 i am ecstatic with summits choice for edward there are very few actors who can look both dangerous and beautiful at the same time and even fewer who i can picture in my head as edward robert pattinson is going to be amazing

5833963 this is me god is wonderful through him all things are possible
5833964 jammaar moet ik daar geen toestemming voor vragen zou men dat wel appreci ren zal dat niet in verkeerde aarde vallen
5833965 beste heer p rt kan ik u van dienst zijn met een vertaling of verkiest u liever de stilte
5833966 bergen van steen een soort mijn waaruit stenen gekapt werden
5833967 maar waar zijn die bergen dan ik zie er hier geen
5833968 euhm wel ze zijn weggekapt de mensen gebruikten alle stenen voor wegen en huizen ziet u
5833969 ik heb vernomen dat u gisteren een concert gespeeld hebt
5833970 onderschat nooit dit werk ik heb al meer slechte dan goeie uitvoeringen meegemaakt
5833971 ja natuurlijk er was zo eens een beroemde violist uit hamburg en hij zag de partituur dacht dat het zeer gemakkelijk was en besloot niet te studeren maar het werk zo op zicht in concert te spelen het was slecht
5833972 ja echt waar het werd een afgang na het concert kwam de violist zich verontschuldigen bij mij
5833973 ik voelde mij naakt daar op het podium in uw werk ik voelde me plots erg onzeker en kon me niet verbergen achter de noten u gaf mij de ultieme les in nederigheid
5833974 ik heb het uit het hoofd gespeeld om beter de structuur te snappen en het stuk echt te kunnen aanvoelen en vond de beste manier gewoon de muziek te spelen te bewonderen van op afstand zonder echt zelf iets te doen kleine fluctuaties in dynamiek vibrato zonder daar echt over wakker te liggen
5833975 de ene zin is het spiegelbeeld van de andere en wordt altijd groter en groter
5833976 ja zoiets kijk als u twee spiegels tegenover elkaar zet en in ene kijkt ziet u zichzelf weerkaatst
5833977 juist en steeds op grotere afstand dus worden de zinnen langer en langer om telkens terug te komen naar hetzelfde punt de la
5833978 wow fantastisch briljant dus eigenlijk het einde van spiegel im spiegel is facultatief
5833979 het tempo meester er staat een aanduiding kwartnoot 80 doch de violist vladimir spivakov aan wie het stuk opgedragen is speelt het trager op de cd alina en de cellist schwalke aanzienlijk vlugger mag ik daaruit afleiden dat u het niet zo strikt neemt
5833980 spivakov ja hij kan dat zo traag absoluut meesterschap en tempi dat zijn richtlijnen het gevoel van het moment is zoveel belangrijker
5833981 gisteren speelden we ook fratres een monumentaal werk in een bewerking voor cello en piano wij vinden deze compositie bij momenten zeer dramatisch hero sch zelfs die hero ek komt dat door de bewerking van fratres van kamerensemble naar 1 cello met piano
5833982 neen die dramatiek hero ek zit in de oorspronkelijke versie ook die mannelijkheid moed dat aspect wordt verwaarloosd door vele muzikanten die mijn muziek uitvoeren ze denken
5833983 p rts muziek dat is sacraal en moet verheven etherisch gespeeld worden
5833984 dus deze muziek verklankt de onmacht van de mens zijn haar gevecht met zijn haar beperkingen en heeft ontegensprekelijk een dramatische kant naar het einde toe berustend in haar lot de muziek als evenwicht tussen vrouwelijke en mannelijke aspecten die laatste vormen dan de ruggengraat van het werk
5833985 een ervaring om nooit te vergeten om een jaar later opnieuw te beleven zodat je ze nog dieper nog intenser kan ondergaan hemeltergende muziek die slaat en zalft tegelijk schreeuwt om god en zijn gebod de precisie van de pijn van het zijn vertaald in muziek in een urenlange smeekbede om verlossing
5833986 this week we urgently need all vets for freedom members to write a short letter or email to their members of congress asking them to fund the troops without timelines or deadlines for defeat
5833987 one is the defense of our homes and the other is the bill of rights
5833988 at dinner one night i was meeting with a us army major who was having a very deep battle of the conscience
5833989 most of our us soldiers have very strong sense of duty but they also have very strong senses of right versus wrong and they have good instincts to see wrong for what it is in their hands are matters of life and death and they do not take that as lightly as the arrogant bastards in washington dc
5833990 the us army or marines cannot tell you the truth lest they want to face court martial and spend the rest of their life in leavenworth as for me i am no longer concerned about making grade to colonel or general i am resigning my commission and getting out of this web of lies and evil i can no longer serve this nation and what it really stands for and what is does and will not tell america
5833991 the oss began to recruit people to go to the far east and i knew eventually id get to europe at that point id only been to tijuana and i was anxious to go to europe some time but i knew id probably never get to the far east so i volunteered and again the only thing open was in the files so i went i joined up and we had a long ocean voyage we all met in long beach california it was said we were not supposed to tell anyone where we were going or what we were doing and it was all so secret and then we got to this departure thing and there was a great big sign on it saying u s military departure for the far east and we went there were i think we had twelve women going over to join the oss detachment and we all twelve in a cabin for two sailed to by way of australia to india and we got off at bombay i remember sitting out in the harbor at dawn this kind of mist and you could smell this strange kind of odor of incense and i dont know what it was and i thought gosh what have i got myself into here
5833992 amelie style geinig om naar te kijken al vraag ik me af of het mij lang zal blijven boeien
5833993 best life is cabrio drive because the sky is the limit
5833994 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5833995 for if you forgive men when they sin against you your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you do not forgive men their sins your father will not forgive your sins
5833996 now instead you ought to forgive and comfort him so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow i urge you therefore to reaffirm your love for him
5833997 and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another forgive as the lord forgave you
5833998 voice is a bit raspy his eyes are a bit red and he walks with a hankie or tissue on hand quickly burying it in a pocket before shaking hands
5833999 always talkin bout what you got always talkin about what you got gurl you need to stop
5834000 yes we consider it to have many distinctive characteristics for example the random insertion of a japanese word or phrase in addition to its english equivalent is a feature we refer to as parallel restatement as in the pidgin construction in the club no naka
5834001 the use of a japanese term in place of an english one meanwhile can reflect key cultural differences a keitai is clearly distinct from the western concept of a cellphone that the use of either english or japanese on their own could never accomplish our research shows among other things that gaijinese contains more japanese pronouns than actual japanese also the extremely effeminate way in which male speakers tend to express themselves makes gaijinese unique among all world languages ne
5834002 were approaching a pull the plug kind of decision this is like a last stand for webcasting
5834003 most of the rate issues have not been resolved if it doesnt get much more dramatic quickly i will extricate myself from the process
5834004 were funded by venture capital theyre not going to chase a company whose business model has been broken so if it doesnt feel like its headed towards a solution were done
5834005 there are stories of the past that echo of a time long forgotten
5834006 of the great destruction and the greed which fed the machine that has destroyed the old world but i will tell you of that another time go to your homes for tonight it is about time to put out the lamp
5834007 no stars no sun no moon that is why we must remember because the time will come again
5834008 so here we remain in the belly of the beast until that day in necropolis
5834009 thats all you ever win for yourself you dumb luck drunkard
5834010 are you sure those powers of your arent picking up in other ways you arent telling us
5834011 we all know very well that his psychic abilities cannot foretell the chaos that is in the roll of elementals
5834012 waste what waste im enjoying my company they say want makes waste and all i want are my good friends with ale in their hand so what does that make of you friend
5834013 i cannot recollect a time where we have held so little patriotism we really are a nation torn in two there is no more unity no decisiveness no responsibility and no resolve weve got to do something
5834014 do your work heartily as for the lord rather than for men
5834015 wir bleiben ruhig man hat in den beiden partien gesehen dass wir mithalten k nnen mit drei bungseinheiten in der woche trainieren wir au erdem intensiver als in der letzten saison in der es nur zwei trainingsabende gegeben hat das wird sich am ende schon auszahlen
5834016 wir nehmen den pokal ernst und wollen nat rlich auf jeden fall weiterkommen au erdem wollen wir uns selbstvertrauen holen f r das n chste schwere punktspiel am kommenden sonntag beim sv sandkamp
5834017 nat rlich wird das heute auch ein schweres spiel und wir werden die reislinger nicht untersch tzen ansonsten besch ftige ich mich mit denen nicht weiter
5834018 einige junge spieler sollen geschont werden es wird aber keine zweite mannschaft sein ganz im gegenteil die anderen die bis jetzt noch nicht zum zuge gekommen sind haben nun die chance sich in die erste elf zu spielen
5834019 a quoi sa rime de rentrer la maison si tu es bourr
5834020 do you realize how much responsibility that is its like having a kid
5834021 im not moving until you let me go one more block
5834022 im not moving until you let me go one or several more blocks
5834023 we have no concept of time lets go for a walk
5834024 three fulfilling years coordinating an english language instruction drive at state schools in japan designing and delivering a vastly improved curriculum using the latest tesol methods as well as internationalising a generation of young japanese
5834025 now you know your abc its high five time cos youve passed your jlpt
5834026 to blog or not to blog that is your summer vacation
5834027 there are myriad ways to level up your understanding of japan and strengthen skinship with fellow gaijin one of these is to start a weblog to describe in great detail the problems faced by japan propose solutions and exchange frank views with other gaijin in a friendly supportive environment the discipline of writing allied to the rigours of peer feedback will serve as excellent preparation not only for your upcoming graduation theses but also for your future as the published authors of books about japan
5834028 but remember as university of gaijin students you should strive not only to become knowledgeable in all things japanese but to also come to terms with your own being in japan fearlessly querying your motives and applying the same critical analysis to yourselves as you would to japan itself now let the online pontification begin
5834029 ive amassed a huge file of engrish pictures in the past year so i think ill focus my blogging activities on posting them one by one with whatever puns i can think of to add value for my readers
5834030 i plan to blog humorously about rampant objectification of women and gender discrimination in the workplace to make it clear that if japanese women choose to align themselves with me there will be no such problems
5834031 if you can hear yourself really really well youre playing to loud
5834032 oh god can i puke now there is more going on than just those two cities despite what youll hear on this board
5834033 a mettrait aussi longtemps que de faire 500 m pied
5834034 english equivalents like atonal tone deaf and out of tune are too loaded to be of any use as musical genre markers
5834035 however onchi is new to most people so its meaning is yet to be fixed it can be used to indicate something that is out of tune in a good way like a lot of japanese music
5834036 id say it does yes when i fire off another missive about post j punk or electrokabuki i do get a hit of superiority that sometimes lasts all day youll find that most gaijin either dismiss japanese music as derivative and will have nothing to do with it or else glom onto lame acts like afrirampo and polysics just because they happen to look cool whereas im out there showing that japanese music is in fact contrapuntal and difficult for normal people to understand
5834037 we strongly believe that it doesnt matter who you vote for as long as you vote
5834038 most likely incentives to be used by consumers to save money on energy costs are discounts 34 percent and rebates 22 percent
5834039 energy star label is extremely or very important to 68 percent of respondents
5834040 i expect there will be additional charges coming the number and type i cant say with certainty
5834041 i drive race cars and go 85 miles per hour
5834042 i made a lot of new friends and met other kids who are diabetic
5834043 its made me eat better and you know think more
5834044 its not that bad because you get used to it after awhile
5834045 i guess we did a lot of things you wouldnt think we would do camping like making pasties and potato sausage and things like that
5834046 the no worker left behind really is a collaboration of partners
5834047 its a collaboration between the state of michigan the michigan works agencies across the state of michigan and the area educational institutions

5834049 quiero decirle a mi hijo lo siguente del toro nacieron los toros band y del toro naci el torito no puedo pedile a l que deje el mote del torito porque naci del toro y fue bautizado por el pueblo
5834050 a veces me pongo a pensar que he construido un monstruo que me quiere destruir porque de por dios si t est s bien d jame vivir
5834051 esto se me parece al cuento de la luci rnaga y la serpiente que la serpiente andaba detr s de la luci rnaga para matarla y sta le pregunt por qu la persegu a y quer a destruirla y la serpiente le contest porque tienes una luz que brilla y esa luz me molesta
5834052 creo que est lleno de mucho rechazo guarda mucho rencor
5834053 eso me hace pensar que es una persona que guarda muchas cosas y que tiene que limpiar su coraz n como es cristiano que le pida en sus oraciones al se or que le sane su coraz n porque lo que dios no le dio con la bendici n de dios le di lo que le faltaba grandeza
5834054 la gente y el trabajo soy un hombre de trabajo voy a seguir luchando siendo perseverante y nunca me voy a olvidar de que t eres mi hijo y que yo soy tu pap debieras de preocuparte cada d a que te levantas en llamarme y saludarme no desearme que me olvide de lo nico que tengo
5834055 we know that all male gaijin sans own at least one black dress shirt as this allows them to have the quasi professional attire while reminding other gaijin sans that even though they must go to work they are still alternative types
5834056 however while black shirts may be useful value signifiers in gaijin homelands such as western canada and northern europe they are unsuitable for our japanese climate and worn here only by pimps bartenders and magicians and only at night we strongly advise our own students not to bring black shirts from their own countries but it seems that some have no other shirts
5834057 the thought of the us air force on its way would have deterred even vladimir putin
5834058 i wish president musharraf all the best we have had difficult days together but also we had good days together all in all we had a good relationship
5834059 the most important thing is not personalities what is important is that we change our expectations and the way we formulate policies to meet those expectations
5834060 if they are doing that in order to get strategic depth it will not happen it has been tried before it failed if they are doing that in order to have a puppet government it will not happen it will not work
5834061 if they are doing that to gain an upper hand against another of their neighbors
5834062 my view is if youre looking to find a burglary follow the drugs
5834063 someones got a drug problem someone doesnt you look at the guy whos got the problem and thats not my client
5834064 both were involved in the attempt to get into this residence in new durham
5834065 both fled the scene in the car that was searched it is mr coreys car
5834066 we thought that a school that was all girls that eliminated distractions that come sometimes with a coed environment and teach healthy social skills would really make an impact
5834067 sometimes it takes additional support and encouragement for girls to keep their confidence about going into fields that have been identified as fields for men
5834068 with older school buildings almost all them have environmental concerns that have to be addressed and franklin is no different against some of the other things that are in place it has a great auditorium it has a great stage we dont have to allocate dollars to address those things

5834074 a candid acknowledgement that prejudice war and exploitation have been the expression of immature stages in a vast historical process and that the human race is today experiencing the unavoidable tumult which marks its collective coming of age is not a reason for despair but a prerequisite to undertaking the stupendous enterprise of building a peaceful world that such an enterprise is possible that the necessary constructive forces do exist that unifying social structures can be erected is the theme we urge you to examine
5834075 wenn man seine chancen nicht nutzt muss man bis zum ende zittern
5834076 nach der vorbereitung wei man nie so richtig wo man steht deshalb war der sieg im ersten spiel sehr wichtig f r uns
5834077 itll be beneficial because were planning on being in that race next year
5834078 guys that have never been there dont know what its like we need to get a taste of it

5834082 eight members of the chicago franchise were banned from baseball for throwing intentionally losing games giving the victory to the cincinnati reds
5834083 why yes we will happily take the money that you are shelling out and turn around and use it for one of our foundations to help save lives better the living standards of people who would otherwise do without
5834084 you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks
5834085 need them if i were fender id be trying to make very nice with activision and harmonix right now
5834086 ive just seen the sample of this years cole haan gift bag which was exclusively designed for our party and i can say its the most beautiful bag we have had yet
5834087 this year we are celebrating at a bigger venue that will give us some elbow room as the comedy central emmy party has become a very popular annual event
5834088 we are enhancing the decor at the restaurant with lots of comedy central special touches
5834089 now i can blame four other people if anything goes wrong
5834090 actually here you have people who do hosting for a living and are unique to this year because of the new category so why not
5834091 to first have the emmys create a reality host category and then ask us to host was a pretty nice gesture
5834092 to be nominated is a huge accomplishment im not even thinking about the possibility of winning at this moment
5834093 i will be shimmying into more than a few nice frocks emmy evening you can count on it i feel it would be rude not to
5834094 from a viewing standpoint the reason you watch these shows is to see if your favorite actor is in the bathroom when the award is announced or if they read a teleprompter as if they just got hooked on phonics
5834095 what i love is the unpredictability of a live show and i dont plan to over rehearse this i want to be reactive
5834096 that being said it would be really nice to win and i did go to ikea and looked at some shelves
5834097 we need academic freedom and an ability to talk about these things without fearing legal consequences
5834098 now that the court proceedings are behind us i renew my invitation to the students to sit down with us and discuss their findings
5834099 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
5834100 the games have not helped they have actually slowed down work that was progressing and increased abuses
5834101 the approach that beijing chose for the preparation of the games was to suppress any critical voices and to prevent these voices from finding an echo in the international media
5834102 they made that annoucement for the outside world but within the country they repress people
5834103 its clear that its because of the olympic games because we lost contact just before the beginning of the games
5834104 i was being followed and watched and the situation was very tense so i decided to leave
5834105 before the olympics the police authorities visited us and talked to the dissidents and they were prepared for their freedoms to be restricted during the olympics and from what we have seen so far many people have been followed or monitored
5834106 to date what had been announced publicly doesnt appear in reality to be happening and a number of questions are being asked
5834107 the ioc is keen to see those questions answered by the relevant authorities

5834269 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5834270 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
5834271 we have not heard anything officially from cricket australia and until we do we are not in a position to make any comment
5834272 what we have done is to very clearly outline to each of these stakeholders the plan that we have in place for the champions trophy in pakistan
5834273 understandably there are safety concerns and thats what we are engaged in and we are dealing with
5834274 the ecb has received a briefing from us and have gone into a board meeting they will consider our briefing among other reports that they may have on whether they will participate or not but that is a decision for the ecb as far as the icc are concerned the safety and security is satisfactory for hosting the tournament in pakistan
5834275 its something i would not be able to tell you at this point
5834276 i wouldnt be able to tell you what would be in the minds of the icc board when it sits to consider such an eventuality it would be great for the best teams to attend and every one of the best players to come
5834277 i think weve got to a position where its very difficult to do it to the position where we could stage a successful world class event
5834278 at this point in time there is no discussion about a late move it is speculative until member boards or teams clearly indicate what their view is as far as we are concerned the tournament continues in pakistan
5834279 every single day our security advisors update themselves and in turn us on the changing political environment in pakistan the advice on the current development is that the status quo remains unchanged if anything it is a step in the right direction and im quoting their words

5834561 what do we mean by speedy pullout reuters colonel general anatoly nogovitsyn deputy head of russias general staff on tuesday held his daily briefing on russian military operations in georgia
5834562 what do we mean by speedy pullout it means that the process will become more dynamic because so far we have suspended it and it is flowing slowly now because of a pressing need to create new posts for peacekeepers to take key functions under control and stabilise the situation with uncontrolled movements of armed people in different directions
5834563 currently we are preparing equipment to set up new peacekeeping posts which according to agreements reached in moscow will be set up as an extra measure to ensure security in the zone of the peacekeeping operation
5834564 we will finish setting them up before august 22 after peacekeeping posts are put in place the troops pullout will be more intense
5834565 the need for additional peacekeeping posts is dictated by the reality in the zone of the operation every day we discover and disarm unidentified groups of armed people who are not controlled and do not report to the georgian side
5834566 whats the need to deploy nuclear weapons in our baltic fleet and whats the connection between that and our situation here i mean the conflict in south ossetia
5834567 a reinforced group of peacekeepers is continuing to act to prevent aggression from the georgian side we continue to collect arms and military equipment confiscated from the georgian side
5834568 despite the fact that georgian president mikheil saakashvili put his signature to the six point agreement envisaging the pullout of troops to their original positions today we are increasingly convinced that this order is not being carried out

5834632 im not saying that anyone would be forced to do anything because im a federalist and believe in the rights of states but at the same time theres already been discussion amongst the states and i believe that more discussion amongst the governors is probably something that everybody wants us to do
5834633 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue

5834637 i think its difficult these days because when you choose to have a family and a career youve got day care issues youve got kids going to schools and getting them places where they need to be so i think its a tough decision for a lot of women
5834638 we just werent ready we got married a little bit older we dated longer got married a little older and we just wanted time to get ourselves together as individuals and as a couple
5834639 labor force participation is higher in this whole metropolitan area
5834640 49 percent of mothers with a birth in the last year in d c were never married
5834641 the national average is 28 percent so its significantly higher
5834642 the surveys core result is that people care about their communities and express the desire to see government action taken toward local and national issues
5834643 people are hesitant to support efforts concerning global issues even though they believe that environmental quality is poorer at the global level than at the local and national level this is surprising given the media attention that global warming has recently received and reflects the division of opinion about the severity of climate change
5834644 americans are clearly most concerned about pollution issues that might affect their personal health or the health of their families
5834645 it will have a very serious impact on the economy

5834660 i cant believe it im still in a state of shock
5834661 it just felt like they was coming from nowhere when you hear gunshots your first instinct is to just run
5834662 when i was holding her and i put my hand underneath her and i pulled it out and it had blood on it
5834663 her death was for no purpose at all she just got killed for nothing that she probably dont even know we dont know why everybody keeps asking us what happened we dont even know what happened
5834664 i just hope they catch to did it or somebody come forth with some information
5834665 hot therapy hot water anybody will tell you that it does work
5834666 youre supposed to push the buttons and it comes on but nothings coming on
5834667 its telling me i am in full mode but im not
5834668 it has like 84 jets theres not 84 jets blowing
5834669 right now would be a great time for him to be able to use this spa
5834670 i dont know what to tell you weve been out there numerous times at no charge to him
5834671 he could have just asked me for a new tub
5834672 the management team of dm industries is a compassionate one so we will see what we can do i believe what has not taken place here is a full and complete analysis of what the problem is and the correction
5834673 ive not really had a whole lot to say to tell you the truth
5834674 as to when ill be back on the practice field thats still to be determined obviously the sooner the better for me my goal is to be back for the first game
5834675 this maybe will stop some of the whining going on
5834676 i just didnt want to get into these daily progress reports ive done nothing but rehab i guess were sort of in the rumor mill now i dont wear a knee brace i wore this wrap today really for the first time
5834677 if were to the point of someone putting a cell phone picture on the news thats a little disappointing so i guess ill squash that right now its not true i dont wear a knee brace
5834678 i dont know if any of those injured guys will be out there on the 7th but my guess is they will be
5834679 i think im close to 100 percent im definitely good enough to compete and play
5834680 its great to be running around with my teammates instead of standing around wishing you were out there
5834681 rehabbing is something ill have to continue to do throughout my career whats important is to continue to use that time to make sure youre mentally sharp
5834682 we need to know what our government is doing to spy upon americans
5834683 i cant believe ive never seen this line miss me before
5834684 wow this dress is gorgeous i will totally wear this alone or with leggings underneath i cant believe im shopping for cold weather already im not ready for it
5834685 no systematic differences between cultivation systems representing organic and conventional production methods were found across the five crops so the study does not support the belief that organically grown foodstuffs generally contain more major and trace elements than conventionally grown foodstuffs
5834686 overall organic farming is better for tackling climate change than industrial agricultural methods as well as lower average energy use organic farming also avoids the very large nitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer manufacture
5834687 additionally organic farming builds up soil carbon removing it from the atmosphere organic farming also supports more local food marketing reducing food miles
5834688 local farmers are involved in cultivating oregano parsley thyme peppermint rosemary rose geranium artimisia stevia lemon grass and several other herbal and medicinal plants
5834689 our approach is two pronged firstly we are trying to build awareness about organic farming which is in its infancy in india and secondly we are trying to build awareness within the culinary industry in india
5834690 the response has been very positive they are overwhelmed that we are going so close to nature and that their food is fresh from the farmland to the table
5834691 i think our first step should be to get the united states of america fully engaged
5834692 what is heartening on that question is that both candidates have indicated that they will be moving on this and with an ambitious set of targets
5834693 there is no way the first world can solve this problem alone even if the united states comes in
5834694 in normal years the pacific ocean area of high pressure covers the whole of japan but this year its power is weak while cool air enters the air there is still damp warm air underneath so atmospheric conditions become unstable making it easy for thunderclouds to develop
5834695 in mid august when there was a lot of heavy rain and lightning strikes there were over 10 inquiries a day
5834696 at this time last year there had only been a few inquiries
5834697 the only response to counter lightning surges is to turn off the power and unplug the equipment if you hear thunder
5834698 we connected the dotss to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
5834699 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
5834700 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
5834701 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
5834702 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
5834703 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere
5834704 as wed expected in applying our model increased smoke from the fires created clouds rife with a more pronounced radiative effect rich with human caused aerosols that absorbed sunlight warmed the local atmosphere and blocked evaporation this led to reduced cloud cover over the amazon
5834705 and its encouraging to know the science behind our model should stand no matter the region
5834706 there are vulnerabilities all around the australian coastline she said
5834707 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible
5834708 this really is very early work and many more factors need to be taken into account before we have concrete projections she said
5834709 it is going to be a negative story leading to damage of assets and loss of value
5834710 the evidence over the past 12 to 18 months suggests that we have underestimated how fast this aspect of the earths system can change he said
5834711 most complex and difficult challenge we have faced as a species
5834712 in the 21st century a sea level rise of at least 0 5 metres is a certainty a rise of 1 to 1 5 metres is more likely while a rise of up to four metres this century is possible he said
5834713 the pressing reality of climate change is upon us and all the evidence points to coastlines being the most vulnerable she said adding that there would be considerable damage to coastal settlements in particular aboriginal communities
5834714 los candidatos de la fuerza del cambio comprometidos con el logro de la dignidad de nuestro estado asistieron a esta reuni n para intercambiar opiniones sobre los diversos temas que est n tocando la palestra pol tica en nuestro pa s y dispuestos a conformar el comando de la unidad que nos har victoriosos en las pr ximas elecciones del 23 de noviembre
5834715 si nosotros nos organizamos podemos luchar para lograr el equilibrio en la aplicaci n de la justicia en venezuela ltimamente nos seguimos dando cuenta que la balanza se inclina para un s lo lado y eso es un abuso as que les invito a combatir de la mejor forma el paquetazo de las 23 leyes reci n aprobadas por el ejecutivo y nuestra mejor herramienta para esta batalla es a trav s del ejercicio del voto
5834716 eso fue un acto de proselitismo pol tico de total abuso de poder que fue transmitido por el canal que supuestamente es de todos los venezolanos y es que el centralismo que se hab a ido de venezuela ahora un grupo quiere devolverlo e imponerlo pero esta realidad tambi n ser combatida a trav s del voto
5834717 los candidatos asistentes a la reuni n no deben estar casados con una fuerza pol tica si no con la visi n del pa s que queremos comprometidos para lograr la fuerza del cambio un cambio que genere progreso avance modernidad que combata la inseguridad donde prevalezca la visi n de descentralizar y se le transfiera el poder a los ciudadanos en su derecho de escoger libremente las opciones pol ticas de su preferencia y que no le sean impuestas a dedo

5834720 were challenging his experience were challenging his judgment were going to challenge his equivocation on some of the critical issues we never we havent and we wont challenge his patriotism
5834721 instead of just offering policy answers he mccain turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country
5834722 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5834723 oone of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5834724 unlike barack obama john mccain doesnt have to compensate for a lack of credibility on the international stage with inflammatory and public threats against american allies
5834725 doug murren is one of a kind uniquely able to speak the timeless truths of the gospel straight to the minds and more importantly to the hearts of contemporary boomers and busters
5834726 your father knows what you need before you ask him
5834727 now that we actually have the selection done and out there in public its just a huge huge feeling of gratification
5834728 but its definitely less overarching especially if you look at the telling real to reel section do you feel that this years festival has an overall theme or specific focus at least in some sense
5834729 crudes just getting pulled up by heating oil it was a quick pop and technical triggers may have been hit
5834730 especially since there is a clear lack of buying momentum
5834731 venezuela would have to analyze the possibility of a production cut
5834732 this is an informational presentation by the states nuclear engineer because of the technical nature of the material and pending studies we will not be answering questions about vy any concerns should be addressed in the facilitated discussions or in a comment form thank you
5834733 attendees will be asked to break into five equal groups and join one of the facilitated workstations each workstation has a specific question for brainstorming after completion attendees will be asked to move through the remaining workstations and participate in the other questions
5834734 it seems like everything out there is bad for us i mean what can i eat drink breathe
5834735 why should mothers have to be chemical engineers while theyre shopping for their kids
5834736 thousands upon thousands of jobs in the u s rely on that oil
5834737 and 25 percent of all of our untapped resources are there thats a big deal
5834738 and were seeing tremendous interest in getting canadian crude into the philadelphia market
5834739 we looked at whether canada could reduce exports for the sake of conservation or environmental policy or even for household heating we cannot
5834740 and figuring out how we can make this work for all people
5834741 the canadians might look for other options if we became difficult customers
5834742 if it turns out that these technologies dont advance and the only way to produce these resources would be at a significant penalty to climate change then we dont believe that those resources are going to be part of the long term future
5834743 there is a huge infrastructure investment being made in a fuel that in our view is taking us in the wrong direction its making it more difficult for us to fully address the global warming issue
5834744 the solar bonus scheme will boost our use of renewable energy encourage energy efficiency and stimulate the solar power industry in queensland
5834745 itll help people save money save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions
5834746 households and small businesses will receive credits on their electricity bill for any additional power they generate through their solar systems that is fed into the electricity grid
5834747 its estimated the scheme could save consumers more than 25 percent off their annual electricity bill depending on how energy efficient they are in their home
5834748 we are strongly of the view that ret is very likely to result in abatement that is at higher costs than would otherwise be necessary to meet our emissions reductions targets the groups chief executive heather ridout said
5834749 i want to make very clear that the renewable energy target was a very clear election commitment to the australian people by the rudd labor government and its a commitment we will be meeting senator wongsaid in sydney
5834750 we believe it is important for the government to provide incentives to the market to invest in renewable energy so that future generations of australians have a range of clean energy options available to them she said
5834751 we remain committed to ensuring that 20 per cent of australias energy comes from renewable sources by 2020
5834752 were holding the 2008 meeting here in dubai to elevate regional public attention to a number of important issues related to the ongoing food crisis and its impact on the middle east
5834753 we need to rethink and formulate innovative pathways for new policies to boost investments in regional and global agricultural productivity to meet the growing demand for food
5834754 certainly this is one way to connect the importance of international action and co operation on commodity development in producing countries which form the majority of the funds membership the international community must address both the matter of the food crisis and security as well as economic growth on the part of commodity producers since their full participation in global trade is the only realistic solution for ending poverty and guaranteeing sustainable food production supply and security
5834755 the structural explanations culture history of communism oil and gas can be easily overplayed while the actual decisions and mistakes of individual leaders can be forgotten or excused
5834756 benjamin l cardin has been a national leader on health care retirement security and fiscal issues since coming to congress in 1987
5834757 it crippled our offices ability to get anything else done
5834758 if you go much further people arent going to come forward
5834759 i dont think it makes a lot of sense to be sending troops after them
5834760 you cant hide from what needs to be done you have to deal with the 12 million with border security and with the fairness issue
5834761 internal communication at the beginning of the 21st century is about relationship building where it technically resides is less important than that it builds solid working relationships with those responsible for each of the companys stakeholders be that with hr pr investor relations government communication or any other communication discipline various functions working sensibly to leverage the crossovers in their roles could include joint policy development strategic planning initiatives on training and employee development shared expertise on printing and writing and shared expertise on web development ultimately however the forecast is that communication will complete the journey from these working alliances to a single integrated internal external function its the only way to really drive value when they operate together they can join forces integrate and coordinate to act as strategic liaisons between employees stakeholders and other organizational departments in order to help the organization achieve its goals
5834762 link students and citizens with political leaders and create a serious sustained discussion about clean energy solutions
5834763 making change with media a five minute guide to eco publishing
5834764 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5834765 the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5834766 mitchell did what has become a pattern for her of simply repeating obama campaign talking points
5834767 mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5834768 mitchell is repeating uncritically a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5834769 instead of trying to substantiate this blatant falsehood in any way andrea mitchell felt that she needed to repeat it on air to millions
5834770 he is white and its racist to congratulate him for his accomplishments
5834771 untapped algae energy research by axi and others goes global
5834772 after iraq we may be tempted to turn inward that would be a mistake the american moment is not over but it must be seized anew
5834773 in the aftermath of world war ii and with the coming of the cold war members of the greatest generation united america and the free world around shared values and actions that changed history our times call for equally bold leadership
5834774 to protect american personnel and facilities continue training iraqi security forces and root out al qaeda

5834803 you want people to think well of you dont you
5834804 the founders of our nation recognized that the backbone of a strong united states was dependent upon the active participation of its citizens in their government not only are larger more regional governments more expensive and less efficient as this report shows but they make citizen participation more difficult regionalism will very likely result in less participation and more apathy thus eroding our local democracy
5834805 the prevalent view that multiple local governments are less efficient is valid only in the minds of those who havent looked at the facts
5834806 in new york the data clearly shows that smaller governments that are closer to the people the towns and villages are far more efficient less costly than larger regional governments proposals to consolidate governments may sound good but would actually be a disservice to taxpayers
5834807 it is our hope that the states decision makers will recognize that new yorks smaller governments for the most part are better positioned to provide essential services to their residents with the greatest efficiency
5834808 we hope that displaying carbon footprints will raise awareness among consumers as well as companies of their emissions and motivate them to emit less c02
5834809 at some point youve got to figure out what it is its now what i want but at this juncture its something that needs to happen
5834810 i have some numbness in my fingers im not used to having
5834811 as far as pain goes theres pretty much no pain at all its just that weve got to figure out what the hell it was its something weve dealt with but ive never had to deal with it on that level
5834812 anytime theres something wrong with your arm and youre a baseball player especially a pitcher you obviously think the worst first but ive kind of been reassured by people that its not that
5834813 they cause a lot of unneeded soreness but if it gets to that point well do whatever we need to do
5834814 i was testing my equipment i was a professional motorcycle racer and my bike malfunctioned and i went over the handlebars breaking my neck my c 4 c 5 c 6 complete quadriplegic
5834815 its not likely you recover to this point from any injury that severe
5834816 from the very beginning it was a choice to become proactive and really challenge the adversity
5834817 we knew the gravity of the injury and knew what would happen if we didnt
5834818 my motivation is this is my second chance at life
5834819 and the most important thing for me is just sharing time and love with my family and friends and having a purpose filled life having an opportunity to again to walk and live and to things like this its motivating for me to share the story and connect with other individuals and their families and get it together
5834820 im inspired daily and seeing other people get motivated and excited about possibilities is all i can hope for i lay down at night happy
5834821 i believe that no child should be turned away from a high quality preschool experience because their parents cant afford it or because their community does not have the preschool programs they need

5834862 its been a great experience for our club to have a couple of those young lads out here and they have handled themselves really well on the training track
5834863 they havent been able to train with the main group afl rules but they have done little bits and pieces by themselves

5834877 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5834878 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
5834879 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5834880 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
5834881 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
5834882 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
5834883 hydrogen has long been considered the ideal clean green fuel energy rich and carbon neutral the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world

5834886 i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be take are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge there are limits therefore to what can be delegated

5834949 what are the practical implications of pokemon in a real world
5834950 to become a pastor and to get your training in counselling
5834951 the way we came out not so much on the first drive but once we got our feet wet we did a great job of responding we dictated what they wanted to do we got them in some third and long situations and we knew they had to pass the ball everyone knows our strength is when we can get our pass rushers on the field and get after the quarterback
5834952 the best thing was how we responded after they got three points one of our goals was to not let them get any points on their first drive and to come out and start fast
5834953 we played alright it was a great kick by him dawson but i loved the way we responded and came out and really made them come to our level we really picked it up that second drive and beyond and thats encouraging
5834954 i thought he was about to get hawked down but he came up with a huge play that allowed the defense to put some points on the board we love scoring on defense
5834955 his play butler enabled us to get big plays key plays and get the momentum going not only just to stop them on defense but then to score it really gets the whole team going and thats what it is all about
5834956 the more you play the more you get accustomed to what is expected of you and what offenses want to do to this football team obviously youre going to be more confident
5834957 it was absolutely a good test for us then again they didnt have one of their key weapons obviously they didnt have braylon tonight but they had a great year last year and made some key acquisitions this year whenever you have a tight end like winslow and a wide receiver like braylon and a running back like lewis youre going to be ok
5834958 its a competition out there because osi got a sack and i was very upset out there thats the way it is when he gets sack im upset and when i get a sack hes upset and i think that helps us we definitely fuel the flame if any of us get sacks i guess you can call us haters but its not like were hating on each other its more like you got one now im have to get one or else im going to have to deal with you all week in the film room saying i got one and you didnt so i think that really helps us and we thrive off stuff like that
5834959 we got a lot of pressure we did with our first group we looked quicker and obviously played at a better tempo tonight than we did a week ago yeah there was pressure but i dont know about the rest of the way though
5834960 ab 1407 will give customers information on runway safety at an airport and provide a mechanism to determine if their flight is one that is frequently delayed
5834961 delayed flights not only inconvenience travelers and their families but result in tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue and productivity
5834962 runway incursions pose a serious threat to the safety of passengers it is important that travelers have access to this basic information
5834963 from july 23rd to august 24th the phillies will appear during prime time on espn five times more than any other major league team of the first four sunday night games in august the phillies have played in two of them and been featured during the week twice by espn
5834964 in summation pedro p martinez is heating up and surging so is pedro j martinez now how about you do the same mr pedro e martinez until you prove yourself you are a disgrace to your name
5834965 are you giving me a dirty look do you want a time out
5834966 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5834967 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5834968 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5834969 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5834970 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5834971 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5834972 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future

5834998 the concept behind shitkatapult is there is no concept at all
5834999 every release is different anything goes from the more serious organo chemistry of apparat and the musical middle finger of t raumschmiere to the mutant tech disco of das bierbeben
5835000 we seek serious artists people with something to say who cannot do anything but express it this way and no other
5835001 we accept demos but they hardly get heard although some of the artists have been discovered by demos being sent
5835002 t raumschmiere will have a massive new album soon and stay tuned for clps new one this fall
5835003 joel clark and myself we were pretty good at it
5835004 we spent years doing it and it wasnt as popular and all over tv as it is now but we had some success skating was a different kind of scene when it was our lives but i relate it to being in a band in that it showed me that if i really commit to doing something i love something can become of it without that belief we probably wouldnt have been able to start the band in the first place but i think anyone who accomplishes anything starts out delusional so embrace those delusions
5835005 we might be a tighter live band if we had approached the performance aspect of it like skating
5835006 but being in this band isnt about landing a trick till you can get it right every time i always like to get something new doesnt matter what it is i just want to be around something that i dont always know how it works because it always seems to have some magic inside not understanding what youre doing at first is fantastic
5835007 on wet from birth we just sat around the computer recording a track at a time seeing who would play the next bass line
5835008 i feel like the misconception of who we are as people after danse macabre helped shape wet from birth a lot of people expected us to be really goth depressed dreary dudes that wore black leather so we spent a year trying to capture more of why its fun to see us live the energetic upbeat side of the band not the part that dwells on the darker side of life except at times we ended up taking that goal kind of seriously during the process
5835009 we did that for a while but then we realized there was something too meticulous recording every idea and weeding out the bad ones i feel we learned that theres kind of a reason for using both approaches and it depends on the song
5835010 i think our initial idea of the record was quite a bit different
5835011 we were going to react to wet from birth which was somewhat more of a project so we were going to stand in a room with instruments writing as humans not midi and then nothing happened since were not a jam band once we got more into exploring methods than sticking to a single direction the songs started coming even freer
5835012 he comes from the tape op world more than the mix world
5835013 and thats where im at i do this for the love of immediate hands on production more than wanting to use a multi million dollar commercial compound
5835014 every project is different sure and the faints studio was very interesting because of the building
5835015 that building had challenges it had a certain long narrow shape
5835016 we installed an array of swinging panels in the tracking room built with rpg diffusor systems
5835017 this allows you to change from a more dead to a more live sound tweak the decay characteristics we actually custom built new cabinetry for the console we had a somewhat local woodworker jeff mccabe do it a really nice job it put the console at the right height for the reflection free acoustics of the wall mounted speaker control room design kept things exact for stereo symmetry and kept room to accompany several large keyboards all of that was done in maple to match the vintage floors
5835018 i dont know if the band has a sweet spot but theres definitely a spot where dodging often needs to happen
5835019 we have low gritty synth sounds so we need the kick drums to sit right and the low end to feel good and tight id come in early and work on the mix setting it up for the day for others to work on i definitely enjoyed the control room when working with finding that low mid balance and also with small sounds subtle frequencies i remember some people hearing some tracks and wondering what we were doing but i knew it was badass dry as fuck and rad and in a way by being questioned it reaffirmed our confidence in what were doing which is to always search for new territory
5835020 can run in any number of physical and virtual oses operating system environments within a server farm as long as the number of physical processors being used by running instances of the software at any one time does not exceed the number of licenses assigned to servers in the server farm
5835021 in a time zone that is within four hours of the local time zone of the other
5835022 count the greatest number of physical processors at any time supporting running instances across your server farm and assign that number of licenses
5835023 these instances run on a server farm made up of 20 servers each with four physical processors if just three unique physical processors support the three running instances then based on the licensing changes you need only three sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses so you can run those three instances anywhere in your server farm if however two physical processors support each of the running instances for a total of six unique physical processors in this scenario you would need six sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses without the licensing changes you would need 80 processor licenses to support moving the instances freely in the server farm
5835024 by 22 august a part of the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the temporary security zone
5835025 the remaining contingent that was used to reinforce the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the territory of south ossetia and to russia
5835026 this is one of the first units to be pulled out
5835027 the russians time and again move their tanks to tskhinvali the south ossetian capital from gori and then back again i categorically deny this amounts to a withdrawal
5835028 you can probably judge objectively for yourselves the state of georgian democracy and who is trying to wreck it
5835029 hey weve got no pitching lets say we trade edinson volquez for josh hamilton
5835030 if it sticks then ill know if youve been a bad girl
5835031 man to serve him wittingly in the tangle of his mind if he suffers us to fall to such a case that there is no escaping then we may stand our tackle as best we can but its gods part not our own to bring ourselves to that extremity our natural business lies in escaping

5835039 manny has accomplished so much for the state of over the past eighteen months in his role as deputy secretary of education manny worked tirelessly to demand greater education accountability and provide meaningful reform in the process he oversaw the greatest infusion of education aid that our state has ever seen
5835040 manny has had a long and successful career serving s students after devoting so much of his life to public service i wish him the best in his future endeavors in the private sector
5835041 the opportunity to serve as the senior education policy advisor in two executive administrations has been a tremendous experience
5835042 i was going to sit there until well you know
5835043 i like your klutziness its brightening up a dull morning
5835044 lets see open up she said nodding at the discman resting between my legs

5835046 no i want this but dont you think you should turn the water off first
5835047 the civil rights act of 1964 says that faith based organizations have a right to hire people who believe like they do would you insist that faith based organizations forfeit that right to access federal funds
5835048 whoever is playing as long as theyre making plays thats the constant you want
5835049 i would much rather have constant plays as opposed to just knowing what that guy is about and how he plays the bottom line is production if youre always getting production thats what really matters and thats how you gauge things
5835050 were doing a lot of things different with coverages trying to get jumps on receivers trying to get jumps on routes
5835051 we get a lot of pass breakups but we want interceptions
5835052 sometimes were in position to make tackles well were asking those guys to strip its not ok to just be in position to break a pass up its not ok when we have a guy wrapped up and youre the second man in and you finish him off we want them to strip it out
5835053 when i got here i felt i could fit in with the defense
5835054 i thought i could have contributed but i really wasnt ready back then i had older guys ahead of me that had way more experience than i did they knew what to do in certain situations and i didnt i was athletic enough but my mind wasnt ready
5835055 hes a physical player thats the one thing about him first and foremost he brings a physical presence in there and thats what we like starting off

5835059 we both played a lot of football last season and showed the giants and the fans that if called upon we can deliver
5835060 it really doesnt matter here if you are starter or not everybody has a role to play and a way to contribute and the way we have rotated our defensive linemen everyone in that group gets a chance to make plays
5835061 i am still trying to prove that i belong in this league even though i had a first year that you could not ask for much more
5835062 i still have to make a name for myself i can get better
5835063 i never thought jeremy would not be back with the giants there was talk of him being traded to the saints around the draft and then when that did not happen i didnt think about it anymore but when he was traded i was at the airport in portland on my way to training camp i got a text from my high school coachs son trey ecker he said the trade had happened i was going through security i just put the phone away i thought naw what does an 8 year old know about that and then later i picked up my phone at the airport and i had 15 missed calls and a bunch more text messages i guess even 8 year olds know whats going on in the nfl after all
5835064 i dont ever want to be known as a one dimensional guy
5835065 i think im just as fast and quick as i am strong i want to build off of last year but not rest or rely on last year our defensive line is a brotherhood we compete against each other we get mad when one of us gets a sack and each guy turns that into getting one of his own on this team its all about reaching the respect of your peers in this locker room
5835066 hey i saved them some dollars by signing a couple of weeks early

5835100 the only people more wrong proudly call themselves skeptics skeptics exist to screw with your mind and display socially disfunctional behavior
5835101 until we have a clear sense of what will prevail monetary policy makers must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures
5835102 unless the python that is the u s economy can quickly pass the recent burst of cost push pressures we risk a reinforcing spreading of inflationary impulses and expectations
5835103 should this happen and the fed were to fail to address it we would run the risk of losing the publics confidence in our ability to constrain inflation
5835104 it depends on how sustained it is it is a question of durability and i think it is too early to call

5835111 it was important that we did play the game no matter where it was we have everything set out and the players were looking forward to the two games
5835112 they have made a decision on that now and i think its important they have made that decision
5835113 at least we know we are playing that game and people are looking forward to that now
5835114 but no matter where the game was we would have gone and played it anywhere because it is important for the group and it is important to get the three points
5835115 whatever is laudable in our works proceeds from the grace of god
5835116 wherefore o king let my counsel be acceptable to thee and redeem thy sins by almsgivings and thine unrighteousness by mercies to the poor and god will be patient to thy sins
5835117 therefore o king take my advice atone for your sins by good deeds and for your misdeeds by kindness to the poor then your prosperity will be long

5835120 history has shown plainly that the tendency of arminianism is to compromise and to drift gradually from an evangelical basis hence it is that to this day there has never been developed a logical and systematic body of arminiam theology it has in the methodist church for instance a brief and informal creed in some twenty five articles but contract between the statement and the carefully wrought out westminster confession is seen at a glace

5835173 they were saying things like are you sure the plane didnt land at reagan airport and they set off a bomb they kept coming up with all these scenarios quote where did you see the plane
5835174 how sure are you it was on the north side of the gas station
5835175 you cant say more than 100 percent because there is no way it was anywhere other than where i say it was

5835178 they were saying things like are you sure the plane didnt land at reagan airport and they set off a bomb they kept coming up with all these scenarios first walter is not a cit witness second is that really what happened aldo it is an absolute lie and a character assassination attempt by mike walter that we were there to try and prove a plane did not hit we were open to things on our first trip when we met him and were dealing with the fact there was a large twin engine on next to columbia pike this had already caused us to readjust our beliefs and research we were there to learn the true flight path and truth about what happened at the pentagon no matter where it led us mike walter did not see the plane descend from over the potomac river we have no idea why nick added this unless mike walter added this which would be another change to his story craig asked permission to record mike walter at his house and he said ok yet mike walter decided to leave this part out ocweekly where did you see the plane

5835190 oh they didnt cause that she was only going like 2 miles an hour it look like she fell on her own we asked her if she was ok
5835191 are you kidding me she was flat out on the ground what makes you think shed be ok and she told me that it was because of the guys coming at her in her lane that caused her to go off the path and crash

5835198 a number of students contacted us at the office by telephone and e mail asking us about their admissions
5835199 we were trying to find them on the system trying to help them with their inquiry but the numbers didnt match up the names didnt match up the dates of birth didnt match and some of the courses werent true either
5835200 then we tried to get more information from them a number of students sent the letter to us and we could see that it was fraudulent
5835201 they had paid money for the letter to someone in nigeria
5835202 i strongly urge applicants to select their educational consultant or agent very carefully and if possible contact the university directly to find out who the officially appointed agents are

5835208 yaradua administration lacks the political will to fight corruption because of the way and manner some corrupt nigerians are having a field day in the day to day administration of the government as well as the deployment of economic and financial crimes commission efcc officers who were not only the pride of the nigeria police force but the entire country in its onerous task of fighting the endemic scourge in the nigerian society

5835259 we understand that the operators of wild rivers and camp james are still searching for a new home and that the search hasnt progressed as quickly as everybody had hoped
5835260 there would be a big focus on the science of water conservation and principles of sustainability seeing how water is used and re used
5835261 as far as i know there is nothing like it in the country

5835264 it is very easy to lambast children in need for this but the terrorists will use anything to raise money for their cause so we have to be extremely careful about approaches from groups which may be fronts for terrorism
5835265 we must never be complacent about that terrorists operate worthy causes can be misled by potential terrorists
5835266 it beggars belief that a charity promoted at licence fee payers expense paid money to dubious organisations without ensuring they did not have extremist links
5835267 people imagine their money goes to genuine good causes not to organisations apparently frequented by fanatics
5835268 there needs to be proper checks and balances in place to make sure no other grants are being given to places peddling extremist views
5835269 im incredibly concerned that we did make an award to leeds community school over nine years ago
5835270 any allegation that any funding weve given to any project has been misused and not used to change the lives of disadvantaged children and young people makes me concerned and very sad
5835271 we take the trust that the public puts in bbc children in need and the fact that they provide us with their finding extremely seriously and im incredibly concerned
5835272 i can reassure the british public that we are very careful in who we fund and this allegation is a very rare one for us but one that causes a great deal of concern
5835273 the small grants made by bbc children in need to leeds community school were given in good faith in 1998 and 1999
5835274 although this is a serious matter we have not seen any evidence that the money they received was used for terrorist activity if bbc children in need has been a victim of fraud in this case it will be a matter for the police
5835275 it is also disappointing to see him take on and support bushs war in iraq even stating we might be there for another 100 years for me john represents the entrenched and bankrupt policies of washington as usual the past 7 years have proven to be disastrous for our country and i believe johns views on war foreign policy economics environment health care education national infrastructure and other important areas are much the same as those of the bush administration
5835276 the convention will offer a series of contrasts and comparisions of the mccain record so voters can see how clearly the choice will be in november
5835277 the convention will also introduce senator obama to the country but it will make sure to convey strongly the differences and choices obamas campaign presents over mccains
5835278 for three decades as our energy crisis grew decision making in washington has been rigged against our national interests and the interests of american consumers
5835279 and for almost that long senator mccain has been part of the problem for decades he has stood with the big oil companies and voted against the development of the alternative energy we need
5835280 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
5835281 he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that
5835282 they do not feel like theyre slipping in the polls but they just think they need a clear definition of mccain supporting bush economic policies as well as being totally a d c figure
5835283 he needs to do it because if you dont fight back voters think you wont fight for them
5835284 therefore you have to do it to win their support the benefit outweighs the cost
5835285 typically you would want the status quo of this campaign to continue in a pro democrat year in the polls its risky they must have polled this and focus grouped it

5835296 this picture is of a construction area that is not taped off it has no caution tape so kids and other people can walk right underneath the ladder these people could be injured and the construction company isnt sensitive to that

5835303 the event was a huge success the burlington community elected officials and area groups all convened in battery park to take part from the large crowd that attended it is very clear that burlington wants to step it up on action to prevent climate change
5835304 we had several great speakers at the event in burlington but the turn out was not as great as i expected my question is this why didnt the organizers do more advertising in local newspapers radio stations and t v stations there were more people shopping on church st than participating at this important event

5835333 das hat mich infiziert ich habe mein fahrrad ver u ert mir davon das ticket nach deutschland gekauft seitdem gab es nur einen traum ich wollte olympiasieger werden
5835334 ich esse schnell ich fahre gern schnell auto nach olympia will ich auch schnell fliegen ich mache demn chst einen flugschein
5835335 die tiere kamen in den 50er jahren als blinde passagiere mit schiffen aus asien sie vermehren sich hier immer besser
5835336 wenn sie das wasser verlassen zeugt das oft von sauerstoffmangel
5835337 heute morgen dachte ich warum hat mein junge blo so viel pech und jetzt das es ist unglaublich
5835338 morgens als susann losging sagte sie dass sie abends was sch nes f r uns kochen wird
5835339 ich stand drei stunden an ihrem bett dann starb sie
5835340 ich fuhr zu ihrem grab nach zwickau und erz hlte es ihr nur wegen ihr wollte ich deutscher werden
5835341 ich kann verstehen wenn manche menschen nach so einem schicksalsschlag alkoholiker werden
5835342 healthy food and healthy communities forging the farm to cafeteria link
5835343 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5835344 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5835345 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5835346 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5835347 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5835348 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5835349 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5835350 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5835351 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5835352 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5835353 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5835354 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5835355 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5835356 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5835357 katrina is not just bad luck natures occasional surprise thrust on an unsuspecting humanity make no mistake about it we created this monster storm
5835358 most new ventures begin with dissatisfaction with the current options and this project is no different the idea to open a retail food cooperative has been in the making for the past couple of years and last semester jane engelman and i decided to make it more than just an idea
5835359 so whats wrong with that when food is not traceable if it makes people sick or is not of a high quality there is no one to confront or to hold accountable our population is growing but the problem is not a lack of food instead of inventing new technologies to increase productivity we need to alter the current global food system to give everyone access to local food supporting a bioregional approach
5835360 think globally act locally a food co op is one solution to our problems
5835361 what this says to me is that the courts are catching up with climate change and the law is catching up with climate change
5835362 climate change has ushered in a whole new era of judicial review
5835363 its not just the universitys marching band its northern nevadas marching band and were very grateful for the major stepping up at a time we are making huge cuts through out the university
5835364 we want to get with the marching band and let them know they are loved in this community
5835365 we need the people out there to help us with 5 or a nickel whatever they can send send it so eventually we can endow it and help the marching band so it goes on
5835366 as students and employees of green mountain we all have an obligation to watch out for our own and make sure they are taken care of
5835367 we can do this by making sure all employees at green mountain make a minimum of a living wage
5835368 this is not a lofty aspiration and it is disheartening that all the people at our school do not make this
5835369 we currently pride ourselves on our environmental mission but it seems misplaced if it is not combined with a strong social effort and the place to start is with our own staff we cannot be worried about the problems of others if we are not taking care of our own
5835370 a living wage would benefit the campus reputation tremendously the school would be able to advertise and campaign on such issues
5835371 if we say anything our jobs are on the line
5835372 in normal years the pacific ocean area of high pressure covers the whole of japan but this year its power is weak while cool air enters the air there is still damp warm air underneath so atmospheric conditions become unstable making it easy for thunderclouds to develop
5835373 in mid august when there was a lot of heavy rain and lightning strikes there were over 10 inquiries a day
5835374 at this time last year there had only been a few inquiries
5835375 the only response to counter lightning surges is to turn off the power and unplug the equipment if you hear thunder
5835376 dont expect exports without carbon pricing to get in free
5835377 im not saying that anyone would be forced to do anything because im a federalist and believe in the rights of states but at the same time theres already been discussion amongst the states and i believe that more discussion amongst the governors is probably something that everybody wants us to do
5835378 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue
5835379 there are vulnerabilities all around the australian coastline she said
5835380 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible
5835381 this really is very early work and many more factors need to be taken into account before we have concrete projections she said
5835382 it is going to be a negative story leading to damage of assets and loss of value
5835383 the evidence over the past 12 to 18 months suggests that we have underestimated how fast this aspect of the earths system can change he said
5835384 most complex and difficult challenge we have faced as a species
5835385 in the 21st century a sea level rise of at least 0 5 metres is a certainty a rise of 1 to 1 5 metres is more likely while a rise of up to four metres this century is possible he said
5835386 the pressing reality of climate change is upon us and all the evidence points to coastlines being the most vulnerable she said adding that there would be considerable damage to coastal settlements in particular aboriginal communities
5835387 we are strongly of the view that ret is very likely to result in abatement that is at higher costs than would otherwise be necessary to meet our emissions reductions targets the groups chief executive heather ridout said
5835388 i want to make very clear that the renewable energy target was a very clear election commitment to the australian people by the rudd labor government and its a commitment we will be meeting senator wongsaid in sydney
5835389 we believe it is important for the government to provide incentives to the market to invest in renewable energy so that future generations of australians have a range of clean energy options available to them she said
5835390 we remain committed to ensuring that 20 per cent of australias energy comes from renewable sources by 2020
5835391 we hope that displaying carbon footprints will raise awareness among consumers as well as companies of their emissions and motivate them to emit less c02
5835392 the surveys core result is that people care about their communities and express the desire to see government action taken toward local and national issues
5835393 people are hesitant to support efforts concerning global issues even though they believe that environmental quality is poorer at the global level than at the local and national level this is surprising given the media attention that global warming has recently received and reflects the division of opinion about the severity of climate change
5835394 americans are clearly most concerned about pollution issues that might affect their personal health or the health of their families
5835395 we connected the dotss to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
5835396 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
5835397 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
5835398 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
5835399 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
5835400 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere
5835401 as wed expected in applying our model increased smoke from the fires created clouds rife with a more pronounced radiative effect rich with human caused aerosols that absorbed sunlight warmed the local atmosphere and blocked evaporation this led to reduced cloud cover over the amazon
5835402 and its encouraging to know the science behind our model should stand no matter the region
5835403 harvesting californias renewable energy resources a green jobs business plan was released friday by the center for energy efficiency and renewable technologies a sacramento based nonprofit
5835404 we used to have this season from october to april where we had a chance for a storm
5835405 when you pull the storm track north it takes the storms with it
5835406 during the period its raining less it also tends to be warmer than it used to be
5835407 were starting to see the impacts of climate change in the late winter and early spring particularly in the southwest its a season specific kind of drought
5835408 were used to thinking about climate change as happening sometime in the future to someone else but this is right here and affects us now the future is here
5835409 its very rare that you get this distribution by chance
5835410 thousands upon thousands of jobs in the u s rely on that oil
5835411 and 25 percent of all of our untapped resources are there thats a big deal
5835412 and were seeing tremendous interest in getting canadian crude into the philadelphia market
5835413 we looked at whether canada could reduce exports for the sake of conservation or environmental policy or even for household heating we cannot
5835414 and figuring out how we can make this work for all people
5835415 the canadians might look for other options if we became difficult customers
5835416 if it turns out that these technologies dont advance and the only way to produce these resources would be at a significant penalty to climate change then we dont believe that those resources are going to be part of the long term future
5835417 there is a huge infrastructure investment being made in a fuel that in our view is taking us in the wrong direction its making it more difficult for us to fully address the global warming issue
5835418 i think our first step should be to get the united states of america fully engaged
5835419 what is heartening on that question is that both candidates have indicated that they will be moving on this and with an ambitious set of targets
5835420 there is no way the first world can solve this problem alone even if the united states comes in
5835421 the solar bonus scheme will boost our use of renewable energy encourage energy efficiency and stimulate the solar power industry in queensland
5835422 itll help people save money save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions
5835423 households and small businesses will receive credits on their electricity bill for any additional power they generate through their solar systems that is fed into the electricity grid
5835424 its estimated the scheme could save consumers more than 25 percent off their annual electricity bill depending on how energy efficient they are in their home
5835425 the sole multilateral environmental agreement on land and soil degradation
5835426 a platform to address the important issue of climate change and soil
5835427 we have had complaints about connectivity in the netherlands but have not had more complaints than usual for a 3g phone in germany our technicians said today apple has issued a software update but it is too early to tell if the problems are solved
5835428 i think its a good idea theres nothing wrong with it
5835429 i think it will be more effective because people can actually look at them and get the time to read what it says and absorb what it says
5835430 i ate ramen noodles and so did everyone i know when we graduated my friends and i may have wanted to get good jobs and make some money but unspoken our goal was to be able to afford to eat something other than those wavy noodles
5835431 you feel really put out when you cant have your starbucks mocha latte every morning
5835432 you feel like you are going way above and beyond by working until 5 30 after 5 is
5835433 a boss who gives you an assignment and lets you run with it
5835434 i have to feel that the world is becoming a better place because i am doing this work i dont have to be saving lives necessarily but i have to be giving the world something that it needs i dont want to invent and produce widgets and then convince people that they need them for example i want to create and protect beauty and civility i want to feel each and every day that i have had a part in the positive evolution of the human race i want to leave a mark of value
5835435 a great boss will recognize your strengths and build on them rather than force you to play to your weaknesses a great boss will also be a teacher who guides the way while allowing you to step up to challenges with the confidence that you wont be left to flounder on your own a great boss wants you to succeed even if it means youll be promoted away from his or her department
5835436 involves a fun working environment that focuses on the creative side of business without forgetting the bottom line a job with that focus allows workers to put in their eight hours and more because they love the job
5835437 the perfect job is built on creative energy that drives people to not dread the workweek but to embrace it
5835438 i find that i need verbal and monetary recognition i never realized that this would be important to me i actually pursued a masters degree in social work which demonstrates my lack of financial motive
5835439 just as you have a pet peeve flip flops i have one dress codes at my perfect job people would judge me based on how i behave and what i produce at work not on what im wearing
5835440 i dont want to fake it at work i want to thrive at a job because im good at it i dont want to think that that doesnt matter that all people really care about is whether i look the role my personality is a valuable asset to my job i dont have to strongly separate my real life and my work life or inhabit two personalities
5835441 its a chance to learn and practice the skills you need to get someone to pay you to work for them
5835442 as time went by they were more willing to give information and we were able to get the case charged
5835443 by the time i went back there there was screaming and shooting it was unbelievable
5835444 i think the message is that we arent going to give up on solving these cases

5835449 i was not very hopeful about the saddleback civil forum on the presidency held at the california megachurch last saturday night in the first place i am not really comfortable with the idea of hosting such a politically charged event in a church no matter how the event is planned and projected once the event starts it can turn into something far more politically volatile than planned
5835450 we use loads of energy in the home to keep things cool give us heat and light and to watch tv plus we use lots of water to clean our teeth flush the loo and wash ourselves and our clothes so today i went to wales to the centre for alternative technology cat to find out how i can be greener in my home eco friendly houses at cat there was an ideal environmentally friendly house it had low energy electrical appliances as well as food that had been organically or locally produced the most exciting thing i was shown was an electric car that ran on renewable energy its much friendlier to the environment than a petrol or diesel run car i also met a little boy lexi who lives at the centre his family is living an environmentally friendly lifestyle he showed me his toilet that doesnt use water its a compost toilet he also showed me his bath in the summer it gets its heat from solar panels and in the winter there is a fire which burns wood to generate heat my family one of the biggest areas we can work on in my family is trying to buy locally produced food were also going to prepare food using fresh ingredients rather than buying ready made things todays shown me how important it is to do that
5835451 im going on my first business trip next week and its a doozy four weeks in zimbabwe and namibia i will be meeting with people a lot more senior than myself and am worried about screwing up in some way or another

5835454 think as a guest and assimilate into the culture of the country youre visiting take time to understand business practices and social etiquette in the country you are heading to
5835455 since youre not a seasoned traveler with lots of frequent flier miles when they say get to the airport extra early they are talking directly to you
5835456 there could be lines at every airport and at every turn you make check in security baggage check passport check so if youre not familiar with the airport or how far away your gate is check in and go directly to your gate then look for food or a place to read for the inexperienced traveler better safe than sorry
5835457 it gives you a chance to adjust to the time zone and get a nights sleep before your meeting unless you have no problem sleeping on an airplane arriving jet lagged and sleep deprived in the morning will make your first day difficult
5835458 being overdressed is better than being underdressed even in hawaii
5835459 when in doubt choose the suit and choose clothes that will not wrinkle garfield amp marks has a huge collection of suits that are great for long flights and look nice even after being packed for hours in the suitcase

5835465 kind of excited to try out simplify media at work
5835466 to see it in real life and that it exists its just its just unbelievable it really is
5835467 to think back and i made up a character you know and just made it up but suddenly a man came named henry winkler and he made this character real
5835468 perhaps a conversation either with your boss or with an hr representative might be your first step

5835471 consumers have embraced the dvd format like no other technology and invested in large libraries of their favorite movies as the market moves towards high definition xde lets them experience their existing dvd library and the tens of thousands of dvd titles in a whole new way
5835472 though i did not understand it at the outset of the project it made sense by the end that one person could not excel at all of the jobs equally that someone might self select another workplace entirely
5835473 many front line jobs are ones that job applicants choose by matching themselves up with the companys culture and those companies that promote this self selection process are often able to better serve customers
5835474 when you buy a latte at starbucks your view of the company its brand is largely shaped by the person who serves you
5835475 you may have a vague sense of the founders story but by and large its these front line employees who connect you to the larger corporation
5835476 i went into this project pretty much unaware that these companies were looking for different types of people
5835477 i had imagined that the employer was mostly seeking to weed out bad apples but its not just good worker versus bad worker that they look for theyre searching for a select menu of traits they have identified and can change as needed
5835478 the hope is that the system will allow employers to clone their best most reliable people
5835479 with no great perceived effort on its part ups had inculcated me
5835480 a year later id pull on the warm brown quilted vest and feel a sense of power and place
5835481 confessions of a recruiting director the insiders guide to landing your first job
5835482 so many people think everything in a job interview is a trick question
5835483 interviewing is the step that most people think theyre good at but theyre not
5835484 the right job right now the complete tool kit for finding your perfect career
5835485 if it says they want someone with managerial experience be prepared to be asked about your managerial experience
5835486 the r sum is what i call the whats in an interview i want to know the whys and the hows a single bullet point on your r sum might inspire an interviewer to talk for 10 minutes
5835487 you should absolutely know what an employer does how it was founded and what its goals are before you walk in the door
5835488 even if its a nonprofit you still need to know what their funding model is
5835489 i wanted to crack the lid off of all those elusive jobs that get all the conversation at dinner parties
5835490 although most experts will tell you that meteorology is tough to break into because its such a small field the educational barriers to entry are rather low when compared with many other scientific professions
5835491 entry level forecasters working for the federal government for example must have just a bachelors degree as a television weathercaster you might not even need to get a bachelors provided you perform well on camera and know how to get the information that results in accurate forecasts
5835492 these individuals prefer to work on their own and despise inefficiency and bureaucracy the data head is happiest setting concrete goals and achieving them they dont like to be micromanaged and will pursue their plans to the point of being stubborn
5835493 all of these people have one thing in common and that is persistence
5835494 i have been in my job for 16 years and have seen upper management come and go five times
5835495 what i have learned is that their decisions are often wrong or based on their own personal biases it is often far better to stay and seek legal advisement and document document document dont let incompetent management and unethical and often illegal policies drive you from a rewarding well paying career
5835496 as department chair i get lots of r sum s many from people hoping to switch careers
5835497 all too often theres a whiff of condescension from such candidates and they dont make the call pile americans have weird views of teachers either they regard us with contempt or less often through a lens of romanticism that distorts the reality of a rewarding job that requires hard work creativity and diverse skills that have to withstand the test of a tough audience every day
5835498 people bump into women in airports and they the women apologize i see this all the time everywhere someone out of your department waylaying you for additional work should not be told you are sorry not to do it
5835499 i really think women give up some authority by frequently apologizing
5835500 to me the problem isnt the verbiage but the process which is as byzantine as ever despite the office of personnel managements claim to have streamlined it and its stated desire to emulate the private sector with regard to hiring
5835501 it is absurd how long it takes to properly prepare for and submit a federal job application this process deters the best and brightest who might be inclined to apply for federal jobs but dont because they either lack the time to apply or are unwilling to put themselves through that process
5835502 one should not have to build a r sum in the usajobs system
5835503 they used to allow one to simply upload a r sum and this would be in their system until edited or replaced now if the agency uses usajobs one has to monotonously rewrite ones information into the usajobs r sum builder this is nonsense
5835504 many jobs are listed applicants apply and then the positions are delisted often for lack of funding
5835505 they should not list positions until the funding is guaranteed and the agency is certain that it wants to hire someone it is absurd to put applicants through the hassle of applying for a federal job only to then eliminate the vacancy
5835506 there has been substantial literature in recent years on the federal retirement tsunami that is supposed to come soon
5835507 the feds however either arent truly concerned or are simply too oblivious to reality to understand how normal non fed people view them
5835508 i have a ahmadinejad says turkey engaged in friendly effort turkeys efforts on tehrans contested nuclear program were defined as a

5835512 im not one of the nras favorites although i do think there is a second amendment which doesnt mean you can have any gun at any time
5835513 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
5835514 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
5835515 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
5835516 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
5835517 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
5835518 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
5835519 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
5835520 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
5835521 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
5835522 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
5835523 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
5835524 i started out as an unpaid intern with starlight childrens foundation a few months after graduation and was hired on full time after a month
5835525 four years after graduation i read about a seminar called from secretary to vice president at the vienna womens center so many women come to d c and still do with their undergrad degree and begin work as executive assistants as they are called now the panelists were women who started their careers as secretaries and quickly moved up the ladder in the nonprofit world it was awe inspiring within three months of the seminar i was working as a director for a nonprofit in the education area it wasnt simple i did my research for making the transition immediately after the seminar i enrolled in the american society of association executives certificate programs education first then marketing i began to earn certifications including advanced certification administrator where one requirement is developing and launching a certification program certified meeting professional since networking events are common in the nonprofit world and certified association executive which is looked upon by many as a requirement for becoming an executive director of an association
5835526 i began my career in journalism edited a magazine then moved into corporate work managing large marketing and communications departments for 15 years i left my last company 20 years ago to pursue a career managing foundations and helping nonprofit organizations in delaware my transition was facilitated by a generous stock option plan in my experience most former corporate people who end up working in the nonprofit field do so after they have had a certain degree of success that allows them to follow their dreams or priorities this is true both for nonprofit employees and board volunteers
5835527 i was a cpa for grant thornton when i started volunteering at a homeless shelter once a week i absolutely loved it it became the best part of my week i did this for several months when the staff at the nonprofit approached me about an opening for an office manager i hadnt thought about switching careers but i was enjoying the volunteer experience so much that i decided to go for it i eventually moved to a direct service position with a different nonprofit where i helped prepare low income individuals for the workforce i started my own nonprofit that later became an affiliate of goodwill of greater washington where i became vice president
5835528 i had worked for several years as a journalist before wanting to get into pr and marketing a year into my job search i accepted a position at a very small architectural firm as the only pr marketing person we bid on a job at the ashrae headquarters but didnt get it i kept checking out their web site for no real reason one day i saw a job opening there for a pr assistant and decided to go for it although the hiring manager was not someone i had met previously in the bidding process at my former job my knowledge of the organization definitely helped
5835529 i became interested in nonprofit work after an internship at the childrens defense fund the fall after college graduation after that experience i was hooked i had several internships including two in graduate school and then was an associate before getting to a director level
5835530 get a financial life personal finance in your twenties and thirties
5835531 traditional degrees for nontraditional students how to earn a top diploma from americas great colleges at any age
5835532 there are times when i feel like shes showing me up in front of others in particular my boss
5835533 well be in a discussion about doing something and as im thinking through the situation she immediately jumps in and volunteers to do it thats fine if thats what she wants to do i have enough to do as it is
5835534 however recently she asked me if she could take over the monthly meeting we have with the support staff she likes making fancy fliers and agendas bulletin boards coordinating birthday celebrations etc i said sure if she would like to do that this again was in front of my boss
5835535 because this rumor is coming from my own colleagues im not sure what to think of it my gut tells me to forget it dont worry about it but at the same time i dont want to lose the respect of my colleagues
5835536 in many ways the work world is no different from junior high school
5835537 people spread rumors gossip is abundant there is the competitive edge and insecurity instead of worrying about whether other students think our clothes are cool or our shoes are hip we worry about whether our colleagues think we are competent whether we are admired or looked down upon
5835538 i work with ceos of some of the top companies in the world as well as young people who are in their first job and interestingly the same insecurities show up
5835539 focus on her work her strengths her interests and her relationships within the workplace
5835540 if her colleagues are going to respect her it will be for her own merits
5835541 will feel best and have the strongest foundation to stand on if she comes from a place of sincerity building confidence based on what she has to offer
5835542 every monday afternoon ray asked me what i thought was important
5835543 on monday he would speak up first and raise the issues he had pumped me for the day before
5835544 it is the national system that will win the olympic cold war
5835545 post people are still contributing their thoughts on what sessions and events you might want to attend at the annual meeting
5835546 if you want to be happy at work the first step is realizing that your career is worth planning for
5835547 a lot of people are afraid of hearing the word no
5835548 instead of asking for something they just resent not getting it
5835549 we dont really attach any baggage to the word girls
5835550 all of our books were inspired by our professional experiences
5835551 whether you notice or not you negotiate almost every single day
5835552 weaving in and out of traffic is a negotiation with other drivers navigating busy supermarkets passing chores back and forth with your partner all unremarkable yet familiar negotiations that hopefully dont get confrontational
5835553 most co workers are not your friends so throw out the notion of hurting their feelings
5835554 keep the emotion out of your voice get your facts right be willing to listen and offer a solution to fix it from your end
5835555 400 best big companies in america is a global enterprise providing must have content and services for academic professional scientific technical medical and consumer markets
5835556 one day in prayer all by myself i asked myself the question what if its all not true
5835557 it was an earth shaking moment of spiritual terror such a profound experience it was such a sense of loss i felt my faith leaving me and never coming back
5835558 it quickly got completely out of my control now no one wants to call themselves a mormon filmmaker because youre associating yourself with a genre thats fallen into disrepute its like having porn on your r sum
5835559 winds of plague as individuals have been hit very hard recently by a very selfish act committed by our long time drummer jeff tenney we are disgusted and very disappointed in his actions however we as a band are not going to let this slow us down a few drummers from the tour have stepped up and are helping us finish the remainder of the thrash and burn run we are currently on the search for a new drummer
5835560 we wanted to put careers in context to show what real careers look like
5835561 unless living at home is a financial necessity for the sake of your career move on
5835562 if you involve your parents too heavily in your career search you may find them also assuming responsibility for your career choice and their choice may be very different from yours
5835563 you have to know what you want to do and then find a way to do it rather than commit to a professional education and then figure out whether its a necessary step toward your current career objectives too often graduate school or professional school is seen as a default when you cant think of anything else to do
5835564 doing so gives you at least eight people at graduation who know you very well and can support your dreams seek them out invite them to lunch let them get to know you without a notebook open in front of you
5835565 she was only in day care a few hours a day which let her get used to it and let us get used to it
5835566 i find that i have to be so much more organized
5835567 when i was not working i could always say to myself ill go do that later now even though i work 20 hours i have to schedule everything if i dont it all slips by
5835568 we pared down a lot of stuff so that we could have more time together
5835569 as a stay at home mom i just did it all no questions
5835570 i have figured out how much it costs me per hour and how many hours it would take me to do the same thing if i could find the time to do it and there is no contest it is worth it
5835571 when a supervisor or a boss hurls a litany of complaints at you with little warning which is more likely to occur if you wait until your year end review to get feedback from your boss
5835572 if a situation with a male co worker leads you to contemplate quitting your job or transferring divisions or is preventing you from operating at full throttle its probably time to seek an intervention
5835573 hey im cute why not work that for all its worth
5835574 oprah winfrey certainly didnt get where she is today because she used her sexuality and shes not the only one
5835575 by staying in a job that makes you miserable or in which your skills and talents arent utilized you are losing precious months or even years that could be spent in a job for which youre better suited there is a difference between paying your dues and working at a job you hate
5835576 when you keep your head down and do your work and expect that someone will notice you and put a tiara on your head
5835577 i just knew i wasnt going to feel comfortable leaving him
5835578 i applied for a job a couple of years ago got it and then turned it down for another job i also was offered now im looking to move on and the hiring manager i still keep in touch with her for the job i turned down has contacted me about a position opening in their office
5835579 im also in the running for another job at a completely different company that is more interesting to me im running out of reasons and ways to put off the hiring manager i know so i can hold out for this other job i may or may not get i feel so guilty
5835580 there is definitely a right way to do it and a wrong way
5835581 agencies large and small continue to choose propertyroom com over the old fashioned live auction
5835582 beyond the superior financial returns the internet increases public access to public goods our shoppers finish dinner get the kids ready for bed and then bid on a police auction
5835583 this time we will perform in los angeles in venues dedicated to underground metal
5835584 it is the correct setting and the correct circumstances for us and we are greatly anticipating these shows
5835585 if the sec determines that monies should be paid by citigroup or other financial institutions as a result of these allegations the sec should consider the potential tax deductibility of these payments by citigroup or other financial institutions when determining the appropriate amount of such payments
5835586 the standard practice is to settle the matter by a payment which is not delineated at a penalty and does not acknowledge it is a penalty merely a settlement of the claim by the regulator
5835587 those payments are deductible for tax purposes and the regulators like it that way as it makes it easier to settle the matter
5835588 as part of the settlement you have to pay a certain amount but theyre not laying out which part of that is restitution or fines the banks can decide by themselves
5835589 companies will have an incentive to push for settlements that favor their ability to deduct whatever payment they have to make thus reducing the overall impact on the company by making sure that the payment amounts are not described as a fine or similar penalty paid to the government for violation of any law
5835590 help us transition to ifrs rather than creating new rules that may be obsolete in the near future
5835591 as convergence is likely inevitable and near term we believe issuance of new guidance prior to agreement between the board and the international accounting standards board should be deferred
5835592 w e believe that implementing the proposed statement prior to completely harmonizing international accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on the u s capital markets
5835593 the current direction of the board is to converge with ifrs and focus on principle based standards we do not believe this proposal is within the spirit of that goal
5835594 it is very important its necessary that we continue to maintain u s gaap
5835595 the null results in this and other homocysteine lowering b vitamin intervention trials suggest that homocysteine is not a modifiable cause but rather a biological marker of cardiovascular disease risk
5835596 at this stage use of b vitamin supplements to improve prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease is not justified
5835597 dane county clean air coalition partners have taken substantial steps over the past four years implementing voluntary air pollution reduction programs to keep our air healthy
5835598 our proactive preventative effort is important for our health our environment and our economy this challenge further increases the importance of reducing pollution from transportation and commuter rail will only help these efforts
5835599 madison and dane county are doing more than ever to combat air pollution and air quality is improving as a result nevertheless in light of more stringent public health standards we must work even harder to ensure that we are doing everything possible to protect the health of all our citizens
5835600 we have made progress in improving the quality of air we breathe in dane county and throughout wisconsin but there is more work to be done
5835601 youve got to be kidding me only player personnel in the dugout
5835602 i wont say that women belong in the kitchen but they dont belong in the dugout
5835603 you know im only teasing i love you gals out there always have
5835604 they have a grin on their faces because they would be excited about doing
5835605 yeah guys that was a great tackle good hittin out there
5835606 its a sense of sadness because after every game last year and after the first two preseason games i had to look at mr blank and know that he deserves a winning team and he deserves a championship
5835607 i was here and couldnt make it happen its kind of sad for me leaving
5835608 now were calling these teams and kind of narrowing the scope
5835609 joe has been so productive somebody like joe and a team with a need should be a perfect fit
5835610 it was just mentally wearing him down more than physically
5835611 im disappointed that joe didnt get an opportunity to compete because of his injury in training camp and his choice not to come to otas
5835612 we really didnt get an opportunity for him to compete were going to move forward we feel very comfortable about the receiving corps that we have i wish joe the best of luck as he moves on
5835613 we couldnt change something we couldnt control the petrino thing imploded on us it wasnt the falcons fault and it wasnt joes fault it just all fell apart he planned on retiring with atlanta
5835614 you play awhile and youth comes along its their time you dont rebuild a team with veteran players i do think you can rebuild with a veteran player who can still play i know i can still play
5835615 this king loves jews therefore he asked the jews living in bahrain to request jews living in israel to return
5835616 king al khalifa and bahraini prime minister shaikh khalifa bin salman al khalifa met in london with a group of expatriate bahraini jews who currently live in the united kingdom the meeting was highly unusual for an arab monarch although in may of this year king al khalifa became the only arab ruler to appoint a jewish woman as an ambassador
5835617 theres a lot more that needs to be done to get smart and healthful choices at restaurants for kids
5835618 theres a lot more that needs to be done to get smart and healthful choices at restaurants for kids
5835619 a lot of times the adult menu was better than all the beige items being served to kids french fries chicken nuggets grilled cheese
5835620 the average american driving down the highway doesnt have any place that offers a wide variety of low calorie highly nutritious foods
5835621 our goal isnt to advocate or legitimize any fast food diet but rather to help families make the smartest decision possible in any given eating situation including the rather grim ones that many chain restaurants offer
5835622 the best part of the book is the section about menu options at chain restaurants
5835623 parents can take this book with them when they go out to dinner
5835624 but some information in the processed food section seems ill advised for instance the book says get your kids hooked on dark chocolate at an early age i dont think thats something parents want to do
5835625 for toothaches kids may need dental attention not something out of the pantry
5835626 we need a pepfar presidents emergency plan for aids relief for orphans in the world
5835627 i think its something that we should sit down and figure out working between nongovernmental organizations international institutions the us government try to figure out what can we do
5835628 i think you know im often a critic of president bush but i think the pepfar program has saved lives and has done very good work and he deserves enormous credit for that
5835629 we also need to make adoption a lot easier in this country
5835630 thats why so many people now go to other countries to adopt children
5835631 we added the national sales office in miami in response to the growing account base and demands of meeting professionals and incentive specialists in florida so this is an expansion of our southeast a l h i team
5835632 what kind of stupid question is that get outta here
5835633 if you really rated steinway and the boys would have been playing it when you walked in
5835634 this is where president bush stays when hes in st louis
5835635 hey ill just skip that one today or maybe not come back to re index it for a few months since it never changes
5835636 my advice would be 1 to avoid over syndicating the articles that you write and 2 if you do syndicate content make sure that you include a link to the original content that will help ensure that the original content has more pagerank which will aid in picking the best documents in our index
5835637 dream as if youll live forever live as if youll die today

5835639 dont you dare take that job bostons a terrible city its gonna fail its going to ruin you why would you do this why would you give up television
5835640 we have held talks with the chinese for a year and the terms of the deal were changed to a service contract the chinese have agreed on that with a value of 1 2 billion
5835641 for whatever reason i didnt say it and i should have
5835642 get him out of here i dont care if you have to give him my police escort get him on a plane to melbourne get him out of here now
5835643 the gay rights activist peter tatchell claims the vatican is promoting
5835644 the vatican has asked for the body of john henry newman to be transferred from his grave at a cemetery in rednal near birmingham to the oratory church in edgbaston prior to an expected decision by the church to declare newman

5835646 a man that doesnt spend time with his family can never be a real man
5835647 is vengeance going to bring your son back to you
5835648 the incident has to be taken in the context of what was going on while i was in yerushalyim for 5 weeks during the
5835649 not going to shul today they need to sleep in and catch up on their rest because their rebbe had let them out to go rioting almost every night this week
5835650 the basic issues are what do you want to get out of it why do you want to exercise
5835651 rather than saying i want to get in better shape which is a goal thats too nebulous you should really define what that is that you want to be able to run four miles without stopping for instance
5835652 once you do that you can start to break it down
5835653 what youre thinking of is punching the clock hitting that minimum target each day
5835654 if you do the same activity over and over at a set rate once the cells in your muscles or bones adapt to being able to do that easily they dont adapt any further
5835655 in order to get further improvement you need to provide additional stimuli by increasing the frequency intensity and or duration
5835656 this gives your body sufficient time to adapt to and recover from the additional level of stress and allows you to avoid significant muscle soreness
5835657 the feedback is based on the assumption that youre not leaning onto the machines handrails
5835658 if youre offloading 20 to 30 percent of your body weight you can reduce the calorie burn by 20 to 30 percent getting into this whole numbers mind set can be counterproductive
5835659 if you aim for that zone range you can then cross train between different machines
5835660 balance is an important piece for improving performance and its very protective
5835661 whether youre running doing a layup shot in basketball or kicking a soccer ball youre balancing on one foot
5835662 and most people including athletes have significant balance deficits especially on one leg
5835663 if you can do something equally well on both sides youll be a better athlete
5835664 if you dont have good balance youre going to be injured i guarantee it
5835665 balance is one of the most important and most underemphasized aspects of fitness
5835666 undergoes more force more repetition more risk and the non dominant side is weak
5835667 these issues are neural in their control not muscular and neural patterning happens more quickly

5835670 los principales bancos de inversi n y las entidades financieras internacionales y locales proyectan que per crecer a un ritmo
5835671 think of climbing like sprinting you dont sprint for that long
5835672 its good for the brain good for the heart its good for the bones and good for the soul
5835673 but its a terrible idea macho and asthma dont mix
5835674 you are probably burning more calories when you are actually moving a heavy weight than when you are doing aerobic exercise but you are taking breaks so over 30 minutes the actual number of calories burned doing strength training will be less
5835675 you are limited in the amount of strength training you can do
5835676 ideally you want a combination of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise and moderate intensity strength training but if vigorous aerobic exercise and vigorous weight training went head to head for calories burned vigorous aerobic exercise would win
5835677 most people will eat to compensate for calories burned unless they are very careful
5835678 all movement matters it is the total volume of exercise over the day that is most important both planned exercise and lifestyle activities count
5835679 to burn more calories during exercise you need to increase oxygen consumption another measure of energy expenditure which means you have to work harder
5835680 we always require accommodation especially for those on short term housing licences
5835681 the ghost of barrett deemss wig is scheduled to appear
5835682 the shows are designed to showcase the phenomenal talent that is ever present in the underground music scene we also hope to offer the neighboring communities a fresh alternative to hollywood nightlife
5835683 we are also at the close of our first season and have discovered a goldmine of talented and bankable independent artists
5835684 our goal for next season is to take the show on the road for even wider audiences to enjoy
5835685 there is a lot of powerful music out there and definitely a market for it its not all about entertainment anymore listening to certain types of music is definitely therapeutic much like doing yoga eating well or even taking medicine it can actually make you feel better with no harmful side effects
5835686 our strategy is in forming partnerships the artists and their music are the lifeblood of the company we are merely the vehicle by creating equitable deals we can create an enterprise that serves the needs of a greater common good
5835687 the whole idea is to network and join forces even kevin black president of warner bros records confirmed that we have the talent now we just have to pool our resources to put our own artists out and make the money that the majors are leaving behind
5835688 the shows are designed to introduce new ideas on living happier and healthier lives by controlling our
5835689 we are at the beginning of our first season and are excited about working with an array of talented individuals to further define what has turned out to be our lifes work
5835690 the online digital download store that features the music from many of the artists scheduled for the upcoming series such as darius lux the very unique existence eliot popkin and more
5835691 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great
5835692 yeah baby i got it done yeah im the man
5835693 we showed that as a first step it is feasible to do this procedure but the risk of death was about 17 at 30 days but on the other hand we did not have a stroke in anybody so from our point of view this is a necessary first step with a new procedure
5835694 i think the transapical approach at least in my experience is at least as good as the transfemoral approach and is associated with a much lower risk of stroke
5835695 weve had zero strokes in more than 150 patients this is a very very strong argument in favor of transapical
5835696 there are obviously reports in some newspapers and even from the stock market that are pretty negative but i see this completely differently
5835697 first im a positive person but i think our results are positive as well the negative part comes in my opinion from the fact that healthier patients who have good femoral arteries go in the transfemoral arm of these studies the sicker ones those who have more disease go in the transapical arm so the transapical cohort accumulates a higher risk profile and they will get worse results of course at our hospital we have similar outcomes and results are at least as good with transapical
5835698 the results with the transapical procedure arent as good as the femoral so far except at some centers but i think theres a learning curve with these procedures so that people who dont have much experience have some problems with them initially
5835699 i think we were learning a lot about where to position the valve that was clearly one issue we had and resulted in some of the problems and second in retrospect we probably selected some patients for the procedure whom we shouldnt have whom we then subsequently had problems with
5835700 theres no question in my mind that this technology works and the delivery systems and our understanding of the procedure are improving
5835701 there will be a role for this device but these are the early days of a novel technology that is still finding its place thats what the partner trial is for establishing the risk benefit ratio vs the best available alternative
5835702 i really do believe the future will be fully transfemoral
5835703 if the mortality is as rumored then i think its going to be very difficult for transapical to survive
5835704 at centers where surgeons are very strong they will be the gatekeepers for this procedure and the transapical will be the dominant procedure so there will be a negative bias toward using the transfemoral approach
5835705 there is a little bit of investigator pushing going on and i think the surgeons to be honest are pushing subtly toward a transapical approach because they are more involved and they maybe feel a little more comfortable
5835706 whereas cardiologists feel pretty good about the femoral arteries and they say why should we subject the patients to the surgical risk when we can do this transfemorally something we do on a regular basis i think its a disruptive force within the trial and within the use of this technology
5835707 i do know that some of the surgeons who have been doing the transapical procedure have had a little bit of trouble because they werent really skilled with the catheters and wires
5835708 maybe theres a bigger learning curve with the transapical approach because it involves different sheaths different wires and sometimes people with lesser catheter or wire skills are doing those procedures
5835709 if we could somehow disregard all of the transapical data and just focus on the transfemoral i think we would be much better off
5835710 i think introducing this whole transapical approach way downstream from the initial launch of the technology has been very confusing disrupting and challenging for physicians to make sense of things we had a nice thing going we had a nice clean data set the device was in the hands of good clinicians and we had very consistent errors but there are so many variables going into transapical the learning curve different sheaths different wires different ways of sizing the valve different visualization i think weve introduced a whole other level of variables to try to sort out how to make sense of the technology rather than focusing on the original well defined data set that was progressing nicely
5835711 i think they kind of lost their experience during this gap and they had to restart
5835712 you need to do this regularly at our center we now do valve cases one day per week this allows us to retain experience as to how to deal with problems and how to handle very sick patients postoperatively and thats how you obtain better results
5835713 everybody is going to try to second guess what is going to happen but my expectation is that these procedures will continue to have something like a 4 to 7 30 day mortality rate and thats partly going to be dependent on the procedure and the problems we have with doing it and also the patient group that were including
5835714 until now weve been using this procedure in patients who are extremely high risk for surgery
5835715 and the early data seem to show that this procedure might work very well in low risk patients and even be a desirable procedure in patients who are low risk for surgery
5835716 when they see a patient who has no other options they keep extending and extending the limits in higher and higher risk patients ultimately you have to stop and say weve gone too far and pull back to the right population
5835717 i want to start an exercise program i want to stay healthy and uninjured while i do it are there any restrictions i have to follow
5835718 many many people focus their workouts on the muscles in the front of their bodies
5835719 tilts forward even five degrees that is a lot of added pressure your head wont fall off insert relieved cheer here but you will use muscle to hold it up
5835720 you could drop a plumb line from your earlobe and it would hit your shoulder hip knee and ankle
5835721 if you find your shoulder blades pinching in pull the outer sides of your armpits toward each other
5835722 require me to put shoes on change out of my pajamas or leave my living room
5835723 muscles fibers contract instinctively to stabilize the body muscles in the back balance those in the front rest your injury or it will never heal meathead
5835724 whether you are a competitive or recreational runner you should replace your running shoes every 300 to 500 miles
5835725 if the shoe is worn on the outside little toe side of the forefoot you probably supinate
5835726 if it is worn on the inside big toe side you probably pronate roll your foot inward flattening it out
5835727 if you can only do one push up thats a very intense exercise for you
5835728 you wouldnt want to have a heavy lifting day after running 10 miles
5835729 you want to be fully metabolically and neurologically capable for the big stuff whatever activity you do first will have the highest quality
5835730 you have to get to a certain point in your head and then its for real
5835731 its so disturbing when i walk by a store window or any reflective surface and i think who is that chubby girl
5835732 that moment of desire unencumbered by other things may not happen again soon
5835733 he marveled my co worker was sold she signed up for her first prenatal yoga session shortly after that
5835734 indoor cycling is mysterious people dont have a lot of awareness about what exactly it entails
5835735 people think that because the exercise session is on a bike it is only for fit people or elite cyclists but that is not true
5835736 cycling is about attaining and achieving fitness working at a good aerobic pace not walking out and thinking that was so hard
5835737 i was very apprehensive to start cycling at first since it looked so intense and like you had to be in top shape to do it then an instructor told me my only goal was to stay on the bike
5835738 i aim to go about three days a week now because it just gets so addicting and if i dont go i miss it
5835739 diferentes medios televisivos fueron convocados por el general ep francisco vargas vaca jefe de la regi n militar del oriente para presenciar esta pr ctica desarrollada en el cuartel vargas guerra de iquitos

5835745 she stood behind young people who dared to make a difference
5835746 the fact is if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
5835747 you cant throw them away they could be uncle freddys ashes they could come and sue you
5835748 there needs to be a dignified way to finally put these people to rest and allow the funeral homes to do that under the law
5835749 youll hear people say all the time just cremate me and throw me in the river
5835750 the more the word gets out that cremation is not final disposition that something still needs to be done the better off we will be
5835751 i told her what happened she said ill call you back
5835752 it alerts your neighbors that you need help so you can get immediate assistance
5835753 also it directs ems directly to you so theres no more riding by looking for the correct home anymore
5835754 if an ambulance was trying to find you it will be a lot of help
5835755 we just need to get it out there to them
5835756 i read your column and i agree with everyone else you stink
5835757 worked with the officer who stopped me that doesnt mean you wont end up with pixilated privates on
5835758 the runner can more efficiently extract oxygen for use in her lower body muscles and the swimmer has more peripheral adaptation in the upper body
5835759 this is actually how a lot of people become triathletes
5835760 they start to swim to give their body a break from the pounding of running then quickly advance
5835761 janet who works at an ipod accessories warehouse in jessup
5835762 we close the office a bit early and head out in our bosss boat for an afternoon of death tube i e being dragged behind the boat at high speeds on the tube until we are thrown off water skiing and swimming
5835763 i met and became friends with people who didnt work in my department who i would never have gotten to know otherwise
5835764 treat you like adults if you have your work done the attitude was by all means go take a class or run on the nearby capital crescent trail on a nice afternoon
5835765 im less stressed because traffic is lighter during the morning commute
5835766 every other day the computer chimes a reminder to knock out bicep curls triceps pushes and a military lift in 10 minutes without leaving the desk i feel better
5835767 i get home sweaty feeling great and the stress of the day got dropped somewhere back along four mile run
5835768 whatever briley i do supermans all the time and im fine in fact my lower back ripples like a flying cape when i flex
5835769 people bend down to pick up a pen and their back goes and they think that did it but rarely did one episode cause it
5835770 i see this in runners and in people who go out and ride a bicycle 30 miles even though they havent ridden in years
5835771 they go out to play a sport and think they should perform like they did 15 years ago because they still feel the same physically
5835772 before that i ran and biked the running after many years of it i was starting to feel it in my knees and other points rowing is non impact its excellent exercise it works all of the muscle groups its also very technical its like any other sport you have to get very good at it before you get efficient its relaxing at the same time very strenuous
5835773 and whats not to like about getting out on this river at 6 in the morning
5835774 yes it does take longer to recover from an injury
5835775 we had my dad as an example and you tend to do what you are naturally inclined to do
5835776 the beta sdk that were releasing today is the first big step on the sdks road to compatibility with 1 0
5835777 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0 however the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes
5835778 im sorry to say that we had to remove a few things such as the gtalkservice for security reasons and the
5835779 i used to travel to far flung places for my job some of which didnt even have hotels let alone workout facilities
5835780 i wont divulge too many secrets here but well focus on providing simple calling plans integrating all our services into one device with a consistent cross platform interface and making our content and applications mobile
5835781 frankly were in a street fight today for customers in every single aspect of our business from the bells and the satellite guys to the wireless carriers
5835782 its an important innovation a logical business evolution and will maximize the immense power of coxs greatest asset the last mile of our robust broadband network
5835783 the tru2way open cable platform will mean the end of the set top for some consumers
5835784 and new open source applications that tru2way enables will work across every device from any manufacturer further blending the lines between your tv computer and telephone
5835785 being locked to government mandated business practices or chained to programming contract terms set by government arbiters could inflict more harm than good serving only to choke investment and shackling innovation for future generations
5835786 they have been playing an attacking expansive type of game and i think theyll keep going with that mitchell said
5835787 it is up to us to make sure we are on our game with our defensive policies and that sort of thing
5835788 if there is any opportunity for turnovers or things like that we can hopefully sting them back
5835789 with these new elvs it certainly creates a lot more opportunity at full back in terms of counter attack and turn over ball and getting your hands on the ball as much as you can
5835790 certainly late in the halves when the bigger guys are getting fatigued there is some scope there to try and get involved and get a few mismatches
5835791 jimmy horwill and rocky both trained fully so the key now will be how they respond to that deans said
5835792 they had a scrummaging session which is the first one theyve had as well so the fact that theyre out here and doing it is good it means theres a chance but the key will be how they report after that
5835793 we dont want to set it back so that they then need an operation weve got to be sensible about it because theres still footy to come
5835794 if you dont know the system or what youre talking about dont say anything or write anything on it
5835795 we are seeing the public having to make sacrifices and setting priorities and we should be doing the same
5835796 the lancaster bee was the only one that took the time to look at it
5835797 you could have bought a durango like you had for under 20 000 and other like vehicles as well also if you deem something surplus it has to be okayed by the town board
5835798 the town has a procurement policy in place which requires that any purchase over 10 000 be the subject of bid the supervisor should have come to the town board and discussed his proposed purchase that way the board members could have discussed using the state bid and saved 2 385 off the county bid or better yet given the lower state bid prices on other models the board could have used the state bid to purchase a dodge durango 4x4 delivered for 21 046
5835799 following the bid process buying this vehicle we could have saved taxpayers over 11 000 from the cost of the tahoe the same could be said for several other like suv models
5835800 furthermore the town board is charged with the responsibility of deeming what town property is surplus and causing its sale or trade in the supervisor didnt follow state law in regard trading in the 2001 durango
5835801 with only 70 000 miles on it im sure we could have used it somewhere
5835802 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers random house have cancelled another authors novel apparently because of concerns about possible islamic reprisals
5835803 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
5835804 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
5835805 one of the really big publishing houses has backed down
5835806 i felt it my duty to warn the press of the novels potential to provoke anger among some muslims
5835807 it is a good move to lower tensions in multi confessional serbia
5835808 you know some small stuff like um so that lunatic period youre over that now right
5835809 thats why hes not coming into the booth with you
5835810 so tell me is cruise over there in the dannys booth eatin the food and jumpin on the furniture
5835811 you got that academy award for playing ray charles are there any other blind singers youre thinking of playing as you know sort of a sequel
5835812 many tour dates of msg have been confirmed and newly announced on michael schenkers official website also dates of michael schenker with scorpions have been officially confirmed
5835813 its sad because if you look at the list its heavily minority it looks bad
5835814 i think a lot of us would like to take another
5835815 brown cow depending on who you believe it was created by frank wisner in cripple creek
5835816 its sad because if you look at the list its heavily minority it looks bad
5835817 i think a lot of us would like to take another
5835818 brown cow depending on who you believe it was created by frank wisner in cripple creek
5835819 we lit up your world like the fourth of july
5835820 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
5835821 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5835822 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
5835823 the fight against abortion is a new frontier in the civil rights movement we are not following martins dream if we do not stand up for the voiceless
5835824 planned parenthood calls itself pro child pro woman and pro family yet it is an organization based on falsehoods about the human person the family and community life
5835825 the hotel congress dessert cookbook cake for your pie hole
5835826 just like god put so many wonderful people in my life you take the same thing take the people that he has put in your life and make sure that you are somebody that he put in their life
5835827 just like god put so many wonderful people in my life
5835828 you take the same thing take the people that he has put in your life and make sure that you are somebody that he put in their life
5835829 a hip urban makeover that reflects todays urban design trends
5835830 its sad because if you look at the list its heavily minority it looks bad
5835831 i think a lot of us would like to take another
5835832 brown cow depending on who you believe it was created by frank wisner in cripple creek
5835833 its sad because if you look at the list its heavily minority it looks bad
5835834 i think a lot of us would like to take another
5835835 brown cow depending on who you believe it was created by frank wisner in cripple creek
5835836 its sad because if you look at the list its heavily minority it looks bad
5835837 i think a lot of us would like to take another
5835838 brown cow depending on who you believe it was created by frank wisner in cripple creek
5835839 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
5835840 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
5835841 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
5835842 the mystics have not moved one ounce in their 11 year history and weve got to start making some changes it is the only way this team is going to survive
5835843 if i cant move the marker here im going to lose my fan base im going to lose my corporate support and i just might as well shut down and i dont want to do that i want to make a difference in this team i want a winning team
5835844 our issue has not been lack of effort it has been lack of talent
5835845 this is pro basketball and good coaching and gutty performances can only take a team so far the mystics need athletes and we need scorers and we need a roster of young ladies whose collective physical skills make other teams in the league dread the thought of playing us
5835846 the mystics have been operating for too long without a long term plan
5835847 in the three years that i have been an owner and a general partner our thinking has been far too shortsighted and our player personnel decisions are far too needs based that all ends today
5835848 shes done a wonderful job and she knows what our new mission is
5835849 and just like everybody else shes going to be held to a higher standard
5835850 theyll be a lot of evaluation in the next month to come
5835851 an important next step in the journey to ensuring the nations energy security
5835852 noyes has threatened to kill me and my family and will not rest until we are dead all the evidence you need is in his computer and that little girls mind please save her
5835853 extreme punishments such as locking her in a closet with no food for three days
5835854 evangelizing all people in our modern world remains an essential church mission today
5835855 i used to try to correct them but now it would be a full time job
5835856 balance and posture are critical to every activity from dancing to just walking
5835857 so often neglected mostly by guys who usually come to the gym to work their arms and legs
5835858 but just as important is a strong and flexible center especially for guys doing the variety of movements they do
5835859 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
5835860 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
5835861 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
5835862 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
5835863 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
5835864 i have a huge inventory of machines that i am not able to use
5835865 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit
5835866 there is no direct evidence that momin khawaja had any knowledge of the london fertilizer bomb plot
5835867 any time you are in the hospital its got to be pretty serious
5835868 i have seen a lot of people challenging others to races since michael has been doing so well
5835869 now theyre suddenly starting to think i can be like mike
5835870 it is possible to get to a level that up to this point people thought was impossible
5835871 im trying to get my work done today and the phones ringing off the hook
5835872 weve just experienced the greatest media attention that weve ever experienced as a sport
5835873 michael phelps has taken it to a whole new level
5835874 i learned that if you kick harder on your streamlines then you can go farther
5835875 if i was michael phelps right now i would probably be swimming
5835876 because swimming to me is really fun and also it would keep him in shape
5835877 we have no right to ask when a sorrow comes why did this happen to me unless we ask the same question for every joy that comes our way
5835878 the forecast calls for it fay to move very slowly possibly into the atlantic again it could strengthen again and come back at florida and maybe even make it into the gulf of mexico
5835879 there are some computer models that call for that so weve got many many many days to watch this
5835880 we do have some bands feeding into the storm from the south
5835881 it will be these bands rotating into the storm and breaking off that could impact the bay area
5835882 we could see some tropical storm conditions from these bands
5835883 the great experiment the story of ancient empires modern states and the quest for a global nation
5835884 failed crusade america and the tragedy of post communist russia
5835885 my determination is intact france is determined to continue the struggle against
5835886 helicopters arrived on station soon after and engaged these insurgents as they attempted to flee from the scene
5835887 three of the insurgents killed themselves by detonating their suicide vests isaf forces killed three other suicide bombers before they could detonate their vests there were no isaf casualties in the attack
5835888 sam put his life on the line with and for coalition forces on a daily basis
5835889 im currently ranked first in the world cup ive made the podium regularly
5835890 if they didnt expect that i would win a medal it would be a little funny
5835891 i know i can be on the podium but it does not take much to not be there either
5835892 everyone wants the olympic medal and there are only three medals some girls have just prepared for the games in my case i did not dominate the season finishing each time only minutes ahead it was close
5835893 sure ill be disappointed if i come back without a medal
5835894 after that ill move on to something else i wouldnt take months to recover from an olympic defeat life goes on
5835895 marie has always given everything and will give everything to win gold
5835896 its a course with many changes of pace steep climbs rocks and sharp descents
5835897 two thirds of the course has been modified since the pre olympic event
5835898 thats very particular but i dont think im going to be able to shoot
5835899 i had a little dry throat on the course despite the high humidity
5835900 i dont know if this is an effect of the pollution
5835901 otherwise i have not had difficulty breathing even in the heat it was super good
5835902 we have a little shade on the course but there is never any wind its so suffocating
5835903 she has a window of four or five days to acclimatize before an outdoor competition
5835904 before michael phelps team sports dominated everything 14 year old will meadows said at tuesdays workout
5835905 i have seen a lot of people challenging others to races since michael has been doing so well
5835906 now theyre suddenly starting to think i can be like mike
5835907 it is possible to get to a level that up to this point people thought was impossible
5835908 im trying to get my work done today and the phones ringing off the hook
5835909 weve just experienced the greatest media attention that weve ever experienced as a sport
5835910 i think thats going to help us in westport conn ellen johnston head coach of the water rat swim team at the westport weston family y estimated they have received 50 to 60 phone calls and emails from those interested in the team and swimming twice the normal number many of the inquiries are from young children under 12 she said while the olympics always raise the profile of the sport michael phelps has taken it to a whole new level
5835911 i learned that if you kick harder on your streamlines then you can go farther
5835912 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5835913 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5835914 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5835915 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5835916 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5835917 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5835918 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5835919 everybody in this room could be donating to some other cause or to their own well being but i want to thank you
5835920 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5835921 for laying each section of the reef we need it perfectly flat
5835922 if we get a break in the weather i dont see a problem at all
5835923 the reef doesnt make waves if there is no swell it isnt going to do anything it really breaks them where and how we want them
5835924 it will basically focus the waves energy amplify it and ensure no loss of power
5835925 you should get a more powerful consistent wave and it will definitely improve the surfing we have got
5835926 the real hard core surfers will always go where the best waves are
5835927 but they are not the main market it is the short mid week break where we will do well we will offer that as an alternative to cornwall
5835928 we still have a very strong traditional guest house market as well i think the surfing market does have a wide appeal and there is little conflict between the two
5835929 people are more interested in doing something good with their leisure time rather than lying around on the beach drinking beer
5835930 i think there has been a cultural shift in the past 10 years
5835931 how will the extra people be catered for in terms of transport and getting them to the seafront
5835932 there have been concerns about that and that remains the case
5835933 it is pretty well documented that groynes dont work as well as it is perceived
5835934 they have to replaced every so often and they are not that nice either
5835935 people are going to travel from across the country to come here
5835936 it was the first spring after the long hard winter that marked the second coming of the called dr sam the sun was april bright but the wind seemed stuck in march it roared down the mountainside with the ferocity of a lion blowing ripples on the surface of the rivers fast moving waters
5835937 lady elinor ashworth stared out the window of her bedchamber at acres of farmland sprouting new growth spring green brightened the vista taunting her with the promise of freedom
5835938 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5835939 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
5835940 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq
5835941 wenn man die natur einer sache durchschaut hat wird sie berechenbar
5835942 sure netflix offers a streaming service which is still up and running just fine
5835943 well we didn t lay the framework for the capacity like we should have blah blah blah
5835944 any time you are in the hospital its got to be pretty serious

5835949 cbs asked us whos at the top of your dream list
5835950 without hesitation we said laurence fishburne he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range mr fishburne is also a talented writer and director if you distill csi down to its essence its a collaboration and we are so looking forward to collaborating with mr fishburne for all of us at csi this is truly a dream
5835951 i am elated and delighted to be joining the cast of csi
5835952 i look forward to a wonderful collaboration with the creative and talented team of such a successful and distinguished show
5835953 has become overly politicized and important engineering details have been overlooked in washington debates
5835954 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5835955 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5835956 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5835957 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5835958 how awesome it is to be one of the five awesome gays
5835959 wenn man die natur einer sache durchschaut hat wird sie berechenbar
5835960 evo sempre nos defendeu em rela o quest o da terra as pessoas muito pobres ele defende a classe de baixo as pessoas sofridas
5835961 ele faz parte do grupo de pol ticos antigos que j governaram e por culpa deles que estamos assim n o mudaram a bol via
5835962 porque ele est fazendo as mudan as est melhorando os col gios construindo gin sios para as escolas depois do referendo ele ter mais for a vai ser melhor para governar
5835963 it means the world to me to retain the armband
5835964 it was a little bit of a surprise because of the form rio has shown for manchester united and what they have achieved over the last couple of seasons
5835965 i was standing next to rio when the coach announced it and he turned to me and shook my hand that shows the quality of the man
5835966 i think i showed to the manager what kind of captain i am at the end of last season he gave me a boost by giving me the armband against the united states when i scored and i am now delighted to have the chance of captaining a winning england team
5835967 johns big personality is why i chose him but rio is also important for the team which is why i made him vice captain
5835968 but the captain needs a big personality on and off the pitch and in the dressing room
5835969 i want to see england playing with spirit and without fear tomorrow and with a big personality as a team it is a very important match for us the last before the qualifiers start and i want us to take another step forward
5835970 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
5835971 studies show that without treatment 50 percent of children with hiv will die within the first two years of their lives
5835972 it is imperative that all children are diagnosed and started on treatment as early as possible after diagnosis or too many children will continue to die
5835973 selos grandes e pequenos me disseram que est o empolgados com o muxtape como um modelo de descobrir e vender m sica sele es em fitas casete era uma maneira t o boa de descobrir novas m sicas antes da internet e eu acho que as li es que aprendemos naquela era podem ser trazidas para esta
5835974 the politicization of energy is only beneficial to those running for office
5835975 spain has seen the future and it is slow dim and uncomfortable
5835976 to constitute a war injury case it is not that the person must suffer a bullet injury in view of the definition of a battle casualty
5835977 it has been decided to provide her a monthly dole of rs 15 000 by opening a fixed deposit account of rs 20 lakh which would earn a monthly interest of this amount whereas on august 28 our team will hand her rs 2 lakh again in the form of a bank acocunt which would cumulatively make for monthly aid for this year
5835978 nobody else has such big plots in the wadala area the mmrda plots would set a benchmark in real estate rates in this central area of mumbai
5835979 mmrda strongly favours offering the commercial plot to financial institutions such as banks insurance companies housing finance agencies merchant banks asset management companies or mutual fund groups we would prefer renowned fis to bid for the plot corporate developers catering to financial institutions or it telecom companies would also be a good option
5835980 the recently sanctioned monorail line between jacob circle and chembur would have a station at the wadala terminus moreover mmrda would soon invite bids from developers to construct the inter state bus terminus nearby
5835981 its just five minutes from the guru tegh bahadur gtb station on the harbour line there is a flyover connecting the plot to the eastern express highway also
5835982 people staying in sion koliwada everard nagar bhakti park are a stones throw from this plot anyway moviegoers all over mumbai know of this area because of their visit to imax adlabs
5835983 city youths like zahid shaikh shamsuddin shaikh arif kagzi and gyasuddin ansari took the bomb planters for recces five of the planters were from mp two from maharashtra and two were from karnataka in all fourteen to fifteen people were involved in placing the bombs
5835984 these were the best cadets from numerous terror camps organized in vagamon forest in kerala hubli in karnataka khandwa in mp and halol in gujarat
5835985 some revelations like zahid shaikh s involvement in the civil hospital blasts that killed 32 have already been made we expect some more all the bomb planters have been identified and some of them have been detained too
5835986 the id alarbi gujarat yahoo com was created in mumbai 12 minutes before the mail was sent at 6 40 pm on july 26 two other ids were created on july 27
5835987 we are in process of getting more information from service providers
5835988 one of the accused has told us that subhan was present in mumbai when the mail was sent he had created four different ids to send the e mails
5835989 so far its going good we have power and everything its just been windy and rainy
5835990 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day
5835991 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

5835997 i was happy with the way i punted on saturday night
5835998 i feel like i have been punting well all the way through training camp i felt like that first game against cincinnati i just got in a couple of bad situations and couldnt hit the ball the way i wanted it to
5835999 i have my routines with the days that i punt on and how many balls i hit i dont change it up i just stick to my game plan
5836000 you always want to play well after you have a bit of an off week but at the same time youve got to trust your skills and trust everything you have been doing and just go out and do what you have always done
5836001 in terms of workouts i kept that pretty much the same
5836002 i stuck with s plan and spent the offseason here
5836003 im just looking to continue to improve on everything because you can always get better i just want to improve my consistency and keep my technique sound
5836004 coach mike stock has been really good with letting me kind of decide how many balls i want to kick and making sure that my leg is fresh
5836005 im probably not kicking any more balls than i did last year or in 06
5836006 it took a little bit to get used to j j but all of the kinks got out in may and june during the otas
5836007 now it is completely normal and were comfortable the operation times are good and mason crosby is comfortable with him so were fine
5836008 were kind of getting a chemistry between the three of us and the more comfortable i get with him the more comfortable mason is as well so i think that is important
5836009 you have to put it out of your mind because after that youre not going to be able to focus if youre constantly focusing on the ones you did drop
5836010 when youre dealing with guys who like to run after the catch sometimes that run after the catch gets before the actual catch and you take your eyes off that ball for that split second right before it touches your hand and thats when the drops occur
5836011 it falls under the category we talked about yesterday about fundamentals
5836012 we didnt have a very good night in fundamentals whether it was our pad level footwork dropping the ball throwing the ball so those are all things we work on every day we need to do a better job of it
5836013 i think we have a perimeter group that catches the ball very well illustrated by what we have done in the past but that doesnt carry over obviously to the present we work on it every day im not concerned as we move forward but we need to catch the ball better
5836014 having never really been in a game with him for an extensive period of time especially this week its imperative i got out there and got some work done try to see how hes seeing the game how hes viewing the defense things like that
5836015 all thats vital to getting out there and playing games
5836016 im really a firm believer it doesnt take that long
5836017 if youre dealing with a group of guys that are competitive and want to win they kind of seem to gel together pretty quickly i think youll see that
5836018 if we get to the point where we feel like a player even though hes in the top 75 but wouldnt contribute in the final game then sometimes we go ahead and let him go
5836019 cut days are the toughest days for all of us in this business because you get attached to people and you have to tell them they cant make your team its a tough time
5836020 i think maybe i brought bad luck to us or something
5836021 it is the second biggest economy in the world and in 50 years it will be the biggest
5836022 starting with diefenbaker trudeau and all of us we established very good relations relatively speaking with china and suddenly you break the bridge it would have been easy just to be there
5836023 it the deal reflects well on the quality of our underlying mortgage assets
5836024 even if its absolutely good prime assets it seems tight it depends on what the details of the structure are
5836025 it is definitely a positive in the sense that its the second deal this year that was actually placed in the market but you cant really extend it to say the primary market is opening up
5836026 we see the shares falling back again possibly towards their recent low of 208 pence as the sector overall gives back some of its recent rally
5836027 there is confusion and an element of denial over direct property pricing due to a lack of transactions
5836028 you cant just expect someone to go out and run four miles if they havent run in a long time
5836029 youre a little ragged out and shes fresh so now your abilities are reasonably commensurate
5836030 between fitting in time and deciding what youre going to do there are a lot of details that have to be decided on
5836031 if its planned ahead and scheduled youre much more likely to do it
5836032 if you just wait for the willpower wait for the inspiration youll just be sitting there waiting
5836033 when someone makes an outlay for personal training theyre financially committing to improving their health to making some progress
5836034 it is definitely the best period for the indian film industry and personally for my films
5836035 this deal has really brought me immense joy i am told it is the highest ever in the history of bollywood which makes me even more proud
5836036 the more i get to play characters that are glamorous the less pressure i feel to do it in my own life
5836037 when you never get dressed up sometimes you think oh i really should pull it together when its your job to look like that you think ill just wear jeans and the most awesome rock star t shirt i can find if anything its liberated my inner couch potato
5836038 there are lots of form fitting dresses with truly beautiful lines theres more of a focus on ankles calves and collarbones as opposed to cleavage butts and things like that
5836039 i had really nice clothes oscar de la renta chanel

5836046 can run in any number of physical and virtual oses operating system environments within a server farm as long as the number of physical processors being used by running instances of the software at any one time does not exceed the number of licenses assigned to servers in the server farm
5836047 in a time zone that is within four hours of the local time zone of the other
5836048 count the greatest number of physical processors at any time supporting running instances across your server farm and assign that number of licenses
5836049 these instances run on a server farm made up of 20 servers each with four physical processors if just three unique physical processors support the three running instances then based on the licensing changes you need only three sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses so you can run those three instances anywhere in your server farm if however two physical processors support each of the running instances for a total of six unique physical processors in this scenario you would need six sql server 2008 enterprise processor licenses without the licensing changes you would need 80 processor licenses to support moving the instances freely in the server farm

5836052 i think mustard has an automatic warmth to it a lot of the trick of modern fashion is seasonless clothes no one wants to wear heavy clothes even in the fall

5836057 several factors combined to increase housing affordability nationwide there was a marginal rise in mortgage rates which still remain near the historically low levels of a few years ago family income nationwide held steady and lower house prices

5836071 martin had gone to the taxi rank and was asked for a cigarette
5836072 he said no and they just launched into him it was three on one he had no chance
5836073 we have just bought a house and we are doing it up we were going to do the wallpapering on saturday so martin had stopped drinking early because he wanted to be ready to get started the next morning
5836074 he came home in a taxi and came straight to the bedroom he was unsteady on his feet and the right side of his face was covered in blood he was crying and not making any sense
5836075 i called his friend who is a nurse who tended his wounds but he just deteriorated i thought he had fallen asleep and tried to wake him but he got agitated and shouted please get off me and leave me alone
5836076 he is very very poorly and fighting for his life he is in a drug induced coma and has swelling in his brain
5836077 i am devastated martin is really popular very loyal and outgoing we have a big group of friends and we had been looking forward to getting the house ready together
5836078 as soon as i wake up i go to see him
5836079 i am there from nine in the morning until nine at night just to be with him he is my main priority nothing else is as important as him until he gets better and also afterwards when i will look after him
5836080 whoever did it has to hand themselves in they cant get away with it and think nothing serious has happened his family is distraught he is the best person i know
5836081 many witnesses have been coming forward but i dont think the offenders realise the seriousness of their actions
5836082 at the moment martins family is distraught by what has happened but luckily martin is fighting hard
5836083 i am appealing to the consciences of those responsible and those that know them come forward and explain yourselves before we track you down
5836084 we are going back to try to have a more technically sound midfield we need to have a group that can hold the ball and then attack with or without the ball the the other area that can help improve our scoring immediately is set pieces it is the once chance you get in soccer to draw up plays and execute something that you specifically worked on in practice
5836085 there has been good competition amongst the goaltenders though camp but we havent made a decision yet on who will get the starts
5836086 we need to become more active more mobile and just a better attacking group in the midfield
5836087 that midfield needs to be used to get more people involved on the attack and into the box it is probably where we lost the most depth at but is where we focused most on in recruiting and i think we got a good amount of players to cover that up
5836088 i like what we have with thalia coming off the bench
5836089 we can use her up top or bring her back as the attacking center mid
5836090 it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
5836091 im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years
5836092 everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
5836093 i think it will be ok were both grown women both professionals once we were working it felt like a good fit
5836094 everybody was on pins and needles and sort of waiting to see how theyd react
5836095 they started off kind of tentative but by the time we were five takes in they were giggling and seemed to be reconnecting
5836096 i know shannen probably doesnt share the feelings that i have for tori but i love tori like my sister
5836097 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5836098 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5836099 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5836100 sometimes i cry sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of healing
5836101 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5836102 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5836103 oh my god i was so pissed off so mad i was just shaking
5836104 immediately i had to go into take care of business mode
5836105 i watched her have a mastectomy and then i watched her go through two years of chemotherapy and eight surgeries and a hysterectomy
5836106 ive watched this woman survive both of those things so for me there was always that sense that i was going to be okay no matter what
5836107 besides me being really vigilant about it mammograms and self examinations it is the no 1 reason i am going to live

5836122 helen is a wonderful person shes done an awful lot for me
5836123 i dont know what i would have done without her on several occasions shes been there whenever i called her or when i told her that something wasnt just right she was there
5836124 sometimes when im not feeling as good as i should we just sit around and laugh we always have a marvelous time
5836125 oh lord you get so close to your clients you can see what youre doing you can tell by their expressions how grateful they are
5836126 theyll come down here for hours and just sit and talk now
5836127 thats what its all about just getting them down here talking
5836128 we cant get out of our apartment now without someone calling us over to ask about tickets for the next show or an upcoming event

5836133 this marriage is already over and its because the guy found someone else another woman and we thought he was gay
5836134 if i had to bet my life on it id bet it is joe
5836135 barack is moving toward a seasoned beltway type and that probably means biden
5836136 joe wont be afraid to get in mccains face which is what obama needs
5836137 barring a big surprise or last minute change of heart the choice is likely to be sen joe biden of delaware chairman of the foreign relations committee
5836138 the white house isnt the place to learn how to deal with international crisis the balance of power war and peace and the economic future of the next generation a president has got to know the territory but thats not enough
5836139 it strikes me that any pick designed to cover up a flaw in obama i e lack of foreign policy credentials only accentuates those flaws
5836140 id love to see him pick a fresh face in politics who reinforces obamas message of change
5836141 this is just one of a number of possible reactions to the situation
5836142 we are voicing the opinion of several members and if the resolution passes the entire congress
5836143 there is still sufficient time to designate a new host city and to allow a new host city adequate time to prepare to host a successful olympics
5836144 im not the first one to draw the iocs attention to the conflict it is a difficult and threatening situation we do this with the greatest respect to the olympic games and the international olympic committee
5836145 it depends what happens with russias compliance to the ceasefire it could change over the next couple of weeks but this is a very serious conflict that has recently escalated
5836146 this has nothing to do with the preparations for the games
5836147 there is nothing funny in whats happening it is very sad whats going on in the world
5836148 we are totally confident they are going to make magnificent games

5836155 a long time ago someone told me that there is a big difference between playing hurt and playing injured

5836157 mike goff is what i refer to as a warrior in this league
5836158 hes a very unselfish player who has played at a high level for an extended period of time hes a hard worker and he has a great character hes not afraid to go out on the field and practice hurt or to play hurt in a game i have great respect and admiration for him
5836159 youve got to play through some pain and thats what develops your character
5836160 you just learn to play through it which enables you to build up a tolerance i would say a majority of it is not wanting to let down my teammates or coaches you just always want to go out there and perform at your best
5836161 mikes a veteran player who gives us consistency and a very physical presence on the field
5836162 goff is a great example for a young offensive lineman to look up to coming into the league
5836163 he shows you how to work how to keep your head down and how to accomplish what youre asked to do

5836172 she feels horrible about giving them false hopes that their daughter was still alive
5836173 it was more of a way of life for her it was surviving her life it was trying to move past esther reed and who she was in reality
5836174 she has a lot of things in her background and a lot of bad family relationships that she was trying to get away from
5836175 were glad to see this case to this resolution i hope this gives the family some sort of resolution

5836216 however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the oort cloud
5836217 the existence of an inner oort cloud has been theoretically predicted for many years but sq372 and perhaps sedna are the first objects we have found that seem to originate there its exciting that we are beginning to verify these predictions
5836218 there are bound to be many more objects like this waiting to be discovered by the next generation of surveys which will search to fainter levels and cover more area

5836232 wimax has gained such momentum across so many regions that it is no longer sensible to suggest that wimax growth will be flattened by the emergence of lte in the next few years in populous countries with poor national telecom infrastructure such as india brazil and africa there is a lack of broadband services and even of basic voice services which is a significant driver for wimax adoption in many developing countries with india being the prime example wimax is showing promising signs of becoming the primary broadband infrastructure and a prominent 3g mobile technology india is absolutely critical to the fortunes of wimax and the level of uptake there will help decide how prominent a position 802 16e takes in the overall wireless landscape in the next decade
5836233 despite use by some isps and the general industry blacklists are a 1980s approach to a modern day problem
5836234 the online advertising industry has already witnessed firsthand the deficiency of ip blacklisting as it is highly ineffective for catching other types of malicious activity on the internet including payment fraud and spam its time to evolve our approach to click fraud if we really want to solve the problem
5836235 in the case with email ip blacklists have been used to block unwanted emails from being sent to users and have provided some level of protection in the short term
5836236 however blacklisting ips is not a singular solution isps need to take a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to fighting junk mail while ensuring that legitimate email gets delivered to the inbox
5836237 between ip blacklisting and doing nothing to combat click fraud blacklisting will provide some value
5836238 however a solution that leverages behavioral and reputational characteristics of traffic in a timely manner will do a much better job in identifying non billable clicks reducing the number of clicks that are incorrectly classified as non billable and in turn bringing a higher level of accountability to search engine marketing

5836240 they werent inside or in auditoriums they were on muscle beach in california dan said lets try that tradition here in new york on jones beach and i was all for it
5836241 well also invite the audience to tell us by applause who they like best
5836242 they have been playing an attacking expansive type of game and i think theyll keep going with that mitchell said
5836243 it is up to us to make sure we are on our game with our defensive policies and that sort of thing
5836244 if there is any opportunity for turnovers or things like that we can hopefully sting them back
5836245 with these new elvs it certainly creates a lot more opportunity at full back in terms of counter attack and turn over ball and getting your hands on the ball as much as you can
5836246 certainly late in the halves when the bigger guys are getting fatigued there is some scope there to try and get involved and get a few mismatches
5836247 jimmy horwill and rocky both trained fully so the key now will be how they respond to that deans said
5836248 they had a scrummaging session which is the first one theyve had as well so the fact that theyre out here and doing it is good it means theres a chance but the key will be how they report after that
5836249 we dont want to set it back so that they then need an operation weve got to be sensible about it because theres still footy to come
5836250 it grumbles a little bit but thats pretty much as expected so at the moment its feeling nothing new and it feels pretty good so i cant see a reason why it will keep me out he said
5836251 im pretty unorthodox i can find the leg from anywhere thats just what happened i didnt even see the leg but i ended up grabbing it and i just popped my hips took him to his back and kept driving i knew if i kept driving he would end up on his back which he did

5836265 the tourists appear to have little regard for the neighborhood and its residents and view the stop as akin to visiting a zoo or other attraction where they are entertained by exhibits or animals
5836266 they come down from twin peaks on the way to civic center
5836267 the tour guide told me to stop there for about 20 minutes so they can get out

5836270 they come in here 15 or 20 at a time
5836271 they look around take a picture and then they walk out in the last three months ive sold one bottle of water it is not worth having so much traffic were not a photo album
5836272 the guy from muni says it is already illegal to park there
5836273 but now he says we have to make it officially illegal its absurd
5836274 they were unhappy with the situation and they wanted it stopped
5836275 well just get the sisters of perpetual indulgence on this
5836276 a few blessings from them and those tour buses would disappear
5836277 many of them seem uncomfortable or shocked by their surroundings
5836278 youve got these throngs of people walking up and down market and 18th holding hands to make it clear that they are heterosexual
5836279 you came to my door eight years ago and told me you were going to get lights on lumbert mill road i personally think you have taken too long to follow through on your promise and too many people have been injured or killed at that intersection in the past eight years i called you with a problem i had with the dpw and you never returned my call you sent me a letter because i signed the petition for your recall my neighbor did not sign and she did not get the letter i felt intimidated by that letter my neighbor and i are both signing the latest petition because we are tired of your lies thanks for informing me about that cog site in your letter i did not know about them and i am glad someone is paying attention to what is going on downtown i will post my comment there as well as i doubt you will post this on your personal propaganda page

5836390 to come down fifty cents so quickly came as a big surprise crude oil was going down three four five dollars a day so it was surprising the pace that led us to where we are
5836391 downward price pressures would increase if the economic slowdown proves deeper or longer than expected and if higher prices lead to lower consumption and lower demand for opec crude than currently anticipated
5836392 there is also a risk that any weakness in oil prices could be minimal or short lived especially if consumption growth exceeds current expectations or if oil production capacity expansion plans in either opec or non opec nations turn out to be lower than expected
5836393 if conditions stay the way they are and demand stays the same we could see further decreases

5836453 if i get extradited the justice and peace process ends there because the foot soldiers do not know anything
5836454 if i go then the story of the self defense forces is incomplete
5836455 i see this with huge and profound concern because it could leave many cases in impunity
5836456 by the hastiness to resolve one problem and that problem is drug trafficking
5836457 but it wasnt because justice and peace was not providing results
5836458 thats the rules and you have to play by them
5836459 es war mit dem ganzen geld im r cken kein problem zu sagen wir brauchen noch ein halbes jahr f r bugfixing und endschliff

5836464 cant she just speak chinese she thinks shes so westernized just because she plays a bourgeois sport
5836465 you cant expect everyone to understand the rules of watching a tennis game
5836466 what we can do as chinese is to cheer as much as we can whenever we see our players competing whats wrong with that
5836467 buy it use it break it fix it trash it change it mail upgrade it
5836468 its a good chance that the 2010 challenger convertibles will be marked up as well
5836469 would you have any difficulty finding an 84 year old guilty of a crime if you know that a conviction might result in a prison term
5836470 all the negative attacks from the mccain campaign seem to have been paying off
5836471 the idea of promoting the neighborhood formerly known as south central with a gun hmmm

5836477 extreme punishments such as locking her in a closet with no food for three days

5836487 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since
5836488 i do not mean to personally impugn them as they might be good people in the flesh but the medias images of them are smelly and vile and i must always attack the medias representation of what is good or cool
5836489 those who inhabit the media world of glamour and entertainment and fashion and gossip are horrid people who have no talent of any kind and yet think of themselves as tastemakers

5836505 many young and recently diagnosed hiv positive men have therapeutic optimism thinking that with the availability of certain treatments in the past nine years or so the disease is curable and they are not infectious
5836506 because the hepatitis c virus attacks the liver and hiv aids patients receive highly toxic antiretroviral drugs that take a toll on the liver it makes treatment much more complicated
5836507 were making a proposal to the government to prescribe men with viagra in order to increase their chance of using condoms
5836508 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
5836509 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
5836510 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
5836511 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines

5836518 looking forward to utilizing fresh local ingredients to create regionally inspired recipes with bold flavors that are artistically presented in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere
5836519 our chef driven restaurants will set new standards in puerto penasco
5836520 chef martinez imaginative dishes are truly tempting to the palate
5836521 because they both spent so many years on the outskirts of fame
5836522 i really felt for this guy who gets a chance to grow up gets a second chance at fame and gets to finally live his dream
5836523 i was an actor for a long long time before i had any real success but i was always working so i can really relate to someone late in life getting a shot at celebrity
5836524 there kind of has to be youre just like a big baboon off in the corner pounding on things
5836525 before landing a key role as a funeral home intern on hbos hit drama
5836526 my whole thing is i just wanted to be a working actor and i just wanted to stop waiting tables
5836527 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5836528 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5836529 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5836530 archaelogists in berlin have uncovered 2 000 skeletons in a huge medieval cemetery near the city center since they started examining the site in march 2007

5836546 ive always hated the danger part of climbing and its great to come down again because its safe

5836548 oh honey i dont have a drill that will go through that and well cut ourselves to pieces on those sharp edges besides do you really want to look at a 3 by 4 sheet metal box in the backyard especially once it rusts
5836549 i said once her husband sees that hes gonna hit the roof

5836559 most of my residents dont want drug users for neighbors
5836560 hanno dei fucili e cacciano e molto noioso allevano anche delle galline e il loro solo interesse tu cerchi delle galline
5836561 tu fino ad ora per me non sei che un ragazzino uguale a centomila ragazzini e non ho bisogno di te e neppure tu hai bisogno di me io non sono per te che una volpe uguale a centomila volpi ma se tu mi addomestichi noi avremo bisogno luno dellaltro tu sarai per me unico al mondo e io saro per te unica al mondo
5836562 la mia vita e monotona io do la caccia alle galline e gli uomini danno la caccia a me tutte le galline si assomigliano e tutti gli uomini si assomigliano e io mi annoio percio ma se tu mi addomestichi la mia vita sara illuminata conoscero un rumore di passi che sara diverso da tutti gli altri gli altri passi mi fanno nascondere sotto terra il tuo mi fara uscire dalla tana come una musica e poi guarda vedi laggiu in fondo dei campi di grano io non mangio il pane e il grano per me e inutile i campi di grano non mi ricordano nulla e questo e triste ma tu hai dei capelli color delloro allora sara meraviglioso quando mi avrai addomesticato il grano che e dorato mi fara pensare a te e amero il rumore del vento nel grano
5836563 ma non ho molto tempo pero ho da scoprire degli amici e da conoscere molte cose
5836564 gli uomini non hanno piu tempo per conoscere nulla comprano dai mercanti le cose gia fatte ma siccome non esistono mercanti di amici gli uomini non hanno piu amici se tu vuoi un amico addomesticami
5836565 in principio tu ti sederai un po lontano da me cosi nellerba io ti guardero con la coda dellocchio e tu non dirai nulla le parole sono una fonte di malintesi ma ogni giorno tu potrai sederti un po piu vicino
5836566 se tu vieni per esempio tutti i pomeriggi alle quattro dalle tre io comincero ad essere felice col passare dellora aumentera la mia felicita quando saranno le quattro incomincero ad agitarmi e ad inquietarmi scopriro il prezzo della felicita ma se tu vieni non si sa quando io non sapro mai a che ora prepararmi il cuore ci vogliono i riti
5836567 e quello che fa un giorno diverso dagli altri giorni unora dalle altre ore ce un rito per esempio presso i miei cacciatori il giovedi ballano con le ragazze del villaggio allora il giovedi e un giorno meraviglioso io mi spingo sino alla vigna se i cacciatori ballassero in un giorno qualsiasi i giorni si assomiglierebbero tutti e non avrei mai vacanza
5836568 io non ti volevo far del male ma tu hai voluto che ti addomesticassi
5836569 va a rivedere le rose capirai che la tua e unica al mondo quando ritornerai a dirmi addio ti regalero un segreto
5836570 voi non siete per niente simili alla mia rosa voi non siete ancora niente
5836571 nessuno vi ha addomesticato e voi non avete addomesticato nessuno voi siete come era la mia volpe non era che una volpe uguale a centomila altre ma ne ho fatto il mio amico ed ora e per me unica al mondo
5836572 non si puo morire per voi certamente un qualsiasi passante crederebbe che la mia rosa vi rassomigli ma lei lei sola e piu importante di tutte voi perche e lei che ho innaffiata perche e lei che ho messa sotto la campana di vetro perche e lei che ho riparata col paravento perche su di lei ho uccisi i bruchi salvo i due o tre per le farfalle perche e lei che ho ascoltato lamentarsi o vantarsi o anche qualche volta tacere perche e la mia rosa
5836573 ecco il mio segreto e molto semplice non si vede bene che col cuore lessenziale e invisibile agli occhi
5836574 e il tempo che tu hai perduto per la tua rosa che ha fatto la tua rosa cosi importante
5836575 e il tempo che ho perduto per la mia rosa
5836576 gli uomini hanno dimenticato questa verita ma tu non la devi dimenticare tu diventi responsabile per sempre di quello che hai addomesticato tu sei responsabile della tua rosa
5836577 quel cielo di lombardia cos bello quando bello cos splendido cos in pace

5836586 i think a lot of us would like to take another
5836587 brown cow depending on who you believe it was created by frank wisner in cripple creek
5836588 hot in hollywood gala this past weekend she was casually beautiful
5836589 were the only industry of this size and scope that doesnt have a real voice in this process at best were humored at worst were ignored
5836590 is it making our community stronger or are we trapped in that model
5836591 the philanthropic dollars provide us the money to experiment and try new things
5836592 philanthropy can fail in a way that government cant but we can catalyze government investment in growing what works
5836593 there are a lot of people in this sector who will get nervous about the federal government becoming too engaged in philanthropy
5836594 but theres also this other argument that we dont want an agency that is going to over regulate us
5836595 the growing market share of classified ads using the free internet model coupled with the fact that classified ads are not one of our companys core businesses forced us to close the division
5836596 more than 20 dollars clearly shows that there has been speculation in the market
5836597 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5836598 the price must be maintained at a level close to 100 dollars because the costs have increased
5836599 the market is reacting to reports that opec may cut production
5836600 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5836601 oil has lost its bullish mojo and it may take a major event or a great technical stand to go get its groove back
5836602 the same way this market seemingly overreacted to every bullish nugget of information on the way up it is now ignoring those same nuggets on the way down
5836603 la retirada de las fuerzas rusas ha comenzado aunque hay que esperar varios d as para realizar el plan de paz de seis puntos

5836612 o maryam in verit chi ti ha dato queste leccornie
5836613 vengono dal dio il dio nutre chi vuole senza misura
5836614 rabbi rabbi concedimi da parte tua discendenza scelta tu in verit sei colui che ascolta la preghiera personale
5836615 ecco il dio ti annuncia il lietissimo verbo circa yahya egli verr per riconfermare la parola del dio e sar capo casto nabi apparterr alla schiera dei pi
5836616 rabbi rabbi avr dunque prole il mio capo bianco di canizie e mia moglie oramai sterile
5836617 tu chiedi come questo sia possibile ma il dio fa esattamente ci che vuole
5836618 il segno fu risposto sar questo non parlerai alla gente per tre giorni di fila ti esprimerai a gesti tuttavia non dimenticare il signore e canta a lui osanna al levar dellaurora e al tramonto del giorno
5836619 o maryam il dio ti ha prescelta ti ha resa immacolata ti ha posto sopra tutte le donne di questo mondo 43 o maryam vedi dessere devota al tuo signore prosternati davanti a lui nel sugud e chinati con quelli che si inchinano
5836620 o maryam il dio ti comunca lieta novella di un verbo da parte sua si chiamer al masih isa ibn maryam famoso sar sia in questo mondo che nellaltro sar uno degli intimi 46 alle genti parler sin dalla culla e continuer a parlare quando sar cresciuto e apparterr alla schiera delle genti di bene
5836621 rabbi rabbi proprio io avr un figlio io che non conosco uomo che non ho mai conosciuto un uomo
5836622 il dio crea ci che vuole e quando ha ben deciso di creare una cosa egli comanda
5836623 ma forse che la terra del dio non cos vasta da permettervi demigrare
5836624 perch non venuto un angelo dallalto se avessimo mandato un angelo il loro destino sarebbe cambiato di colpo senza pi indugio alcuno
5836625 ibrahim era paziente pieno di umilt e ben disposto verso il dio
5836626 ibrahim ibrahim non ti inquietare al riguardo lordine del signore venuto a tempo debito e un castigo tremendo improrogabile sta per giungere su loro
5836627 o popolo mio ecco le mie figliole sono pi pure per voi temete il dio e non coprite di vergogna i miei ospiti ma possibile che tra voi non ci sia un solo uomo capace di bene
5836628 lo sai benissimo nessun diritto abbiamo sul corpo delle tue figliole mentre concupiamo ardentemente gli altri
5836629 vorrei avere un po di forza contro di voi se almeno trovassi un soccorso presso qualche potente appoggio
5836630 o lut siamo veramente i rusul del signore e quei bestioni non ti faranno del male parti con la famiglia verso lalbeggiare nessuno si volti tua moglie purtroppo si volger indietro e ad essa capiter ci che capiter agli altri allora siamo intesi e arrivederci allalba che non deve tardare
5836631 o tu uomo su cui venne fatto discendere il richiamo tu sei certamente magnum 7 perch non sei giunto da noi accompagnato dagli angeli avremmo cos saputo che non menti davvero
5836632 avvertite non stancatevi di ripetere non c altro dio allinfuori di me temetemi dunque

5836684 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5836685 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5836686 canadian financials have to be treated quite differently were nowhere near the pain of writeoffs that have been endured by u s and european financials
5836687 the real story of this summer is the u s dollar rally and commodity prices going down which has triggered some rotation out of resource stocks and into financials so weve gone from a very dramatic oversold condition for banks to pretty much overbought conditions a few days ago
5836688 the bonds in which we have invested have not incurred losses but instead have made us more than a billion dollars in the last six months
5836689 this concludes a successful effort by our division of enforcement to stop fraud in its tracks return as much money as possible to defrauded investors and to bring wrongdoers to justice
5836690 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5836691 more than 20 dollars clearly shows that there has been speculation in the market

5836695 we have been evaluating growth opportunities in nevada for some time and this is the transaction that makes the most sense for our shareholders
5836696 we are very impressed with the victoria team and their property portfolio in the shorter term our shareholders receive an attractive premium and financial support to advance our projects in the longer term we will benefit from victorias aggressive growth plans and from the combined companys ability to attract financing from its many supporters

5836700 todos tenemos la misma sangre egipcia y si el motivo de la medida es prohibir el tr fico de rganos lo rechazamos porque puede ocurrir tambi n entre fieles de la misma religi n

5836734 given the movement of the dollar the renminbi hasnt appreciated as dramatically as significantly as against some other currencies like the euro and the yen
5836735 and so i think one of the things weve tried to do and weve done with some success is encourage other countries to speak about this topic and to engage with the chinese very directly on it
5836736 theres a lot of us investment in china and to get the protections that our investors need is something thats important and difficult to do on the other hand theres very little investment that the chinese have in the us and we think it would be a positive for both of our countries to have them have more investment in the us
5836737 the chinese sometimes question whether their investment is welcome here
5836738 the highest vote of confidence anyone can give our economy is to make a long term investment

5836808 so i have a job to do a job to complete in that sense yes i would like to run
5836809 i have begun a task to rebuild afghanistan into a peaceful prosperous country into a democratic country a country where the afghan people will have a voice and their rights respected a country that will be producing on its own and living off its own means
5836810 i have achieved some of those objectives i have not achieved some of the other objectives
5836811 afghanistan is not at peace the afghan people still suffer massively in the war against terrorism and in the war for stability in afghanistan afghanistan is not yet a well off country still a very poor country
5836812 does not have a properly functional government yet it must get that
5836813 the reason we are still around is because of the immense resilience of the afghan people and their goodheartedness toward the presence of the international community
5836814 other than that activities like breaking into homes would have gotten us into serious trouble a long time back
5836815 we also want the weaponry in this war to be targeted at the terrorists properly to be aimed at the right place
5836816 i dont want afghan casualties the war on terrorism is not in afghan villages period it is in the sanctuaries of terrorists at the training ground of terrorists at the financial resources of terrorists
5836817 it is virtually impossible to mitigate against loss of civilian lives when insurgents mix in with the local population
5836818 i dont for a second believe that afghanistan has a problem of terrorism
5836819 afghanistan has only suffered at the hands of terrorism or the consequences of it
5836820 what is troubling is the deteriorating set of conditions across the border in pakistan military sanctuaries expanding in areas in the tribal area and the freedom of movement across the border to afghanistan
5836821 with regard to corruption its a deeper problem its an afghan problem
5836822 its the problem of an inefficient government machinery its a problem of economy procedures its a problem of so much money coming into afghanistan its a problem of the international presence
5836823 we are going to sue them back unless this is resolved somehow
5836824 there was discussion such as what would happen if i am laid off from belron what will i do
5836825 there were two women that did have discussions with levesque about what they might do if they left they talked with her about whether they might have non compete restrictions or not and they talked about whether they might have options if they were laid off
5836826 she had many many conversations in which she was encouraging people to wait and see how things played out with belron
5836827 they told her shed been soliciting and she told them she ha d no idea what they were talking about
5836828 the next day they wrote a cease and desist letter saying she was violating a non compete agreement
5836829 this is false she has no non compete agreement anyone could look in her personnel file and find that it had been superseded and they told her they were going to sue her
5836830 they have no joint venture and they have never had a venture together
5836831 even if she had solicited which she has not none of them have left
5836832 shes gone now and they have no contract with her shes free to call up and solicit whomever she wants
5836833 they issued a company wide memo saying she solicited and violated the companys trust
5836834 she has gotten phone calls about that communication about the news coverage and shes gotten calls from people in the glass industry but not at belron or diamond about this and she feels that belron is basically making her unhirable and ruining her career
5836835 were going to file a counterclaim for violation of the family medical leave act for the violation of the massachusetts wages statute
5836836 were going to counterclaim for reckless pursuit of false claims against her in massachusetts thats considered an unfair business practice we fully intend to bring claims back against belron if this is not resolved
5836837 the whole idea is that it creates a white noise atmosphere
5836838 i wont say it drowns the noise out but it kind of pushes it further into the background so you can listen to something that is pleasing rather than listening to the conversation through the wall
5836839 this will be redeemable through rewards of accommodation transportation and entry to various attractions

5836845 it was important that we did play the game no matter where it was we have everything set out and the players were looking forward to the two games
5836846 they have made a decision on that now and i think its important they have made that decision
5836847 at least we know we are playing that game and people are looking forward to that now
5836848 but no matter where the game was we would have gone and played it anywhere because it is important for the group and it is important to get the three points

5836851 the primary reason outsiders feel hostile toward christians and especially conservative christians is not because of any specific theological perspective what they react negatively to is our swagger how we go about things and the sense of self importance we project

5836914 for the sort of work that mi5 is doing not just in operations but in terms of technical support and linguistics the caliber of people is terribly important to its effectiveness

5836916 if you have grown up as part of a minority community youre probably more used to fitting in and being inconspicuous

5836918 this wouldnt be happening if we didnt think they were taking some strenuous steps to move forward

5836921 once i injured the ankle in trials i knew what lay in store still instead of backtracking i decided to give it a go after all this is olympics and i have put in a lot of efforts just for this occasion
5836922 but i guess once you injure your take off ankle you really dont have anything to do
5836923 no this is the first time that i hurt it its not a strain or twist but i hurt the joint and just could not take off and it only aggravated when the qualifying round started i could neither run nor take off gt
5836924 probably it was not great but then i did not go full throttle all i wanted to do was to peak at the right time and give my best where it matters most unfortunately my ankle held me back
5836925 this is such a huge disappointment for me i came here in great shape and the cut mark 6 75 for the final looked well within reach but somehow it was not to be today

5836927 since the 1930s there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people whether it was hari singh or sheikh abdullah or someone else and the debate continues till today whether it is the hurriyat or some other party

5836942 i think its great for the city and the diners of our city to experience more traditional although not handcuffed to all old world traditions italian cuisine and culture

5836976 i like both dogs and cats but from a landlord perspective pet units are really more trouble than pet free units
5836977 when i rented to tenants with dogs i had dogs chew up the baseboards windowsills and tv cables dogs scratched the storm doors which had to be replaced dog urine ruined the hardwood floors even after sanding and refinishing you can still see the permanent stains
5836978 i was afraid to enter to let repairmen in or had repairmen refuse to enter because of a snarling dog i had other residents complain about barking and about owners who failed to pick up after their dogs ive had potential renters turn on their heels upon entering when they smelled the dog
5836979 although we can usually just patch and touch up wall paint between tenants we had to totally repaint after every dog left
5836980 when fleas get into the spaces between parquet floor tiles it takes about a year to exterminate all the generations that follow i paid 1 200 for this because the fleas werent discovered until i had given the old tenant his deposit back in full i almost lost the new tenant who first discovered fleas all over her socks and then had to have the exterminator come in each month
5836981 no dogs only indoor cats that have been spayed neutered and are declawed or have their nails trimmed regularly 250 refundable pet deposit and 25 per month pet rent should we still have problems at least the accrued pet rent helps take some of the sting out

5836988 a lot of companies big and small across the country are converting apartment buildings into condominiums because they are making so much money and people can buy them because interest rates are so low
5836989 all jurisdictions have some sort of notice provision that says you need to inform your existing apartment residents that youre intending to convert the units into condominiums
5836990 roommates may not be covered under the substantive provisions of the fair housing act but anything that excludes a protected class is illegal
5836991 this falls into a small zone of discussion where congress said if youre going to discriminate youre not going to be able to pollute public means of communication to do so but theres been such little enforcement in it that many people probably do not realize this conduct is illegal

5837006 i believe that a landlord can charge a set cleaning fee or redecorating fee provided that the terms of the written lease mention the fee
5837007 the virginia residential landlord and tenant act limits the amount of non refundable application fees and security deposits however a fixed sum cleaning fee would not be considered a deposit or application fee and is not prohibited

5837014 nobody should have to live like that being woken up in the middle of the night is not pleasant
5837015 if landlords really cared about lessening maintenance and damage they would seek to better the lives of pets and owners who seek to rent their properties rather than allowing disreputable pets and or people to rent from them and charging them a fee
5837016 pet rent is a scam at best it should be outlawed
5837017 each year we give out the number and we tell landlords please try to keep rent increases at or below this amount
5837018 they can ignore it because its voluntary believe it or not most people do it

5837022 en esta zona puede llegar a constituirse en una actividad muy importante que bien encarada y con criterios t cnicos y modernos de comercializaci n se puede ser muy competitivo
5837023 queremos lograr un abastecimiento de alguna importancia en cuanto a volumen y de gran calidad y competir pues no hay que olvidarse que se trata de un producto que se importa casi el 98 por ciento
5837024 se vaya organizando muy seriamente esta etapa y ganando espacio en la cadena porque ah realmente va a estar la rentabilidad y la seguridad de participar en un mercado con ventajas para el productor
5837025 porque el gobierno provincial a trav s del plan pro alimentos brinda un fuerte apoyo a esta producci n por medio de las asociaciones y cooperativas que nuclean a estos productores

5837037 conservation is no longer just a civic virtue it is fast emerging as a statewide necessity
5837038 however if the person he cosigned with stops paying rent gets evicted or the apartment or property manger sends unpaid lease payments to a collection agency then it could affect his credit history
5837039 lenders will blink pretty seriously when they see a collection account
5837040 additional maintenance it takes for the property it takes far more management from our perspective to actually allow pets
5837041 you can imagine the wear and tear pets cause the hallways pet owners arent always the most responsible because of pets our maintenance people are going out and fixing landscaping and cleaning up after pets and things like that
5837042 it truly is for the extra maintenance it takes to allow pets in the building and so people pay for the privilege of having their pets live with them

5837052 generally speaking an occasional inquiry of this type will not have a noticeable impact on your credit
5837053 generally speaking at transunion separate inquiries into an individuals credit that are generated when shopping around for either a home loan or an apartment to rent will be clustered into a single hard inquiry if they occur over the span of approximately one months time
5837054 when you check your own credit reports and scores thats known as a soft inquiry and has absolutely no impact on your credit

5837059 i want to note that for maybe the first time in history biden is 40 seconds under his time
5837060 spoke about his own irish american roots his grandfather finnegan his sons application to princeton he attended the university of pennsylvania instead biden said a speech the senator gave on the princeton campus the fact that biden is not a princeton fan and his views on the eyeglasses of sen dianne feinstein d calif
5837061 much like gary hart hes identified more with the partys presidential past than its present or future
5837062 he was after all forced out by a mini scandal which would come up again
5837063 the reason it became such an issue was that it reinforced the biden image that already existed among the press that hes a blowhard a guy who talked before he thought
5837064 now hes a little older and more experienced but do people really change that all much after they reach adulthood ive rarely seen anybody change that much and ive taught thousands of college students over the years
5837065 public discussion of global warming is befogged by contrarians whose opinions are given a megaphone by special interests that benefit by keeping the public confused
5837066 we detected a missile launch from iran on august 16 and our reports indicated it was unsuccessful
5837067 it certainly didnt get very far off the ground and it definitely did not meet the overall objectives that the iranians reported the test achieved
5837068 i eked out that last inch to dip him on the line that would have been absolutely devastating to come that close then just miss out i thought i had it with 60 to go then with 20 to go i saw him coming he screamed in despair when he realised he didnt get it
5837069 it really didnt hit me till i started the victory lap and got to the back straight and i really couldnt hold it back any more and broke down in tears
5837070 that you start to believe it yourself i truly did believe it on the start line that it was there for the taking
5837071 this is just absolutely huge for new zealand and for athletics in general
5837072 we have such a rich tradition jack lovelock john walker peter snell three olympic gold medalists and world record holders i was not able to get the gold but with the standard of competition and spread that this sport has reached worldwide now to get a bronze medal to me means just as much
5837073 i feel sometimes like im representing a huge range of track and field fans
5837074 so its just an honour to be able to carry that mantle and reach the medal podium
5837075 i know theres going to be millions of people around the world to whom this means a lot and give all young kids hope that someone from a town like lower hutt of 100 000 people where track and field is not big i come from a high school of 2000 kids and one of only two people who ran track and to come from that and get a chance to be on the medal podium really means a huge amount

5837079 is heavily weighted toward newer releases and mainstream staple titles
5837080 this is not something a tenant should be doing on her own thats why the office of tenant advocate was created
5837081 you may find out the landlord was doing everything right but if not the office is there to help further
5837082 if youre talking about a hallway laundry room storage room elevator or lobby you wouldnt consider it a habitable place
5837083 oftentimes we just simply appeal to owners and management to do what is right for their tenants
5837084 but if they cant do it or wont do it we would have no recourse
5837085 there is an implied warranty of habitability in most jurisdictions essentially the landlord must keep the premises in a habitable condition
5837086 having a yard with high grass probably does not breach that warranty unless there is some type of ordinance that would require the grass to be cut id say the landlord wouldnt have to cut it though practically speaking he or she should
5837087 he who has been fed by another cannot look him in the eye
5837088 i cant see her anointing anyone who ran against her

5837091 any time you try to get something up to the speed of light newton is still god
5837092 there are a lot of ideas that initially you say hey that might work
5837093 but after a little research you quickly find that it wont
5837094 there is a lot of interesting stuff that you cannot do even in the solar system
5837095 we have the technical means to do it but some of the most sophisticated technologies we have not developed not because we cant but because we have not made it a priority
5837096 in this situation the law would not trump the lease that is something the landlord is perfectly allowed to do
5837097 get them out of there now or i will throw them outside in the dumpster

5837117 many of our reservoirs are now half empty and we have to change that farmers are already cutting back and letting fields sit empty because they cant guarantee adequate water
5837118 weve heard from farmers and ranchers around the state who are awfully worried about their future thats why farm bureau is working so hard to find and support water solutions that benefit all of california
5837119 there are people in that town that dont even have enough money to buy a tank of gas to leave
5837120 this was a dramatic and instantaneous cutback in their water supply and at a time when all of their management decisions have been made that was what made things particularly difficult
5837121 and thats hurt a lot not only for the farmworkers but businesses also are suffering
5837122 were facing the worst economic times in our community right now the simple reason is theres no money being spent locally if people are not working theyre not spending their money
5837123 we understand its not going to happen overnight but weve got to start now this is something that should have happened 25 years ago

5837146 by the fact that we no longer commit that sin
5837147 does then one know on what day he will die
5837148 all the more reason he should repent today lest he die tomorrow
5837149 the repentant sinner should strive to do good with the same faculties with which he sinned with whatever part of the body he sinned he should now engage in good deeds if his feet had run to sin let them now run to the performance of the good if his mouth had spoken falsehood let it now be opened in wisdom violent hands should now open in charity the trouble maker should now become a peacemaker
5837150 it is told that once there was a wicked man who committed all kinds of sins
5837151 what constitutes complete repentance he who is confronted by the identical situation wherein he previously sinned and it lies within his power to commit the sin again but he nevertheless does not succumb because he wishes to repent and not because he is too fearful or weak to repeat the sin how so if he had relations with a woman forbidden to him and he is subsequently alone with her still in the throes of his passion for her and his virility is unabated and they are in the same place where they previously sinned if he abstains and does not sin this is a true penitent

5837240 the landlords general duty in this circumstance is to mitigate the damages so re renting the apartment would achieve this
5837241 you cant paint the walls so youre stuck on hanging things on it and textiles on the floor are also good especially if you want to get something you will keep and carry to your next apartment
5837242 if youre just trying to make it look homey a lot of things can be used in terms of adding a little interest
5837243 a nice pattern a textile kind of thing is a quick and easy way to make something your own otherwise youre stuck with posters or prints from museums that you have to frame which can get expensive
5837244 its good to have things that are compatible like a collection of little pitchers or creamers that you put together on a table surface
5837245 whatever the identifying common denominator is if its blue and white then get a lot of blue and white and make sure its represented well in terms of pictures its better to have a series of things that are compatible rather than a whole lot of stuff that doesnt go you can have an eclectic look but you dont want it to look mismatched

5837253 there are some times i still want to hit before i retire
5837254 and i want to try some new events thats whats keeping me going
5837255 i am going to london to do the handover for the next olympics
5837256 and hopefully prepare myself the way i did for these games and be ready to compete in london
5837257 in early june we were told that there was going to be mandated water rationing and that we would only be able to use seven tenths of an acre foot for june july and august
5837258 we said seven tenths of an acre foot in the three hottest months of the year that is going to kill our trees and they said you cant take your water that was a shock and it left us scrambling
5837259 because of the water shortage we gave our trees a lot less water than we normally do it caused the trees to be in stress so i am going to lose money on the crop because it is so light
5837260 my processor stated that we probably lost 20 percent of the crop weight so that is a huge economic loss but obviously it is better than losing your trees so we have lost more than we have gained
5837261 it cost 60 000 but it saved my crop i am now able to harvest my crop otherwise i would have had an economic loss of upwards of 1 million
5837262 ive been trying to get somebody to do a test well for me for the last eight weeks these companies are so backed up they tell me that they have 600 projects ahead of me
5837263 ive been hearing a lot of rumbling that if we do not have a good winter we are really really going to be up the creek that is the news among the local people
5837264 if people cared enough to want to eat good safe food they are going to have to come up with a solution it would take a lot of years but if we dont start now it will never come
5837265 the yield is going to be off some out here
5837266 and then were still trying to figure out where we are going to find some water to irrigate the trees after harvest because post harvest is a very important time to irrigate your trees
5837267 im trying to position myself that if it is a 10 percent allocation next year that i can try to just keep trees alive
5837268 i wont worry about the harvest we will just try to grow the trees as best we can with well water and the well water is not very good
5837269 my workers have health insurance they have 401 k plans and they have kids in college two kids at ucla four kids at fresno state two at uc merced and one at chico state
5837270 i told them that i am going to do everything i can to keep us in water out here
5837271 the tree itself will take water not only from the ground but it looks like it can take it from the nuts themselves so it will make the kernels lighter and it will also affect the bud set for the next years crop so there would be less potential for a good crop the following year
5837272 the big factor is if we continue our drought and continue to have pumping problems out of the delta then we are going to have a disaster on our hands this next year because there wont be enough water to go around
5837273 the delta is the switching yard of california water and it is also an estuary with deepening biological problems against the backdrop of an urbanizing state and increased demand implementation of environmental laws like the endangered species act is forcing us all very quickly into a zero sum game
5837274 increased yield through system improvements like improved conveyance and new storage appears the only way out unless we are prepared to accept large sacrifices of either agriculture urban growth or environmental values
5837275 you are talking about the livelihoods of thousands of farm families and thousands and thousands of farmworkers if this water situation isnt solved
5837276 that is a long term effect if we run into that problem the economy of california is really in jeopardy we have to have sensible logical solutions to delivering water in california
5837277 conservation is no longer just a civic virtue it is fast emerging as a statewide necessity

5837280 the go airlines that have come in i believe are engaged in predatory pricing

5837283 gue putus dari donita dari pihak kita berdua memang kita lagi ada masalah
5837284 kebetulan diskusi dengan saya dia juga membaca sejumlah buku tentang islam
5837285 i was told that the department of justice was possibly interested and looking at go airlines practices but we will see because i dont want to be premature about any options the commitment is going to be there for us to do whatever we can at the federal level and of course the state can do certain things to help
5837286 thats a new thing we found out yesterday we were not informed that we needed to sign up for the nonsmoking ban
5837287 my husband called them right away yesterday and we had no idea we were supposed to sign up for anything with the smoking ban and they said they were going to be sending notices out
5837288 we called to double check because obviously the ban is coming in a couple weeks nobody contacted us to let us know weve done that but it was just our own doing to find that out nobody came to us which we were a little disappointed about
5837289 we will have all of the packets for the businesses delivered here on friday and we will be mailing some of those out and the strip center we will be hand delivering a lot of those that has the signs and the information about who can be exempt and who isnt exempt and then that tells people they need to register if they are going to use the exemption

5837304 the air quality index is currently in the orange level which is considered unhealthy for people in sensitive groups people in those sensitive groups include those with heart or lung disease asthma older adults and children
5837305 when an orange advisory for particle pollution is issued people in those groups are advised to reschedule or cut back on strenuous activities
5837306 people with lung diseases such as asthma and bronchitis and heart disease should pay attention to cardiac symptoms like chest pain and shortness of breath or respiratory symptoms like coughing wheezing and discomfort when taking a breath and consult with their physician if they have concerns or are experiencing symptoms
5837307 fine particle pollution deposits itself deep into the lungs and cannot easily be exhaled people who are at risk are particularly vulnerable after several days of high particle pollution exposure
5837308 fifa today decided that the 2010 fifa world cup preliminary competition match between georgia and the republic of ireland scheduled for 6 september 2008 will take place at a neutral venue due to recent events in georgia which have affected security in the entire country
5837309 fifa reached this decision after closely monitoring the situation in georgia and taking note that uefa also decided to ask georgian clubs involved in uefa competitions to play their matches in neutral countries
5837310 the georgian football federation has until 26 august 2008 to nominate a neutral venue to host the qualifying match against the republic of ireland which will take place on the scheduled date of 6 september 2008
5837311 it would have been very difficult for us to play in georgia for both teams not only for us the first game is very very important
5837312 i am sad about the situation but we cannot do anything about that it is important the teams play on september 6 it is important to continue the calendar

5837337 a lot of christians wonder what their core responsibility is as followers of jesus and though things like faith trust obedience service and the like are all things the scriptures talk about what the bible makes clear is that the heart of our commitment to god and others is love see matthew 22 36 39 galatians 5 6 1 corinthians 13 13 peter affirms this point with pinpoint accuracy but how can we love others in such a way that it makes a difference and how do we actually deliver such a tall order this message will explore this often heard call to love what it is and how to do it and we will hopefully all realize that though the churchs one foundation is jesus christ the churchs single heart is to love
5837338 and he jesus said to him you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind this is the great and first commandment and a second is like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself
5837339 the only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love
5837340 so now faith hope and love abide these three but the greatest of these is love
5837341 anyone who does not love does not know god because god is love 16 so we have come to know and to believe the love that god has for us god is love and whoever abides in love abides in god and god abides in him
5837342 loving one another from the heart commands something which goes beyond the sincere brotherly affection
5837343 i think theyre going to do a good job theyre a real enthusiastic group
5837344 our campaign is most important to the community it ensures that people can give locally and it will stay locally
5837345 we understand whats going on with the economy and how that could possibly impact the united way
5837346 we feel theres no better time than now to get out and talk about the importance of it this is when we need people to be giving
5837347 weve got a good selection of the companies here today
5837348 were hoping to hit 770 000 which represents 40 percent of the goal
5837349 im very happy to see theres a lot of enthusiasm with people that are getting involved a lot of people understand the importance of what were doing here i just cant say enough about this community and how they give to the united way and understand the importance of it it is important if you go visit these agencies and the people that are receiving these services you understand the needs we have in the community

5837356 by all criteria of modern molecular biology life is present from the moment of conception
5837357 it is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception

5837381 hemos mejorado desde mi punto de vista en el aspecto t ctico el conocer a los jugadores el c mo est n el c mo han trabajado

5837389 differential diesel pricing for industrial and automotive sectors is one of the things we are looking at demand needs to be moderated and the oil companies need to be helped
5837390 buying diesel is cheaper for the power companies a 46 per cent jump in diesel prices will change the economics of a power plant significantly
5837391 this meant that the power producers were buying lesser fuel oil and more diesel leading to the unprecedented growth in demand
5837392 but a method has to be worked out to control the diversion

5837397 ive not really had a whole lot to say to tell you the truth
5837398 as to when ill be back on the practice field thats still to be determined obviously the sooner the better for me my goal is to be back for the first game
5837399 this maybe will stop some of the whining going on
5837400 i just didnt want to get into these daily progress reports ive done nothing but rehab i guess were sort of in the rumor mill now i dont wear a knee brace i wore this wrap today really for the first time
5837401 if were to the point of someone putting a cell phone picture on the news thats a little disappointing so i guess ill squash that right now its not true i dont wear a knee brace
5837402 i dont know if any of those injured guys will be out there on the 7th but my guess is they will be

5837416 the task democrats face is to stitch together often narrow majorities in industrial states with victories on the coasts where ethnic minorities and upper middle class professionals weigh more heavily in their support base blue collar unions have declined since the 1970s while advocacy groups pushing minority and lifestyle issues have proliferated reshaping public agendas no wonder progressives have a hard time offering a clear set of compelling policies to economically struggling citizens
5837417 i dont think the economic slowdown will have any impact on the best b schools in the country the final placements too will be smooth

5837419 even if the ppos remain at the same level as last year we would be happy considering that most international recruiters are from the banking and financial sectors hit by the sub prime crisis we do not expect an enthusiastic response even at the final placement stage

5837421 with outbound deals now having outnumbered inbound deals for the each of the last three six month periods india seems well set to become a net deal exporter in the next emerging markets international acquisition tracker in 2009
5837422 this is testament to the growing power of the indian corporate base at a time when everyone is talking about the credit crunch and sovereign wealth funds indian trade buyers have simply continued doing what they have been doing for several years now
5837423 as acquirers they are now serious players on the world scene in sporting terms there is strength in depth here too this is not just about the headline acquisition of indian titans such as tata this is about an ability to strike overseas deals filtering down throughout the indian corporate scene
5837424 its hard to say exactly why this is maybe a lack of acquisitive tendencies insufficient access to cash or debt or simply because sufficient domestic opportunities still exist rendering overseas forays less important whatever the reason is brazil is rather being left behind in the bric charge overseas
5837425 the number of dth tv homes is likely to grow by an additional 11 12 million in a year from now and we aim to have 40 per cent market share of that

5837431 throwing a little bit with kids at the high school
5837432 adventure games role plays arcade strategy games simulations driving games puzzles brain gym we hear more and more about computer games and they are getting more and more sophisticated but what is their place in school are they useful or dangerous opinions among teachers seem to be divided with some enthusiastic teachers using them effectively some sceptical and some hostile what is your opinion
5837433 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
5837434 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
5837435 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
5837436 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
5837437 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
5837438 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
5837439 hell gehenna where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched

5837460 it shows that the line leading to humans is not as special as many thought

5837464 m3 is the best description of how quickly the fed is creating new money and credit common sense tells us that a government central bank creating new money out of thin air depreciates the value of each dollar in circulation
5837465 the coexistence of central and commercial bank monies multiple issuers one currency
5837466 contemporary monetary systems are based on the mutually reinforcing roles of central bank money and commercial bank monies
5837467 at the beginning of the 20th almost the totality of retail payments were made in central bank money over time this monopoly came to be shared with commercial banks when deposits and their transfer via checks and giros became widely accepted banknotes and commercial bank money became fully interchangeable payment media that customers could use according to their needs while transaction costs in commercial bank money were shrinking cashless payment instruments became increasingly used at the expense of banknotes

5837469 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
5837470 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
5837471 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss
5837472 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it
5837473 the determination of the degree of stenosis alone is insufficientto predict patients risk
5837474 the lhc is a discovery machine we dont know what well find
5837475 im actually hoping we find something unexpected that does the job of the higgs
5837476 weve been debating this for 30 years and one way or another the lhc will definitively tell us how electroweak symmetry breaking occurs thats a fundamental advance
5837477 its a tough game you can only do it by statistical analysis since there are other known processes that produce events that can mimic a higgs boson signal
5837478 by itself the higgs is a very puzzling particle so there have been a lot of conjectures about some kind of new physics beyond the standard model supersymmetry has the easiest time fitting in with what we know
5837479 initially well be looking for things that are known standards to make sure that everything is working properly in 2009 we could start really looking for new things like supersymmetry
5837480 these large projects take such a long time we have to start early
5837481 weve been operating it and looking at cosmic ray particles
5837482 nature gives us these cosmic rays for free and theyre the same kinds of particles well see when the machine turns on so it enables us to check out certain aspects of the detector but were very excited to start seeing collisions from the machine
5837483 well be throwing away a lot of data so we have to make sure the triggers are working correctly
5837484 the graduate students and postdocs get to go to geneva but even the undergraduates get a chance to work in a real physics lab and be part of a major international experiment
5837485 there is a high level of interaction and camaraderie between theorists and experimentalists at ucsc which is not the case at other leading institutions
5837486 for me its valuable just in terms of being aware of whats happening on the experimental side
5837487 if nothing were found beyond what we know today that would be so radical because it would be in violation of a lot of extremely fundamental principles
5837488 this implies that the loop has some importance perhaps in regulation of atp7bs activities and we intend to follow up on this in our future studies
5837489 we are trying to understand the regulation of processes that are fundamental to normal cell development and health in humans
5837490 defective cilia are implicated in a wide range of serious illnesses such as polycystic kidney disease retinal degeneration and neurological disorders inappropriate activation of signaling molecules that normally reside at the primary cilium may lead to certain cancers
5837491 ciliogenesis is a fundamental process these structures are found in almost every type of human cell you can imagine
5837492 if we can ever design drugs that will restore the formation and function of cilia even in the presence of cep290 mutations then that would be one way to cure the defects that lead to ciliary diseases
5837493 this is the first study to comprehensively look at a large population of infected persons to study the long term effects of west nile virus
5837494 what it means is that if youve had west nile virus infection meningitis or encephalitis or just west nile fever on average over a year you will normalize in terms of the specific functions that we looked at
5837495 this suggests that arsenic would play a role in the development of diabetes
5837496 but there clearly needs to be additional research conducted because our study has certain limitations we are conducting those studies now but thats going to take a few years
5837497 this is a good base for future research but its a small sample size and doesnt look at dose response
5837498 in terms of magnitude people in taiwan and bangladesh are exposed to at least 10 times higher levels compared to people in the u s
5837499 we were interested in investigating if arsenic exposure at low and moderate levels could be related to diabetes
5837500 when we adjusted for diabetes risk factors and for markers of seafood intake we found this moderate to strong relationship between arsenic and the prevalence of diabetes
5837501 there are still many americans with arsenic in drinking water at levels above safety standards
5837502 this reinforces how important it is that all drinking water is below this standard the good news is that we can actually do something to eliminate arsenic from water
5837503 while the management of tubelines has put much effort into scapegoating the rmt in this dispute by calling their action political they havent bothered to sit down and negotiate a settlement the only guarantee of a quick resolution to this crisis is for morgan and co to sit down with the rmt and listen to the grave concerns the rmt have about the pay settlement for their members in tubelines
5837504 tim parker is the third key figure to resign in less than four months reflecting the rushed nature of appointments and giving an appearance of chaos in the new administration londoners deserve a better deal from the man they have entrusted to run their city
5837505 hopefully it will help the people who run charter schools to take a step back and determine if they have these elements in their schools and if not try to bring them into their schools
5837506 if it helps people rededicate themselves to why they got into the charter business in the first place hopefully to make a difference for the students education then this report will do it
5837507 we are happy to receive recognition but happier to hear one of our children was the number 1 student in norths north high schools international baccalaureate program and is getting into cornell
5837508 were working on how we can take what we learned and implement it for every single kid in every single charter school
5837509 charter schools in arizona can be a critical part of that revival
5837510 mammals can actually move around between these islands and achieve intermingling
5837511 we can use the modeling techniques as a window into those areas

5837525 id just got married we were building a house and then im asked do i want to take a pay cut to become the ceo of a fledgling startup hmm let me think about it
5837526 in a large company you have 100 peers that you can talk to
5837527 youre surrounded by people so you can ask questions be vulnerable you can tell people you dont know what to do next but in this industry it takes emotional intelligence can you identify the people traits that make an entrepreneur a success in technology how do they cope with stress creativity theyre here to turn on the heat or turn out the lights answer 150 emails but still be creative and strategic
5837528 daniel painted a great picture alexei backed it up we had a great story
5837529 now we have to paint on a bigger piece of canvas we need to build a model that is a lot bolder what would we do differently if we had 5 million or 10 million what would i need to innovate with who would i partner with
5837530 whether you like gravity or agree with gravity is not relevant gravity is much in the same way you can either like or dislike globalization it really does not matter globalization just is its a reality
5837531 when i initially saw the reader on the alca sensor i actually thought it was broken because it went to 47 and ive never seen it read that high

5837539 ya no hay luz ni agua s lo elementos de seguridad que las resguardan para evitar que alg n grupo se introduzca
5837540 pues no queremos actuar de manera irresponsable como lo ha hecho grupo m xico con sus empresas en donde no invierte nada en seguridad laboral y prefiere pagar multas
5837541 aqu hay unas reglas que establecen como alguien toma el control de una empresa que cotiza en la bolsa los accionistas chiquitos los han ignorados no saben donde est n parados en este momento
5837542 protestamos por el hecho que se le de asilo a una persona que es terrorista
5837543 es un derecho y una obligaci n humanitaria conceder asilo a alguien que lo solicita cualquiera sea la causa
5837544 lo hemos dicho con toda claridad que de cualquier parte del mundo quien solicite un asilo a nicaragua sabe que lo tiene porque es una necesidad humanitaria
5837545 el derecho de asilo en el mundo no es para terroristas

5837552 movable type 4 took way too long to get out there
5837553 on october 15th we will lose cbs affiliation to wneg but we will gain uga affiliation for wneg
5837554 weve got some really big plans to work with major foundations to develop bureaus throughout the coverage area so that in the end you should see more about toccoa stephens county and habersham and franklin and all the counties up this way and not less
5837555 truly what we want to serve are the information new entertainment needs of our communities here

5837557 10 isnt set in stone sure it could be 11 or 12 or even 15 one day if we got to the point where growing a bit more would help us but it will never be hundreds
5837558 remove accurate negative information from their credit reports permanently including bankruptcies and past due bills
5837559 sales of small cars were up 30 percent were really selling cars but trucks are another story
5837560 the last thing we want to do is overdeploy fixed capacity into the ground where there is no recovery for being wrong by putting in too much
5837561 the ideal way to deploy technology is on the last day as fast as possible because it gets more capable and cheaper every day

5837564 i kind of feel like we are getting a little negative here
5837565 i think youre going to have to think about taking less if you want to sell
5837566 there definitely have been properties that were on the market in july and august that were taken off
5837567 now i dont want to say that was easy but the overall cost of that financing did not increase
5837568 you have to look at a seven to 10 year window not the next three months and that is what these guys do
5837569 after two years you kind of get numb to it it used to make me physically sick
5837570 with all the projects it is going to be a nice mix
5837571 local doesnt necessarily mean small or local doesnt mean new it doesnt necessarily mean put at a disadvantage
5837572 the way that we will approach the leasing is that we want to make sure that all the retail tenants will succeed
5837573 we may want to support the little guy in the neighborhood but if his coffee doesnt taste as good as starbucks if his clothes fall apart when you wear them or his furniture is out of fashion are you going to go his store youre not
5837574 we see companies moving up to reston herndon and loudon county with the arrival of metro
5837575 its an aging costly infrastructure and were always chasing after major improvements
5837576 its all being pushed out to places like prince georges or the dulles corridor theres very little land left and you have a population thats exploding with no space for these service operations
5837577 we dont see demand letting up and theres really very little in the pipeline
5837578 vacancy is up as new buildings are delivering and theyre coming on line faster than demand is keeping up
5837579 theres retail developing in loudoun county and following that is the need for distribution hubs so they can get stuff on and off the planes and get the product to their stores
5837580 everything thats around the university has to be at a certain level thats expected at a world class institution
5837581 frankly the region around the university is not quite there i think everybody would agree to that
5837582 you have this very large very lucrative demographic with the population in what may be the last under retailed part of the washington metropolitan area so its a very strong market
5837583 one of the goals of this east campus project is to help all of the area
5837584 it doesnt benefit if all of a sudden that area becomes a wonderful new town center and we see everything else decay
5837585 there are a thousand permutations on the sandwich in this town but a lot of people want to go someplace nicer when their parents come
5837586 theyll break it into smaller pieces and sell while vornado intends to hold its a very different strategy one is buy and sell quickly and reap the differential the other is looking at a longer play value
5837587 it gives them an opportunity to acquire a portfolio in a city they like
5837588 whats interesting is you have very smart people on both sides of the transaction who are intelligent buyers and sellers in the market they have different objectives of whether to hold assets and take advantage of possible higher rental rates or theyre looking to sell
5837589 we realize we may be the underdog but nonetheless were excited about the opportunity
5837590 no matter who buys it theyre going to dissect the portfolio
5837591 some of the properties will fit with the existing strategy some of it will not they may put smaller portfolios together and try to flip those or flip individual buildings whoever buys it youll see more buildings churn
5837592 at this point we dont have much competition from luxury buildings that are under construction
5837593 most people are waiting and watching theyre buying a bit slower theyre waiting to be able to walk into the unit and see what it looks like when the market was really hot people would sign up from just floor plans or drawings
5837594 now they want to actually walk the unit and get a feel for it
5837595 theyre going to make a decision closer to the date theyre going to move instead of buying farther out everybodys afraid of being the one who bought at the peak of the market
5837596 its going to be a very unique project for the city
5837597 a lot of hotels tend to be very conservative this is going to be a very warm sophisticated upscale hotel
5837598 you can walk easily to dupont georgetown or downtown as it gets developed youre filling in sort of rundown sites and adding to the streetscape
5837599 every building that comes along makes the street that much nicer
5837600 we felt that with the expansion of homeland security and the expansion of the mission of the agencies at aberdeen there would be a growth in contractors who might find that an attractive place to locate
5837601 it seemed like the military connection notwithstanding it was also really good real estate
5837602 we have a number of social goals in terms of providing jobs and affordable housing
5837603 we really are great believers in the importance of rail
5837604 the future is going to put even more emphasis on proximity to mass transit
5837605 we want a place that has a locally owned coffee shop a drugstore or a boutique grocery store like a whole foods or a trader joes
5837606 maybe a ladies boutique or a shoe shop on the ground floor with residential and office space on the second floor we dont want a big box like a kmart or target
5837607 youre three miles from the u s capitol with easy road access and spectacular views
5837608 weve been closed off with a fence around us but we dont want that our land is our greatest asset so we want to create an independent revenue stream by leasing it so we benefit from continued ownership
5837609 where else do you see 77 acres so close in
5837610 its an amazing special place and developing part of it is a unique opportunity its got views great location and a serene pastoral feel
5837611 the city is changing and finding new land is unique d c doesnt have a lot of undeveloped spots its very important to utilize it correctly
5837612 our development would be better if there was complimentary retail and a mix of uses on the other side of n street
5837613 its not a disaster but this is a significant setback
5837614 we spent months and months of great plans of what this area was going to look like with the anacostia waterfront corp and in the end it feels like its every man for himself were going to do what we can to create an area where people come off the metro and they walk along the streets where theres restaurants and stores and a real experience
5837615 in terms of urban streetscape and design youd prefer to have parking garages not taking up two full blocks ideally youd want to see something else besides parking on the ground floor you want it wrapped with retail so activity continues down toward the stadium
5837616 we have a vision for half street se between m and n streets southeast that has the potential to be one of the most exciting neighborhoods in the mid atlantic but that vision wont happen if the process looks like the one that produced two parking garages
5837617 theres a better solution than two parking garages let the private sector do it there are zoning laws already in place
5837618 it would have been nice to have buildings lining the parking but theres so much activity and energy in that corridor that it doesnt make a heck of a difference one way or the other
5837619 this piece of steel meant more to many people than any piece of steel ever
5837620 this cross is a sign of consolation and inspiration to workers who served at ground zero for the 10 months of recovery
5837621 some interpret it as a cross others see it as an artifact that has historical and architectural importance a reminder that is also a sign of closure
5837622 we are all anxious for some type of gods presence
5837623 the west end is an important crossroads literally in the heart of one of the worlds great cities yet with no identities and no sense of place
5837624 were a collection of buildings and we want to create a great place
5837625 we should be on that list of great places in washington

5837629 were thrilled and honored to have been selected from such a fine group of competitors
5837630 its a great opportunity for the district to transform the southwest neighborhood and bring the community to the water
5837631 the area will be primarily residential with cultural and retail venues along with the marinas
5837632 the stakeholders will have a say in how this is all developed
5837633 theyre all qualified but these two hoffman and madison marquette demonstrated the capability to develop a first class waterfront they showed in their experience and their vision that they were the creme de la creme
5837634 many people had become impatient for some kind of development
5837635 it had been a long standing controversy in the neighborhood
5837636 it finally worked out with a lot of pulling and tugging and hemming and hawing
5837637 at this point its very difficult to say what will happen
5837638 it was more responsible for our office not to wait for a last minute disaster but to bring the issue to a head beforehand
5837639 at any time they could have come back and continued discussing the project with us but they chose not to do that
5837640 its a once in 100 year opportunity to be able to develop a site within two blocks of the u s capitol
5837641 thats it theres no space in d c for businesses like us
5837642 weve lost many square feet over the last five to 10 years to economic development

5837649 once again johnson county residents in need will benefit by the countys employees who demonstrate concern for their community
5837650 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
5837651 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
5837652 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
5837653 theres a big part of america that really believes that and that we need to finish up
5837654 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to
5837655 washington d c and the region here is literally setting the pace for how were building our metropolitan areas throughout the country
5837656 its taking it from a project based format to a neighborhood
5837657 the leasing weve seen has been more of an oddity
5837658 its basically years of activity that led up to this
5837659 as far as the next two years youre not going to see a significant expansion of activity in southwest until you have a new administration
5837660 what we found is that the best positioned buildings those with the highest quality of architecture construction building amenities and services were getting a premium rent and getting an exceedingly premium sales price
5837661 the problem we had in selling was that you put it on the market and you scare away everyone
5837662 the people in the past thought theyre nothing but body shop men what do they know well they didnt know who they were dealing with
5837663 everybody wants money dont get me wrong but we didnt like that style
5837664 we hope it will create a critical mass for shopping
5837665 thank you for coming to the neighborhood weve always wanted one
5837666 its hard to find space this big in the district space this big that we can afford
5837667 we want a waterfront that is the envy of the nation
5837668 we want a place that has an urban waterfront and where people can live and work
5837669 our vision is to bring the neighborhood to the water
5837670 our vision is not a mall its not an amusement park
5837671 look unplanned and create something that looks as if its been here for a long time
5837672 even though what was inside was the height of fashion its a 32 year old design
5837673 the history of shaw is a long one of african americans locating here
5837674 were trying to revitalize this neighborhood and make it a destination we really want to bring it back
5837675 were bringing over 100 people to the block with radio ones presence and id say probably 80 percent of them are black
5837676 and theres a lot of culture thats going to be maintained with the howard theater
5837677 development related issues could not be resolved with the owner of the property
5837678 the artifact will be treated with utmost respect but again as a public institution we will not explicitly offer religious services in association with the artifact
5837679 we agree wholeheartedly that this important and essential artifact belongs at the wtc site and affirm that its respectful placement possibly with the memorial museum will be a considered part of our content planning process
5837680 i would like to do everything i can to save this building
5837681 its like saving one of my babies i have a great attachment to my designs
5837682 at first i thought it was very peculiar when i moved into the area but now i really enjoy it
5837683 it piqued my interest to come because its one of the few buildings thats worthwhile to look at in montgomery county
5837684 no consultation with us and no outreach they never approached us to work with them and others
5837685 its tremendously positive to have the lerners as owners because theyre excellent developers and theyll understand that between the stadium and the development surrounding it that we can create something thats a truly integrated district
5837686 just having an owners name is positive in that we have someone who can make long term decisions
5837687 and in particular having someone with development experience and retail experience will be helpful
5837688 theyve created projects that work and theyll be able to say youve come up with an idea thats good or they can say have you tried this the more smart people you have the better
5837689 we havent had the opportunity to see all the plans and discuss with the d c sports and entertainment commission and the anacostia waterfront corp all their plans
5837690 were anxious to see them and give whatever thoughts we might have on them
5837691 we want to draw the tourist the conventioneer and the business traveler
5837692 we want to give each of those kinds of travelers something more than a bed a bureau and a bathroom
5837693 i just fell in love with the feeling of las ramblas because it was so active and it has a center plaza

5837696 that doesnt mean they might not go a little lower but when you look at them from a price earnings multiple and look at them in terms of long term demand we think its a great area to be looking around in
5837697 and other games by changing the look of a character or even adding new bitches temporarily
5837698 they mean a bottle of vodka thats the only way to get me excited about this fuckery
5837699 home prices are becoming affordable again so the decline in prices is likely more than half over
5837700 many analysts do not expect the financial markets to improve significantly until home prices s
5837701 our forecasts focus list contains only two energy stocks both of which are in the oil services sector oceeaneering international and transocean
5837702 while stocks in this group tend to move with oil prices in the near term their pro ts depend more on exploration spending than on commodity prices
5837703 concerns about slowing demand for crude oil and re ned products both in the u s and overseas hav
5837704 we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5837705 we all want to conserve but we all know that conservation will not be sufficient to put us on the road to
5837706 the nation is sending 700 billion dollars every year overseas to countries that do not like us very much when i am president that is going to stop
5837707 but it is pretty clear from the policies hes advocating that hes literally over the barrel when it comes to the oil industry basically bought lock stock and barrel by the oil industry
5837708 we have to drill here and we have to drill now
5837709 until a president is killed in a 300c it can never be as awesome as the lincoln continental
5837710 but to take alobohol rectally couldnt that kill a man
5837711 new drilling has got to be part of our energy solution
5837712 when im president there will be a whole lot more like them not only here in the gulf but also off of our east and west coasts
5837713 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now
5837714 until a president is killed in a 300c it can never be as awesome as the lincoln continental
5837715 but to take alobohol rectally couldnt that kill a man

5837717 the american military did not lose a battle of any consequence
5837718 technically we were not at war we were advisors as the congressional approval to fight in vietnam was not given
5837719 it was a very long thoughtful process on their side with a great level of detail and care involved
5837720 our goal is to maintain the quality brand of service delivered
5837721 you used to have citizens riggs and first virginia all of these great regional banks
5837722 and then we had all these regional retailers like garfinkels woodies and giant and now were seeing real estate companies going the same way
5837723 what was once a market with local developers is now becoming more institutionalized and national in scope
5837724 theres been a tremendous amount of capital allocated to real estate in companies like blackstone and that glut of money is seeking a home
5837725 theyre breaking ground and going up and waiting for the next government defense agency or contractor to take their space
5837726 it could eventually come and it likely will but the problem is that right now with the number of buildings theres an oversupply within that market
5837727 youll be able to go to your office get a meal and live here without having to get in your car
5837728 being this close to the tech corridor and being able to live and get to businesses in reston or tysons corner in 15 minutes versus an hour theres few places that have that
5837729 we had the tech wreck and we were about to sign a 360 000 square foot lease when the commercial market imploded in 2001 and then the condo market didnt mature until around 2003 and 2004
5837730 weve been in a holding pattern for the last five years
5837731 theres always some danger and risk of a lack of continuity with so many jobs turning over at once
5837732 there may be a void for a little period of time but i have faith that the infrastructure of each of these organizations is strong enough that theyll be able to move forward easily when replacements are found
5837733 ground is being purchased and buildings are being built based on where the new stadium is going
5837734 clearly all of these sales werent taking place before thats because a prudent investor doesnt go on rumor
5837735 now that the stadium is a go its giving focus and attention to this area of washington it will give it an identity
5837736 the prices of land in near southeast are so high because the city has said they want vibrant development to happen there and through zoning theyve allowed more density there so that makes it more valuable
5837737 plus its getting to a point where theres less ground left in the district and thats pushing the price up
5837738 this is such a good corner and theres a real lack of services here
5837739 you see new glass office towers going up but no retail and its a prime spot for retail
5837740 we felt that if we buy it and be patient we could do something with it
5837741 it would just be too expensive for us to do it here when we only have a limited amount of time on the lease
5837742 the rent is going to be to the point where we wont be able to pay it
5837743 she sat in one of the houses all day and didnt sneeze
5837744 i would say as these things go this project has extraordinary community support
5837745 they are creating what i believe is an architecturally beautiful community based on authentic architecture that once dominated rockville they are preserving the historic nature of the property i hope this is approved we think its a great thing for our neighborhood and a great thing for rockville
5837746 i think we all agree theres a really positive opportunity here for the community because we have a very important historic resource here which we would like to be preserved and celebrated and made use of in a positive way
5837747 while it would probably be possible to save it im not sure it has any historic significance
5837748 its the newest of the buildings and was not integral to the original chestnut lodge
5837749 in light of not having one major office user we decided to go for more of a town center feel to it
5837750 were pleased the residential portion of the project will double
5837751 weve seen the pretty pictures and heard all the assurances
5837752 this area is finally taking off and its going to become a 24 7 neighborhood thats an extension of downtown
5837753 you had the progression of development coming from the penn quarter area just below the mount vernon triangle area a change in zoning and a frothy residential market
5837754 wars and elections are both too big and too small to matter in the long run the daily work that goes on it adds up
5837755 first and foremost here to look out for the concerns of americas working families
5837756 making a wrestling game is actually really daunting because there are so many wrestlers
5837757 they all have customized moves and it was very difficult to get all the moves assigned correctly
5837758 we dont have all the content the smackdown series has but what we do have is gameplay
5837759 clearly our intent is to compete with the wwe smackdown series
5837760 we want create and grow a franchise that we can release on a yearly basis
5837761 we look for out of favor companies with low expectations that are trading at compelling valuations and to avoid value traps though we exhaust the fundament research process to try to identify the companys potential to generate organic growth expand their margins and generate strong free cash flows we think aspen fits that bill
5837762 the magnitude of the weakness this quarter was a surprise
5837763 egs enhanced geothermal systems could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
5837764 could conceivably be deployed almost anywhere and is essentially limitless in supply
5837765 hey look on the bright side this will be the first time in many years that mtv actually plays music

5837767 on the surface one has to scratch their head and wonder why the city needs to provide 20 million in subsidies to get a high end retailer to go into a strong retail area like georgetown
5837768 a tif is supposed to create incentive to bring business to areas that are underserved or where the market is weak those adjectives dont apply to georgetown

5837770 we intend to enhance the original luster and excitement that made the watergate synonymous with style
5837771 rather than slowly building one tower at a time and gradually changing the neighborhood jpi believes that by designing and building multiple distinct projects we can create a critical mass making an almost immediate transformation

5837777 you dont have a lot of new growth in government
5837778 its a very big deal for lots of folks in this town
5837779 if they are going to stay in washington there really are not a lot of options
5837780 anything with grass has already been built on in the district every blade of glass and this is still by far the cheapest
5837781 we would be delighted to have the department of justice in our building and they would probably make a wonderful tenant
5837782 we are well underway with the renovation of our building
5837783 not a single rescue worker who became sick has seen a penny of this money
5837784 its torturing our people who are sick and dying every day
5837785 the insurance company can only pay out monies if somebody sues us in court and wins a judgment against us
5837786 people who are sick and dying and are losing their homes and cant pay their medical bills
5837787 it was our intent that the money be used to protect injured workers and not swallowed up by lawyers and legal fees
5837788 weve had a lackluster tenant demand compared to what weve seen in the past
5837789 the flight to quality has brought rents up throughout the market
5837790 demand for quality high end space is greater than weve seen in past years
5837791 its tailed off a little bit from 2006 but not significantly
5837792 we expect in the next nine months to see further vacancy increases based on new office deliveries but it wont have a large impact on rents because the demand is still pretty strong throughout the market
5837793 it would be really nice if your suggestion doesnt involve short term and especially long term body modifications like shaving my legs
5837794 it would be really nice if your suggestion doesnt involve short term and especially long term body modifications like shaving my legs
5837795 things are terrible and weve got to fix it but were not going to fix it until we have comprehensive immigration reform when theres a demand theres going to be a supply there are jobs that americans will not do so we have to make it possible for someone to come to this country to do a job that an american wont do and then go back to the country from where they came
5837796 the proposal that we had would require fines would require getting back in the line would require deportation for some it would require others to go back to the country of their origin it would require an enormous amount of time as long as 13 years before anyone could even be eligible for citizenship in this country
5837797 our legislation does account for people who are here illegally it does have an employment verification system and it weeds out those who shouldnt be here and it gives others a chance to remain in this country look this is a national security issue first and foremost what we have done is come together with the president and the leaders of both parties and sit down and figure out an approach to this problem it is a serious national security problem we need to act and if someone else has a better idea id love to have them give it to us
5837798 weve been working very hard for a couple of months with democrats and republicans led by the president and his cabinet to come up with a comprehensive solution and resolution of this terrible problem of illegal immigration one thing we would all agree on the status quo is not acceptable we have to secure our borders but we also need a temporary worker program and we have to dispose of the issue of 12 million people who are in this country illegally this issue needs to be addressed comprehensively
5837799 i will secure the border and i would have the border state governors certify that their borders are secure
5837800 i have always believed that our border must be secure and that the federal government has utterly failed in its responsibility to ensure that it is secure if we have learned anything from the recent immigration debate it is that americans have little trust that their government will honor a pledge to do the things necessary to make the border secure
5837801 we never proposed amnesty but then youve still got two other aspects of this issue that have to be resolved as well we need to sit down as americans and recognize these are gods children as well and they need some protection under the law they need some of our love and compassion i want to assure you that ill enforce the borders first
5837802 very seldom have i seen an issue that aroused this much passion with the american people no one is for amnesty i and the president came forward with a plan that we thought was comprehensive and workable with the priority being border security which remains my position why we failed is because the american people have lost trust and confidence in us we have to succeed because theres 12 million people who are in this country illegally which is de facto amnesty and we need a temporary worker program i commit to securing the borders first we can secure those borders as president i would have the border state governors certify that those borders were indeed secure
5837803 anything short of rounding up 12 million people and deporting them is called amnesty by the opponents of this legislation ill point out that illegal immigrants will have to pay back taxes theyll have to pay a fine theyll have to go back to their country of origin and its at least 15 years before they are in anyway eligible for citizenship
5837804 we have to stop the illegal immigration but weve had waves throughout our history hispanics is what were talking about a different culture a different language which has enriched my state where spanish was spoken before english was in washington dc go to the vietnam war memorial and look at the names engraved in black granite youll find a whole lot of hispanic names they must come into the country legally but they have enriched our culture and our nation as every generation of immigrants before them
5837805 i would like to remind you that we made treaties with native americans such as the navajos in my state where we respect their sovereignty and they use their native language in their deliberations everybody knows that english has to be learned if anyone ever wants to move up the economic ladder that is obvious and part of our legislation by the way is a requirement to learn english
5837806 but a secure border will contribute to addressing our immigration problem most effectively if we also recognize the importance of building strong allies in mexico and latin america who reject the siren call of authoritarians like hugo chavez support freedom and democracy and seek strong domestic economies with abundant economic opportunities for their citizens
5837807 i still believe we have to have a temporary worker program that works and addresses the issues of the 12 million people that are here illegally
5837808 what we have to do is create a comprehensive solution to the problem as president i will make sure that we finally have the kind of border security that we need employers have to be held accountable when we do those things we can take the illegal aliens who are here get them out of the shadows make sure that they are subject to a stiff penalty make sure that theyre learning english and go to the back of the line so theyre not getting an advantage over people who came here legally
5837809 weve got to fix a broken immigration system not just for the undocumented but for legal immigrants because the backlogs are horrendous the fees have been increased and doubled and tripled and as a consequence more and more people are having difficulty just trying to reunify their families even if theyre going through the legal pathways and that puts more pressure on people to go into the illegal system that is something were going to try to pass
5837810 i think its possible for us to be a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants thats what weve always been and thats what we have to continue to be and thats why ive worked in the senate and will work hard as president to make sure that weve got comprehensive immigration reform that has strong border security we need to make sure that its orderly that we dont have thousands of people pouring over our borders or overstaying our visas
5837811 we want to have a situation in which those who are already here are playing by the rules are willing to pay a fine and go through a rigorous process should have a pathway to legalization most americans will support that if they have some sense that the border is also being secured what they dont want is a situation in which there is a pathway to legalization and youve got another several hundred thousand of folks coming in every year that is a central position we should be able to arrive at
5837812 i think that if they are illegal then they should not be able to work in this country that is part of the principle of comprehensive reform which were going to crack down on employers who are hiring them and taking advantage of them but i also want to give them a pathway so that they can earn citizenship earn a legal status start learning english pay a significant fine and go to the back of the line but they can then stay here and they can have the ability to enforce a minimum wage that theyre paid make sure the worker safety laws are available make sure that they can join a union
5837813 we have to make sure that employers are held accountable because right now employers are taking advantage of undocumented workers and weve got to give a pathway to citizenship but people have to earn it theyre going to have to pay a fine theyve got to make sure that theyre learning english theyve got to go to the back of the line so that theyre not rewarded for having broken the law
5837814 we do not deputize the american people to do the job that the federal government is supposed to do so as president i will make sure that the federal government does what its supposed to do which is to do a better job of closing our borders have much tougher enforcement standards when it comes to employers and create a pathway of citizenship for the 12 million people who are already here
5837815 because there are spanish speaking u s citizens who may not speak english well and if theyre seeking help for example on some vital health care question or a senior citizen who emigrated here a long time ago and theyre trying to get their social security check i dont want them to not be able to get those services
5837816 before any guestworker is hired the job must be made available to americans at a decent wage with benefits employers then need to show that there are no americans to take these jobs i am not willing to take it on faith that there are jobs that americans will not take there has to be a showing if this guestworker program is to succeed it must be properly calibrated to make certain that these are jobs that cannot be filled by americans or that the guestworkers provide particular skills we cant find in this country
5837817 there is a public safety concern with denying drivers licenses to illegal immigrants we can make sure that drivers who are illegal come out of the shadows that they can be tracked that they are properly trained and that will make our roads safer that doesnt negate the need for us to reform illegal immigration
5837818 when i was a state senator in illinois i voted to require that illegal aliens get trained get a license get insurance to protect public safety that was my intention the problem we have here is not drivers licenses undocumented workers do not come here to drive theyre here to work instead of being distracted by what has now become a wedge issue lets focus on actually solving the problem that this administration the bush administration had done nothing about it
5837819 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers

5837835 were building a large scale mixed use project thats going to serve a retail starved neighborhood and build moderately priced housing at a transportation hub
5837836 the community is very interested in having a good project come to the neighborhood to spruce up that intersection and bring positive changes
5837837 we dont think our residents should have to patronize the stores in maryland
5837838 we want to have convenient amenities for our residents in a more pedestrian friendly project
5837839 we think if theyre able to attract quality retail to that intersection thats exactly what we want
5837840 until we come up with a plan that everybodys happy with
5837841 worked closely with the developers to understand their project and provide community input
5837842 something fresh to complement the residential were delivering and the neighborhood thats already there
5837843 its located near a mass transit hub and its in a rapidly revitalizing neighborhood
5837844 its not only the metro stop location but the mixture of uses that makes it more efficient
5837845 some people will live there and work there this is a way the city can grow with less traffic impact
5837846 on the good side its exciting to have these restaurants and shops in walking distance
5837847 the mix of tenants is improving making the market less risky
5837848 its not as reliant on large government contractors which are kind of cycling out
5837849 landlords dont have exposure to the 100 000 square foot tenant in a 300 000 square foot portfolio going bye bye
5837850 recovery is not a supply issue its a demand issue
5837851 were not seeing the demand really go gangbusters in that area but it has improved a lot
5837852 the older 70s 80s vintage buildings are becoming less attractive and tenant image is more important to them
5837853 were focusing on bringing in the general services administration along with private contractors theyre doing business with
5837854 my role was to deliver a sense of urgency to both parties and establish the mayors commitment and get the deal finalized
5837855 we wanted to show to both leaderships that we were going to do things differently and work in a more collaborative manner on this project
5837856 once the final transfer is complete redevelopment and design can begin
5837857 all in all this is great news for the southwest waterfront community the district and all its residents
5837858 it has a pleasing gray tone and it weathers quite well
5837859 the technology on how to use the metal correctly has really come together in the last five years he said
5837860 if theyre put up correctly they can last 100 years and theyre fully recyclable
5837861 thousands of office workers look down at the building student housing looks down at the building its a focal point
5837862 the issue is theres not a lot of land and people are going back and looking at older buildings
5837863 its expensive and cumbersome but when the options are to continue moving further and further out in lesser locations and tenants would rather be where they are theres a feeling the owners can justify it
5837864 vacancy rates are low rental rates are up theres not that much developable land available its the perfect environment to think about doing it
5837865 as you get more and more into shortage of raw dirt you have no place to go
5837866 it was zoned in such a way that it could be expanded
5837867 rents were such that it made economic sense to spend the money to add floors
5837868 with tenants in place the work had to be done off hours so not to disturb them which added to the cost
5837869 a pennsylvania address overlooking the capitol and the white house is the d c equivalent of a beachfront address
5837870 this fund is giving us the opportunity to expand our activities in mixed use projects
5837871 the mid atlantic region and the greater washington d c area is a high growth market a diversified economy and we just see a lot of upside potential for investment
5837872 we like herndon just because of the demographic and employment growth this project we like because its part of a mixed use project and the proximity to the retail and restaurants and harris teeter
5837873 this project is a perfect complement to the existing office development a natural adjunct
5837874 they needed the retail and the addition of high end apartment buildings will cap that off there is already a strong demographic base there
5837875 were going to bring homeland security right here to prince georges county and its going to be great
5837876 we can do this around metro centers we can certainly do it around military centers such as this
5837877 theres a lot of total air balls out there proposals that you look at and think this is just never going to happen but thats not the case here
5837878 this is clearly a region where theres plenty of defense contracting and why should it all be on one side of the river
5837879 in fact theres an imbalance in this region way too much overload of every exit from the beltway on the west side of the system and with the new wilson bridge you could see a relocation to the southeast quadrant which is prince georges county
5837880 i think its a good thing even though ill have competition
5837881 i think this is a sign that things are changing in washington
5837882 i think downtown sort of needs a meeting spot dupont circle has the circle theres not a central place here yet
5837883 we have an office market that needs to go someplace
5837884 density is critical were running out of land we need to build up
5837885 ten years ago the air rights above noma were worthless
5837886 most of the people who bought land in noma bought there with the existing height limits but if they came to us and said you can build more wed do it it would be more lucrative but we should have to horse trade and give something in exchange for it
5837887 its come up from time to time sometimes seriously and sometimes not so seriously
5837888 rosslyn has tall buildings and views of the city but if you change the height limit and someone builds in the air rights above the watergate then youve blocked that view
5837889 d c is beautiful because of the height limits if you change that youre going to ruin the view
5837890 were certainly looking at the potential to reposition it as a hotel but were still looking at the financial viability
5837891 it can be quite dead if it were apartments we want the movement
5837892 this speaks to the strength of the hotel market today versus what it was 2 1 2 years ago
5837893 those prices would have been unheard of two or three years ago
5837894 it has a pleasing gray tone and it weathers quite well
5837895 the technology on how to use the metal correctly has really come together in the last five years he said
5837896 if theyre put up correctly they can last 100 years and theyre fully recyclable
5837897 thousands of office workers look down at the building student housing looks down at the building its a focal point
5837898 we need to walk into this bar and pick out the biggest guy in the place and knock his teeth out
5837899 i think a lot of buildings have some degree of art in the lobby but i think theyve taken it further
5837900 its very uncommon i dont think this will be for every tenant but i think theres going to be some who appreciate it
5837901 theres all kinds of development going up in the area
5837902 i think youre going to see a lot more law firms coming down to the east side of k street where the buildings are going up
5837903 we try to affect peoples perceptions of the work environment
5837904 we try to deliver unexpected details this sort of softens the experience
5837905 the numbers are pretty good and until we reach a point of saturation theyre not going to go away any time soon
5837906 these are shows about right and wrong with no gray area plus the guys a character hed fit right in
5837907 theres always been a slow boil for commercial condos for associations in the suburbs were now at a fast boil for that activity in the district
5837908 this is on everybodys lips this is a happening product right now
5837909 but theres always an appeal in washington to have that address for lobbying efforts and other things
5837910 after 30 years of leasing we would be better off had we bought dealing with the realities of the washington d c leases
5837911 the immediate cost will be more in the initial years were fully expecting savings seven to 10 years out well be paying less than if we kept renewing our current lease
5837912 im being followed by some paparazzi and its extremely dangerous
5837913 disney characters presence from 12 15pm to 2 45pm and then from 6 15pm to 11pm
5837914 we advocated that rather than more information on the sidewall better the information be required at the point of sale
5837915 right now that tire efficiency data is not widely available
5837916 cost effective for consumers and the nation to reduce oil use
5837917 the right hand knoweth not what the left hand doeth
5837918 its easier to say youre sorry after the fact than to get it right the first time
5837919 we are pleased the university is pursuing an agreement that would make these records publicly available
5837920 the donors only concerns regarding the collection are due to personnel information that could include names confidential salary information and even social security numbers
5837921 we are not expecting the same level of activity as in the past those days are gone
5837922 but it does not mean this is bad because we are still going to expect some modest growth in activity but not as robust
5837923 e mosca che si sta isolando invadendo i suoi piccoli vicini e bombardando
5837924 la georgia un paravento per altri interessi e tutto questo strillare tradisce la sensazione che la partita non stia andando affatto bene
5837925 come dichiarato da jaap de hoop scheffer segretario generale nato

5837935 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5837936 i asked them why they are taking him they said they are preparing charges of terrorism sectarian killings and displacing people
5837937 my son is a humble man he does not deal with political things he only owns a shop of spare car parts
5837938 i wish american forces had captured him rather than the iraqi army once the iraqi army has him he will not be released
5837939 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5837940 the collective effect of these restrictions is to make any meaningful participation by the aclu impossible indeed allowing third parties to use this court as a general forum to present facial challenges to the governments surveillance activities could cause a flood of litigation that would district this court from its important national security functions
5837941 if the governments request is granted the court wont hear arguments from anyone except the government and those arguments will be presented to the court in secret briefs especially because the new surveillance law departs so significantly from the standards that have applied to government surveillance for the last 30 years any proceedings relating to the new laws constitutionality should be adversarial and as informed and transparent as possible
5837942 the doj is taking an expansive view of executive power and narrow view of judicial power swire told tpmmuckraker in an interview today
5837943 under the governments view the judges seem required to uphold an unconstitutional system because the judges are forbidden from getting briefing from anyone other than the executive branch
5837944 the 1978 version of fisa targeted one individual at a time or sometime one terrorist organization the new approach sweeps far more broadly and it looks more like an administrative system than a traditional judicial wiretap order
5837945 in light of those changes and the constitutional challenges to those changes the court would be well served to be briefed with multiple viewpoints
5837946 i read a lot about how white sugar and white flour should be avoided
5837947 but other than the fact that they dont add nutritional value to your diet i dont see why i should be avoiding them when i get all the nutritional value i need in my diet from the good stuff is it really that bad to eat white flour and white sugar i cant snack on common high fat treats so i go for things like pasta baked potatoes or jelly beans
5837948 my husband and i work out regularly but not together i love outdoor running but he doesnt want the possible knee problems associated with this activity are there any rowing clubs that teach you the method and enjoyment of the sport
5837949 some of these smoothies just have an outrageous amount of calories
5837950 there is a common myth that most people have trouble losing weight and cant lose enough weight to make a difference
5837951 a lot of people will say i was thinking about eating something or other but i didnt want it on my food record
5837952 the next day they are never sorry that they avoided that extra cookie or fast food
5837953 i lost 10 pounds only to gain 20 id lose 20 and then gain 30
5837954 i took the instructions to do this very seriously recording food seven days a week
5837955 the mediterranean diet has been around for thousands of years for a good reason
5837956 at the end of the day satiety is what is important
5837957 ninety nine percent of the time i dont have to pay the bet
5837958 of all the diets that are out there the mediterranean diet has been one of the most studied and it has shown in clinical trials to reduce the risk of heart disease cancer and overall mortality
5837959 but i have no idea which fats are good for you
5837960 to replace bad fats with foods that will be better choices
5837961 less than 20 percent of consumers know that all fat has the same number of calories
5837962 one caution is not to feel the freedom to eat more fats because they are better good fats are not going to help people lose weight
5837963 ive been told to avoid foods that list partially hydrogenated fats on their labels
5837964 yet here comes a product like coffee mate that brags it has no trans fats yet its ingredient is partially hydrogenated whats the difference what can we believe
5837965 if my mom had made paella i dont know if i would have eaten it
5837966 but since i actually made it i wanted to try it and i liked it
5837967 i took the class because i thought it would be fun
5837968 i get really hungry during the day so ive learned a lot about food before this all i could make was cold cereal
5837969 hes really enjoyed the class and made some great strides in eating
5837970 there are a lot of products calling themselves probiotic foods but we dont know if they have efficacious levels
5837971 because theres no stamp of approval where these things have been evaluated by independent third parties
5837972 its very easy to say that all probiotics will work
5837973 but they wont all work and it is a detriment to the industry as a whole to say that there is this sort of generic approach that any product with probiotics will do anything
5837974 they told me i needed to lose half my body weight i just cried and cried because i realized that it was going to take this miracle superhuman effort no one was going to rescue me except me
5837975 if you stop blogging people assume that you are lying in a bag of chips i want to be living proof that you can do this
5837976 this is product extension at its best where the new products ipod and iphone are helping bring new customers to existing computer products the fact that apple is not dependent on the windows vista operating system hasnt hurt either

5837978 consumers can safely enjoy a range of nutritive and non nutritive sweeteners when consumed in a diet that is guided by current federal nutrition recommendations
5837979 please help a vegetarian figure out how to add iron to her diet i got scared and bought some iron pills but there must be a way to just boost the iron
5837980 my wife is concerned that this will put too great a strain on my kidneys i dont have any preexisting problems
5837981 mediterranean and low carbohydrate diets may be safe and effective alternatives to low fat diets
5837982 from a weight loss perspective it all comes down to calories
5837983 but there were only 45 women in the study so dont put too much weight on it because of the small numbers
5837984 the first take home message is that if you are embarking on weight loss start with a low carbohydrate or mediterranean diet
5837985 but it is hard and it is not going to happen rapidly
5837986 teen girls concerns about their own weight about how they appear to others and their perceptions that their peers want them to be thin are significantly related to weight control behavior
5837987 theres a drumbeat about vitamin d that is being played very loudly
5837988 in various populations throughout the world including healthy people in developed countries where it was thought that vitamin d deficiency was obsolete
5837989 there are a lot of benefits to vitamin d that have surfaced in the last 20 years
5837990 the data are still preliminary and not a level where you would make public policy
5837991 we still dont have all the information to go to the next step
5837992 ive spoken with other colleagues and friends who i would have considered to be fairly sophisticated consumers
5837993 some studies suggest that two or more drinks per day are associated with about a 30 to 40 percent increase in the risk of breast cancer
5837994 our findings suggest that the excess risk of breast cancer associated with alcohol consumption may be reduced by adequate folate intake
5837995 suggest that multivitamin use might help to counteract the elevated risk of breast cancer for women consuming alcohol
5837996 theres no conclusive evidence that any vitamin or nutrient can cancel out the adverse effects of alcohol on breast cancer
5837997 no clear evidence that beer or liquor is more or less likely to increase breast cancer risk than wine
5837998 and thats only half the time recommended weve got to do better than that
5837999 this challenge is for everybody whether they are deconditioned and sedentary all the way up to the super athletes
5838000 we believe that there is an activity for everyone to enjoy
5838001 that those who engage in anything for six weeks are more likely to make it part of their lifestyle and a habit
5838002 our hope is that people will continue being active once the challenge ends because they will realize how good they feel
5838003 its fantastic that hes done this because weight loss surgery is taking on such emphasis
5838004 jared supports our findings in the registry that it is possible to achieve and maintain triple digit losses using behavior changes
5838005 i grew up knowing what was healthy and not healthy to eat
5838006 my parents always cooked fairly healthy food and they didnt buy a lot of junk food
5838007 a lot of people think that a plain bagel with jam can be a healthy thing to eat in the morning
5838008 but actually that is one of the unhealthiest duos you can eat because it has a high glycemic load which spikes blood sugar levels youd be better off with scrambled eggs cooked in corn oil or a whole grain cereal
5838009 but what i am concerned about is that some people will think that the exception is the rule so they will eat an omelet on the weekend and then grab a breakfast sandwich on the run on tuesday thursday and friday we dont want people to reverse the strides that have been made
5838010 all the nutritional things that we need to be concerned about as younger adults are even more important as we get older
5838011 older adults can improve physiologic capacity aerobic strength and balance with targeted exercise at any age
5838012 i plan to calculate how many steps ive taken to do the laundry in the last 19 years since we moved into this house
5838013 all of these issues makes the glycemic index sound too absurd and too complex and too variable to put into practice
5838014 but i dont think it is as hard as people imagine
5838015 at one point we thought it had no adverse effects because it didnt raise blood cholesterol levels but now we understand that it has beneficial effects
5838016 chocolate is high in calories and fairly high in fat
5838017 are being paid to render a service for which they have been trained they are no better than their clients patients they are just educated in health care they also need to be taught how to deliver their message to their clients patients in a diplomatic manner no condescending holier than thou attitude they would definitely get better results by pursuing better ways of conveying their diagnoses and decisions
5838018 it also depends on the tone and delivery of the message very few people respond well to being yelled at or scolded they also do not respond well to being demeaned or put down providers also need to remember that the patients behavior is not a reflection on them and that it isnt personal lastly providers need to at all times stay professional with their patients
5838019 i lost 28 pounds in a year and on my annual visit found my doctor had lost the same amount my aunts doctor told her to lose 25 pounds and she informed him that he needed to lose at least 50 neither have lost weight and now he doesnt mention her weight which is not a favorable medical practice for an internist dealing with older patients so docs get skinny and talk about the weight
5838020 is exactly why so many overweight people avoid going to their physicians doesnt this doctor realize that most people regain the weight they lose they need support not recriminations the doctors temper tantrum didnt do anything except make him feel better he wasnt helping his patient at all shame on him
5838021 i dread seeing my primary care physician because i have heart disease and i am 60 pounds overweight
5838022 every visit is about how i must lose weight or else i will have a heart attack or stroke i lost 25 pounds in one year only to quickly gain almost all of it back i am now trying to quickly lose it again before i must visit my doctor and have him find out that i have regained instead of losing more weight
5838023 i was astonished at how many calories are in one krispy kreme doughnut you realize as you get older that to keep a healthy lifestyle you cant have french fries and cheeseburgers every day
5838024 your body is your temple so you want to keep it as fresh as possible
5838025 it may benefit you for years to come and enable you do to what you really want to do physically
5838026 fruit and vegetables and whole grains are all healthier than sweets and fats
5838027 but if you want sweets and fats which ones should you choose if you want cuts of meat should it be ground beef or ground turkey were going back to this notion of helping the consumer decide within the categories
5838028 the factors you use are exactly the nutritional information i would look for if i had time to read hundreds of food labels every time i shop thank you
5838029 i definitely pay attention to the race of my patients
5838030 if i see a south asian man who is young with chest pain i know that the probability of his having heart disease is higher than a caucasian man the same age so i do tend to be more aggressive with those patients
5838031 how do you determine who is actually african or indian
5838032 what we are trying to capture with these crude racial classifications is a greater understanding of risk factors
5838033 people already overweight or obese are at particular risk for packing on the holiday pounds
5838034 we have found that the more your schedule is disrupted
5838035 the more room there is for mindless eating all these environmental cues have a disproportionate impact
5838036 you still want to eat right get some activity and dont smoke nothing about our paper changes those messages everyone would agree
5838037 you see a dramatic increase in risk once you go over 18 ounces of red meat per week
5838038 the old thinking was that these programs didnt provide real food or real life experience and that people who followed them didnt learn anything
5838039 but weve found that you can use these programs to your advantage
5838040 theyre best for those who want someone else to make the decision about what to eat
5838041 they give you an approximation of what a meal should look like
5838042 if you stick with the plan they can work like a charm
5838043 the interesting thing about the conference is that it was co sponsored
5838044 it indicates that the food industry realizes that high sodium food is a real problem
5838045 reducing the amount of salt in processed foods and restaurant foods is perhaps the single most important thing we could do to reduce blood pressure and the incidence of heart attacks and strokes in this country and around the world
5838046 its something that the food industry and government regulators are taking increasingly seriously
5838047 its still tough to hit that 2 300 milligrams of sodium per day
5838048 you want optimal function and every brain cell that god created for you
5838049 in my estimation we are still moving ahead but we want to make sure there is no cloud hanging over the project
5838050 it would be best to clear out the gear before aug 27 because once the ship is here there will be no citizen vessel movement inside the clear zone
5838051 its always been a mystery why influenza disappears in the summertime
5838052 deceptively delicious simple secrets to get your kids eating good food
5838053 the texture was perfect so i stirred in a little more testing to make sure that the flavor didnt overpower the macaroni
5838054 feeling only a little guilty that i was tricking my children i stirred in enough of the squash to feel satisfied that i was giving them a respectable portion of vegetables
5838055 i have become an expert at hiding vegetable purees and other healthful additions foods my kids wouldnt touch otherwise in all of their favorite dishes
5838056 the sneaky chef simple strategies for hiding healthy foods in kids favorite meals
5838057 the sneaky chef how to cheat on your man in the kitchen hiding
5838058 weve had some people who broke my heart because we couldnt get them to pass the medical exam
5838059 it was most sad because they looked upon us as their last ditch effort for them
5838060 we do it because then we are able to script the drama about when people are weighed
5838061 we buy other cuts of meat and grind them ourselves my understanding is that we greatly reduce the e coli risk
5838062 people take out the frozen food break it up and put it back in the fridge without washing their hands
5838063 those are two areas that people overlook disinfecting on a regular basis
5838064 nuke the sponges in the microwave on high for a few minutes to sterilize them
5838065 i always joke that i am not very much fun to go out to a new restaurant with because i end up being pretty neurotic
5838066 for reasons that we dont understand the prevalence of food allergies has doubled in the last 15 years
5838067 leave a little air between us so that she doesnt get jealous
5838068 he shuffles out on stage and then he surprises people
5838069 are there certain things in food that act on the brain and set up a classic addictive process like tolerance withdrawal and craving
5838070 food is like a drug to me it can change my emotional state for many years i have used food as a feel good panacea self medicating with warm chocolate chip cookies or a pint of chunky monkey i will sit down with a food i like in an upset state of mind and will eat it all immediately beyond the feeling of fullness its like a compulsion to finish the entire thing
5838071 i need a sugary treat to get me going and the worst part is i cant seem to stop myself at a moderate amount
5838072 so i either indulge and then feel guilty or deprive myself entirely and feel sad
5838073 thinking about food is like a pounding obsession a hammer beating in my head that is driving no nail
5838074 the obsession pulses with my heartbeat but much more intensely i hate food i hate feeling full im not in control and i hate letting this demon take over me i want to stop and nobody has any idea
5838075 is it an addiction to food or an addiction to eating
5838076 or is it another manifestation of a compulsive behavior like gambling or shopping
5838077 its a fascinating topic but i dont think that its ready for prime time in terms of suggesting intervention or suggesting that this food addiction is a real phenomenon
5838078 were trying to get every physician to prescribe exercise at every visit
5838079 have a moral responsibility to inform patients of the danger of inactivity and the health benefits of being more active
5838080 we are in lock step with them on that concept
5838081 we need to get doctors to prescribe exercise more and we need to get patients to follow that advice
5838082 there are also studies to show that they miss more work and are not as productive
5838083 we know that it works very well we just dont have the proper way to administer it
5838084 i can say that raw milk and home raised meat saved my life
5838085 sick underweight and having an impossible time trying to get pregnant
5838086 i gained weight and got pregnant in less than six months
5838087 we believe that it is a sham to circumvent the law
5838088 involves true ownership and not a scheme to sell raw milk
5838089 we certainly have seen an increase in raw milk consumption over the last four to five years
5838090 my counterparts in other states are all dealing with this issue of people wanting raw milk too it seems like the interest in this area continues to grow
5838091 to eat when you are hungry before you become famished stop eating when you are satisfied before you become stuffed
5838092 why some people do very well on a weight loss diet and others do very poorly on the very same regimen
5838093 the usual answer is motivation and compliance that people just dont stick to their diets but our findings show that biology determines why some people do well on one weight loss diet and not on another
5838094 ending the food fight guide your child to a healthy weight in a fast food fake world
5838095 steak and creme brulee both have a low glycemic load
5838096 but they are loaded with fat and calories you can gain weight on anything if you eat enough of it it doesnt matter what it is
5838097 i figured out how to do this with baby number three
5838098 my most creative way to stay active is during housecleaning i love to put on a cd and dance and sweep at the same time it is a great way to not only get a clean house but get my workout in music makes the cleaning more fun
5838099 my family which includes my husband my 10 year old daughter and myself have a 30 minute dance contest each night after dinner we take turns choosing songs the prize is just plain old pure laughter
5838100 whoever has the most steps at the end of the week wins
5838101 we havent decided on the reward yet but it will be something healthy perhaps a back rub or the winner gets to choose the next movie selection
5838102 even a trained nutritionist can get dizzy comparing foods that have very different amounts of say sodium saturated fat vitamin c and dietary fiber
5838103 simple front label icons could be a real breakthrough in reaching people who are less motivated than a heart disease victim or diabetic to study the several dozen numbers on a nutrition label
5838104 the proliferation of different nutrition symbols on food packaging well intended as it may be is likely to further confuse rather than assist american consumers who are trying to make good nutrition choices for themselves and their families
5838105 the fda should take meaningful steps to establish some consistency to these many different systems of nutrition symbols
5838106 not only is obesity contagious but thinness is also contagious these social networks act like multipliers
5838107 i started gaining weight after i started dating my husband but he also had a big effect on me being able to lose the weight because he did it with me
5838108 and that it was not that much effort or that much change in our lives so he decided to do it with me
5838109 have not appreciated how much one persons weight affects another and what a large effect it can have
5838110 choosing foods that are low in calorie density helps in losing weight without the restrictive messages of other weight loss diets
5838111 the good thing about fruits and vegetables is that it allows you to focus on what you can eat rather than what you have to give up i like that idea
5838112 no organic foods no fresh vegetables we were looking for the cheapest of everything
5838113 we got spaghetti and hamburger meat that was high in fat the fattiest meat on the shelf i have high cholesterol and always try to get the leanest but its expensive its almost impossible to make healthy choices on a food stamp diet
5838114 i have been able through careful planning to feed myself well with enough left over to prepare lunch four days a week for the five people on the staff of my store
5838115 virtually my entire diet since april has been grains and beans certified organic and a mix of organic and cheaper non organic vegetables
5838116 they were easy to make with only three to four ingredients
5838117 f as in fat how obesity policies are failing in america
5838118 theres been a breakthrough in terms of drawing attention to the obesity epidemic
5838119 now we need a breakthrough in terms of policies and results poor nutrition and physical inactivity are robbing america of our health and productivity
5838120 todays children are likely to be the first generation to live shorter less healthy lives than their parents
5838121 is what is being done enough to turn the tide
5838122 that is one of the challenges that faces us now we need a very strong multi pronged approach
5838123 are associated with better dietary intake including eating more fruit and vegetables drinking less soda pop and eating less fat all the things that we want to promote
5838124 no family can do everything right but its one of the things i have found helpful with my own family
5838125 but it wasnt all that difficult either i found it just required the commitment and wherewithal to say no thanks to the late phone call the garrulous client the lingering student my own laziness
5838126 its really important for families to take a good look at what might work for them
5838127 the most successful meals were the ones where my children participated in choosing the menu prepping the ingredients cooking the food
5838128 this is not always an easy thing to do it requires patience compromise a strong stomach but it works like life the messy parts are often the most rewarding but you have to get dirty first
5838129 though the various versions of barbecue differ from each other as much as cows differ from sheep or as much as tomatoes differ from mustard seeds the common themes of wood and smoke meat and sauce family and fellowship transcend regional rivalries and recipe differences
5838130 ive always gotten wheat bread but ive learned that sometimes its just brown colored white bread it has to say whole grains
5838131 dining at home is a lot less expensive than dining out every night
5838132 we gave up all red meat sodas and have switched to whole grains
5838133 we went from whole milk to 2 percent and now use only completely fat free milk it was an easy gradual transition that we made after the challenge
5838134 we chose those things to change in our lives that we could control and be constant with
5838135 theres also no cake ice cream or cookies and no outside foods are allowed in
5838136 there certainly are kids who complain about this or that or wont eat certain things
5838137 but it is an educational process some kids are seeing foods for the first time like spinach pasta or even things like broccoli
5838138 is to keep their body mass index constant over three years so that as they grow taller they dont gain weight
5838139 we dont serve food that is very out of the ordinary
5838140 nobody does so you really have to work with them but when they get to help cook the food and grow it and talk about it it makes it much easier
5838141 there are hundreds if not thousands of papers on tea but the results are often split
5838142 but we have a long way to go before we can confirm the health benefits
5838143 where they drink tea all day long like we drink bottled water
5838144 the research suggests that drinking one to two cups of tea per day may not be enough
5838145 you may need more like five to 10 cups per day
5838146 the foods that are being advertised are the ones that children are going to be asking their parents to purchase
5838147 the institute of medicine and members of congress on both sides of the aisle including senator sam brownback and senator tom harkin have sent messages that they want and expect to see some substantial changes in food advertising to kids
5838148 its also very clear that they are not prepared to mandate changes until they give the industry a chance to do something voluntarily
5838149 there is a lot of talk of companies commitment to addressing junk food marketing to kids
5838150 eat the steaks and the whipped cream but the fish and the fiber
5838151 even a little bit of weight loss can have some positive effects
5838152 people are flying blind at restaurants without calorie information on the menu
5838153 theres no way that you can guess that a tuna salad sandwich has 50 percent more calories than a roast beef sandwich or that the bloomin onion appetizer has more than twice the calories of the fried mozzarella sticks
5838154 or squint at some hard to read poster at the back of the restaurant to find out nutritional information
5838155 that nobody not even dietitians or nutritionists can know how many calories are in foods these days just by eyeballing them
5838156 but if a menu is vague ask the server to explain it is that chicken sandwich grilled or fried when they say salad do they mean greens or just mixed with mayonnaise its a good way to avoid surprises
5838157 help people become aware of the type of fat they are consuming and to help them go out of their way to restrict trans fat and saturated fat
5838158 there are a number of exercise myths out there right now
5838159 a lot of people think the food will make me sick or slow me down when i work out
5838160 but just as you put gas in your car before you take a ride its good to put food in your body to have stamina and endurance
5838161 when youre hungry it means that your blood glucose sugar levels are starting to get low
5838162 you may even wind up burning a little muscle too
5838163 a small piece of fruit is something very light to give your body a little bit of fuel
5838164 you want a simple carbohydrate that your body doesnt have to wait to digest
5838165 the truth is that excess calories are fattening carbs are actually the best fuel for their muscles
5838166 youve just worked out youre warm and sweaty and you cant think of eating
5838167 its not as sexy as having protein powder but it works
5838168 only 11 percent of the population is eating what they are supposed to be eating
5838169 in all surveys black men and women reported lower intakes of vegetables potassium and calcium than their white counterparts
5838170 they want to do whats right for their families but they need ideas and inspiration
5838171 why is high fructose corn syrup showing up in my food
5838172 is there a recipe somewhere for homemade salad dressing that you can put in a spray on bottle
5838173 i said no no no you have to eat fish
5838174 were almost 50 percent more likely to have children with low verbal iq scores compared with women who exceeded the advisory
5838175 think that they should be eating zero to 12 ounces per week
5838176 the top five foods that people say they want to add to their diets
5838177 theres enough science to suggest that adding a little bit of these foods can help
5838178 well if the brad pitt you know is not the hollywood actor but some guy who lives in atlanta its meaningless because im expecting that youre talking about the hollywood actor
5838179 thats like saying that the amount of calcium in a product is a trade secret
5838180 the idea behind an aphrodisiac is that there is a compound that would make people feel instantly amorous or attracted to another person
5838181 it goes back to the idea of the mind being the sexiest organ
5838182 im a junior in college and often find myself craving salty snacks when im stressed and working late into the night
5838183 all the blood goes to the muscles so that youre ready for action and not for eating so stress eating is highly unadaptive and highly strange
5838184 theres definitely an association between stress and mood and increased eating
5838185 loneliness boredom anxiety depression all of those fit in too
5838186 that suggests that theres something more than negative emotions going on
5838187 if you do cognitively demanding work you see a small increase in brain energy but not a lot
5838188 so why would mental work or stress make anyone want to eat more its not like youve gone out and run five miles
5838189 if youre taking a multivitamin theres no reason to stop
5838190 but if youre not taking a multivitamin theres also no reason to start taking one either
5838191 it does represent the recommendation of the panel looking at the best information available
5838192 most people assume that the ingredients in multivitamin supplements are safe
5838193 there is evidence however that certain ingredients in multivitamin supplements can produce adverse effects
5838194 we look for the benefits of nutrients then later we start to think about the possible risks of overexposure there may be susceptible populations do we know who the susceptible populations are probably not
5838195 it really changed things for me i realized that this is how i looked this is how people see me i was in denial about my weight i couldnt believe it the photo was me
5838196 lost and regained the same 40 pounds doing all kinds of crazy diets
5838197 i knew my daughter wouldnt want that i decided to do what i could to live as victoriously as i could in her honor
5838198 when consumed regularly as part of a healthy diet and exercise regime such a beverage may provide added benefits to help in weight control
5838199 it is improper to state or imply that the results of this study support any weight loss or any statement related to this
5838200 the implication is that this will help you lose weight
5838201 the effect of these ingredients on weight is trivial we have told coca cola that if they dont stop making these claims we will sue them
5838202 we have worked very hard to get across the point that we are not presenting enviga as a weight loss product weve said quite the opposite it is not a magic bullet it is a small step that a person can take in conjunction with a sensible diet and regular exercise to help maintain a healthy lifestyle
5838203 the same amount of food as those who regained pounds
5838204 the thing about adding fruit and vegetables to a meal is that it gives you volume
5838205 have so few calories that it is hard to over consume them
5838206 you can get a satisfying portion without eating too many calories and you get the sensory satisfaction

5838208 an unnamed source at an american isp says staff there briefly

5838216 breast reconstruction restores the shape of the breasts but cannot restore your normal breast sensation with time the skin on the reconstructed breast can become more sensitive but it will not give you the same kind of pleasure as before a mastectomy
5838217 its a sense of sadness because after every game last year and after the first two preseason games i had to look at mr blank and know that he deserves a winning team and he deserves a championship
5838218 i was here and couldnt make it happen its kind of sad for me leaving
5838219 now were calling these teams and kind of narrowing the scope
5838220 joe has been so productive somebody like joe and a team with a need should be a perfect fit
5838221 it was just mentally wearing him down more than physically
5838222 im disappointed that joe didnt get an opportunity to compete because of his injury in training camp and his choice not to come to otas
5838223 we really didnt get an opportunity for him to compete were going to move forward we feel very comfortable about the receiving corps that we have i wish joe the best of luck as he moves on

5838225 you play awhile and youth comes along its their time you dont rebuild a team with veteran players i do think you can rebuild with a veteran player who can still play i know i can still play
5838226 theres nothing on our risk list that i would term a showstopper or major issue that we cant deal with
5838227 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5838228 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that

5838231 as peacekeepers or as human beings members of the russian military are responsible for making sure that the territory that they now occupy is free from these ravages against the local population
5838232 i think the reason it took so long to record about a year is because any time i recorded my vocals i always wondered if i was good enough technically to pull it off with just my voice and a guitar still the acoustic style represents me pretty well
5838233 i think every artist is their own worst critic and i found it really hard to be happy with a take
5838234 ron was great to have around he wasnt overly critical but i knew he would never tell me a take was good if it wasnt
5838235 were trying to tell a story and its a little bit of my life story
5838236 the club is fantastic and its a really good thing to have in any community

5838242 eghad how depressing you spend 30 years in a career doing your best for your employer and yourself

5838244 the greens are blocking the very transmission network needed for renewable electricity to move throughout the economy
5838245 only last week duke energy and american electric power announced a 1 billion joint venture to build a mere 240 miles of transmission line in indiana necessary to accommodate new wind farms
5838246 in california hundreds turned out at the end of july to protest a connection between the solar and geothermal fields of the imperial valley to los angeles and orange county
5838247 they say that we want renewable energy but we dont want you to put it anywhere
5838248 why do we have to choose between bush and gore when 200 years ago people chose between adams and jefferson
5838249 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack
5838250 well your mother picked something up at your place she came home and went to bed and hasnt been able to get out of bed for two days she got up had a cup of tea and a banana and i had to help her back to bed again shes got a sore throat and aches and pains and is just miserable

5838254 illusions a 12 metre sloop which means shes got one mast shes white in colour with dark green canvas
5838255 the lower lakes and the coorong are absolutely the responsibility of the people of south australia
5838256 if that place turns into some sort of horrendous acidified environment no one is going to be to blame but you
5838257 youre not going to be able to point upstream and blame the people in new south wales or the feds its actually your stuff and something you have to take carriage of in my view
5838258 i remember when i was working here with the state government saying look at perth look at the desal plant in perth and see what its done for that city

5838260 when it comes to supplier diversity arvinmeritor has set aggressive targets for on going investments with minority suppliers while were making good progress we still have room for improvement

5838264 the fcics approval of agrisure and other traited corn seeds acknowledges reduced risk for growers
5838265 we worked with john deere risk protection to create a better opportunity for growers to access crop insurance discounts a unified endorsement aligns with growers preferences for choice and the crop insurance industrys need for consistent policies across seed brands
5838266 the approval of this endorsement by the fcic should spark additional discussions regarding how technology can impact risk reduction regardless of the technology provider
5838267 we look forward to conversations that take into consideration the value of choice for growers importance of market competition and implementation considerations faced by the crop insurance industry
5838268 we applaud the work of syngenta john deere risk protection and the fcic and rma in extending access to the risk management biotechnology endorsement to growers across a wider portion of the corn belt
5838269 we are pleased to announce record revenues for the year but obviously are not happy with the net income for the quarter or year license revenue fell off dramatically for the quarter compared to last year and slightly for the year which had a significant impact on both top line revenue and gross margin our support and services revenue continues to grow at a very healthy pace driven by our electronic processing services which include atm debit card bill payment and remote deposit capture our managers and employees continue their on going focus on our customers while also maintaining a focus on cost control during this challenging period
5838270 we continue to develop new products and enhance the features and depth of functionality in our existing products to meet our customers demands which also allow them to effectively compete with any financial institution obviously this means we have to continue to increase our spending on research and development which increased significantly for the quarter and the year however considering the impact of the two acquisitions we completed last year this line of expense only increased organically by 5 percent for the quarter and 15 percent for the year compared to the same periods a year ago
5838271 we believe these demands are a good sign that our customers look to us to fulfill their technology needs as we continue to focus on our primary strengths of providing the most powerful and flexible technology in the industry and our commitment to provide our clients with outstanding service
5838272 our managers did a good job of controlling our operating expenses during the year we had a one time write off of some fixed assets and above usual level of legal and accounting costs in the fourth quarter or the total dollar expense would have been basically flat for the quarter and those combined with additional personnel costs and higher user group costs caused the increase for the year compared to the prior year periods also selling and marketing expense increased at approximately the same pace as revenue for the year but considering the impact of the companies acquired during the year they only increased 5 percent and 7 percent organically for the quarter and year respectively
5838273 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5838274 its just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life
5838275 i was already getting up and elated coming off the turn because i know how my races usually go i just had a really tough break on that one
5838276 why should it be spoiled unless someone tries to spoil it for me
5838277 im going to out there to run my heart out
5838278 it was like racing a car at max velocity when you hit a curve you either maintain control or you crash and burn
5838279 today i crashed and burned im shocked and sad but im happy for the girls
5838280 i kind of felt like she was me for a minute there
5838281 its heartbreaking because i saw her face afterward i know the feeling i know how she felt
5838282 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5838283 targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
5838284 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
5838285 they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious
5838286 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5838287 its important to remember that we are all engaged in a serious effort to bring about a stable afghanistan
5838288 france will continue to assume its responsibilities in favor of a democratic and peaceful afghanistan and in the fight against terrorism
5838289 we are delighted to have jessica allmand join mcdonald hopkins

5838292 the lucky jack project is one of the largest high grade undeveloped molybdenum deposits in the world with a historical mineral resource in excess of 700 million pounds of molybdenum
5838293 as with any project of this magnitude there are challenges
5838294 naturally we will review the details of the project and take a fresh look at all aspects of the previously planned development and we will seek the input of the residents of the county in addition we will work as we always do with local state and federal officials and agencies to ensure that the project is developed in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations fortunately our company has the experience and resources to develop and ultimately reclaim the property in a professional efficient and environmentally sound manner
5838295 the facts are clear and unfortunately its becoming more and more obvious the status quo is not working america is not a sexually healthy nation for this to change we must acknowledge this reality and embrace the important role condoms play in maintaining ones sexual health
5838296 by drawing attention to this issue on such a grand political and social stage were hoping to give renewed voice and attention to the simple fact that condoms play a critical part in advancing the sexual health of america

5838298 there is no direct evidence that momin khawaja had any knowledge of the london fertilizer bomb plot
5838299 we recently received enquiries as disclosed in the august 14 2008 press release from the united states securities and exchange commission about accounting matters in our december 31 2007 form 10 ksb and our form 10 q for the interim period ended march 31 2008 in consultation with our auditors deloitte amp touche llp we have agreed to amend certain historic filings we are unable to complete the changes to our recent filings and have our auditors complete their necessary procedures within the grace period under sec rule 12b 25 for this reason the company is unable to file its form 10 q for the interim period june 30 2008 on a timely basis we anticipate that our trading symbol will be flagged as a non timely filer until we are able to bring the filings current which we believe will be before the end of august we do not believe these amendments will have a material impact on fiscal 2008 earnings our scheduled conference call for august 20 2008 will take place as originally planned

5838313 it is always good to go out of these kinds of matches with a win
5838314 i am happy physically because i am fine coming out of this match
5838315 i am definitely thinking the body is not holding as well as it used to
5838316 thats a fact and it is pretty frustrating but that is the way it is
5838317 this could be for me an opportunity to get back into the highest level
5838318 it is going to be a matter of really taking the opportunities if they show up
5838319 i think that was the biggest thing coming in and getting used to what goes on in the clubhouse
5838320 thats made all the difference helping me relax and be out there and pitch
5838321 he hasnt felt the pressure to win every start hes just done it
5838322 it feels like hes been with us for six years
5838323 im just trying to go out and keep us in games and help the team win
5838324 we score a lot of runs and i know if i can keep it close at some point in the game were going to score runs
5838325 when you go out and make a move like that for a guy like sabathia who is last years cy young ward winner and a guy who is a proven big time winner if thats not an impact on your team and the town youre playing in nothing is
5838326 hes not a vocal leader but watching him pitch the guys the players his teammates enjoy watching him pitch as much as i do as much as the fans do
5838327 the one thing were learning is that it does take a no 1 starter pitcher like him and a no 1 or 2 type like ben sheets
5838328 not many of those guys sign though not many guys sign
5838329 theyve got to play the market game and we understand that
5838330 he could just sit there and go well im going to be here for three months im here to pitch im here to win games and thats it
5838331 but hes a great teammate and i think a lot of people enjoy having him around
5838332 he told me keeping doing what youre doing youre going to be fine thats always good to hear
5838333 i asked ned if i could go back out and he let me

5838348 as well as being useful domestic science can help to save money but now we have two generations of children who have not been taught even the basics we are losing vital life skills
5838349 we learned how to bake french bread pizza and use a sewing machine i had the boxers i made they were a frog print fabric for years afterwards
5838350 the idea was that we would learn to use a sewing machine but all the machines were broken and they couldnt afford to fix them so i hand sewed a stuffed bunny and learned the invaluable skill of pulling stuffed animal fur out of a seam shop class was way more awesome i learned to use a jigsaw
5838351 i sewed an ugly sweatshirt that i wore to gym class for years but i also learned how to sew buttons and stuff like that

5838372 ich habe gefragt ob es stimmt dass dieses wappen dort ist das regiment general g ring war eine richtig ble truppe beteiligt an der niederschlagung des aufstandes im warschauer ghetto an kriegsverbrechen in italien an der verfolgung von widerstandsk mpfern die bundeswehr darf nicht in dieser tradition stehen das wappen muss entfernt werden
5838373 das kaminzimmer ist ein kleiner unscheinbarer durchgangsraum offizielle veranstaltungen finden dort nicht statt jetzt wird untersucht wie weiter verfahren wird
5838374 jedes tor was ich seit dem tod meiner mutter schie e widme ich ihr jeder treffer ist also auch ein teil von ihr meine mitspieler haben mich gegen bremen bejubelt mir aber war zum heulen zumute meine mutter war meine beraterin in allen lebenslangen mein gro er r ckhalt in guten wie in schlechten zeiten dieser schicksalsschlag hat aus mir einen anderen menschen gemacht
5838375 gott hat mir erlaubt meine mutter am sterbebett zu verabschieden als ich bei ihr im krankenhaus in posen sa wurden mir die augen ge ffnet ich muss bei einigen dingen erwachsener werden es gibt sachen aus der vergangenheit die nun so sinnlos und unwichtig erscheinen das will ich sofort abstellen ich suche nun meinen inneren frieden ich wei jetzt was schmerzen bedeuten und m chte mich mit allen leuten denen ich mal irgendwie weh getan habe vers hnen
5838376 ja manche rundumschl ge sind mir jetzt selbst unangenehm herr hoene und ich haben uns fter gefetzt beide seiten waren voneinander entt uscht wenn es die zeit in berlin erlaubt m chte ich mit herrn hoene ein gespr ch f hren und alle sachen aus der welt schaffen wir sind beide menschen sprechen dieselbe sprache das bin ich ihm schuldig

5838379 last wednesday morning someone remarked on the fact that the photo had changed on my wikipedia page and i looked sure enough there was a new pic there one that had been taken only several hours before
5838380 well lets see it was taken at the l a convention center on that day that i had two days growth of beard because i hadnt shaved and i was behind on sleep i was clearly taken from across the table and i remembered you snapping the camera at that moment is that enough
5838381 absolutely not what if there were someone behind me with a telephoto lens who managed to take a photo within a split second of when i got that image
5838382 i guess you never will know anyway you hated that other picture remember this has to be better beard or no beard
5838383 the catch is that it applies to volume licensed server applications so individually purchased applications would not be covered
5838384 you have to double your software licensing investment to run the os as a virtual machine
5838385 the new licensing is a great first step it is something nei as a data center will be able to leverage but for isvs it isnt enough microsofts volume licensing model is for it in data centers only so it doesnt do much for our customers who are software developers
5838386 the financial impact of this announcement for most organizations is probably negligible many it shops simply ignored the 90 day license transfer restriction and had never taken the step to purchase additional licenses for the sole sake of virtualizing a microsoft application
5838387 i think many enterprises will appreciate the application licensing flexibility that your policy change has provided
5838388 lifting the 90 day licensing transfer restriction across all product lines is simply the right thing to do
5838389 reconoce la importancia actual y el potencial del turismo deportivo como una de las actividades de mayor crecimiento para el turismo
5838390 gentlemen you cant fight in here this is the war room

5838397 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5838398 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5838399 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5838400 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5838401 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5838402 the position of the allies is very clear and very firm
5838403 there was a strong regard for the territorial integrity of georgia the importance of georgian democracy and respect for human rights in georgia
5838404 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5838405 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5838406 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5838407 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5838408 this alliance is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5838409 there will absolutely be no new line and nato does not accept that there is a new line
5838410 noyes has threatened to kill me and my family and will not rest until we are dead all the evidence you need is in his computer and that little girls mind please save her

5838419 im not worried about any of that other stuff right now im just trying to take advantage of what i can control right now
5838420 reps are cherised in this league as quarterbacks so every single rep whether it be a game or practice i try to make the absolute most out of so these reps have been great obviously everyone wants to play so you just try to make the most of every single one of them
5838421 weve had 75 successful years here through thick and thin and just one day a year we have to do this and this was a good starting point
5838422 wed love to do it every year until we hit 100 and then well see where we go from there
5838423 training camp is like summer camp when you are a kid except you have to hit people real hard and you get real tired and then you have to sit in the ice bath every day but its time to get better and i want us to develop a cohesive unit on the line and make sure that my calls at center are understood all across the board and then also get my technique down so that im ready for the season
5838424 i need no lectures about building things in brandon the people in brandon know

5839078 more than 20 dollars clearly shows that there has been speculation in the market
5839079 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5839080 the price must be maintained at a level close to us100 because the costs have increased
5839081 the market is reacting to reports that opec may cut production
5839082 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5839083 oil has lost its bullish mojo and it may take a major event or a great technical stand to go get its groove back
5839084 the same way this market seemingly overreacted to every bullish nugget of information on the way up it is now ignoring those same nuggets on the way down

5839086 de provincie groningen heeft fantastische karakteristieke landschappen maar nu wordt alleen gekeken vanuit het oogpunt van de automobilist

5839091 this year is more ominous the gap is extending detroit is falling its all foreign at the top and all american at the bottom
5839092 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5839093 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5839094 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction

5839116 i really thought we could win something this year but its not to be
5839117 against lincolnshire we had a very bad game we then had a bad hour in the match against oxfordshire in the cup and that has been the difference
5839118 on the whole we have played some very good cricket we are a really close unit
5839119 we look for consistency in selection but injuries and unavailability is always a problem
5839120 the lads who have come in have done well i never felt we were carrying anyone they have stepped up to the challenge and that is good for the future
5839121 we were very good and showed what we are capable of
5839122 we outplayed them in all departments if the batting performs then we know we have the attack to win games
5839123 gareth morris is bowling really well and everyone has backed him up
5839124 mo sheikh is a different class he has got better and better he is a quality player who is capable of taking games away from teams
5839125 peter wilshaw has really upped his game he is much more mature and is now a dominant figure at the top of the order it is really pleasing to have finished the season so well
5839126 apart from one week in june when we lost to lincolnshire and oxfordshire we have played pretty well
5839127 this administration has a horrible record when it comes to transparency

5839132 my shopping budget is always 0 how can i incorporate the latest trends into my boring wardrobe
5839133 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
5839134 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
5839135 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5839136 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5839137 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
5839138 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
5839139 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
5839140 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
5839141 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
5839142 the 200 is my better race the 100 was to feel the energy of the track
5839143 i have a lot more confidence in the 200 so i wouldnt mess up because this is my race this is what i know this is what i love
5839144 my focus is to get through the rounds send a statement knowing this is the race i came here for
5839145 i wanted to run a good 100 but my focus wasnt really on the 100 its 100 percent on the 200 meters my aim in all the rounds is to win or get top three but to make it through the rounds
5839146 theres no pressure when i go out there thats what i train for thats why i do repeat 600s all my background training is just for the rounds
5839147 so theres no pressure going through the rounds ive competed with all these girls before so personally theres no pressure i just have to go out there have fun and do what i was trained to do
5839148 from what i see to get into the finals will take at least a 22 4 or 22 5
5839149 the 200 has a lot of competition with the three americans and the three jamaicans especially with the americans running under 22 5 you also have the russians and cydonie mothersill cayman islands theres kim gevaert belgium the french girl muriel hurtis she has pressure in the 200 but she can keep up shell have to run a personal best to make that final
5839150 i couldnt get in contact with my coach because of the time difference so i ran off what we had been talking about i really had no game plan to my run and i just wanted to sit behind jeremy
5839151 there were two guys behind me that ran 45 flat this season so i was praying i got second or third in my heat i was watching the big screen and seeing how people were dying at the end and i didnt want to put too much out in the beginning so i conserved a little but i think i can go faster in the semis
5839152 weve got all the confidence in the world in him and he has the confidence in us and that was big today believe me really really big today
5839153 i know everybody at home got to see him on television since he was in the heat with jeremy wariner and you know they will show usa he prepared well the coaches at barton community college did a good job with him and i just try not to mess him up the goal right now is to get through the rounds and to hit that 44 plateau
5839154 i aint holding anything back crash or no crash im going all out
5839155 i can get third in my heat from what it looks like with chris brown bahamas and jeremy in there im looking at nobody else but them ill run my race finish strong and hope for a personal best and a qualifying time too
5839156 oh no oh god im sorry i umm oh no
5839157 this had better be good and think yourself lucky i don throw you out in the street looking like you do right now
5839158 look i have to admit that like most guys i have my slightly perverted side we all have little things that excite us and in my case i have a bit of a hing for pantyhose and high heels always have had as long as i can remember and of course i see you a lot and i cant help but take notice of what you e wearing especially when it comes to what turns me on
5839159 that would explain why apart from all the girls you were the only guy who ever commented on when i was wearing new stuff especially shoes then
5839160 anyway i knew it was wrong but with you away i couldn resist taking a look in your wardrobe at first it was just a look but then the desire to try them on overtook me and i suppose i just lost myself in the moment and well here we are
5839161 i assume you think im some sort of ultra strange pervert now and maybe i am but you e an attractive girl and combine that with the attraction i felt to your hings well i couldn help myself ill just take this stuff off and go
5839162 look don worry i had always noticed that you took more notice of me than maybe you should have but now i understand a little more its no big deal and to be honest it actually turns me on a little
5839163 i know this is wrong for both of us and you need to understand that this is strictly a one off thing but i desperately want to fuck you right now i want to have some fun because this is something we may never get a chance to do again you don need to worry this is our secret i might ask you to do some things that you might not like even but today is a time for experiments so just go with me and enjoy
5839164 hmm a little tight but otherwise a good fit really aren you a lucky boy
5839165 umm hang on im not really into this sort of thing i mean im not gay or
5839166 i told you that there might be some buttons pushed today ive let you indulge in what you want this is what natasha wants
5839167 thats it my boy let me fuck your hot little boy ass
5839168 do you want to cum baby do you like this
5839169 ok that was a lot of fun and i think you nearly drowned me
5839170 hmm these are a little wet too aren they you naughty boy
5839171 these are yours now oh and you can keep the other stuff that you e wearing too next time you feel the need you can pleasure yourself and think of me at the same time
5839172 i know that it all turns you on and its ok with me now i can tease you a little too ha
5839173 it was a once off remember but that doesnt mean that i wont remember it
5839174 my doctor has advised me not to travel in the short term and so regretfully i am unable to attend what will surely be an historic convention in denver

5839176 on behalf of my family and our virgin islands community i offer condolences to sgt james family and friends the loss of a loved one is always difficult to bear especially when the death is unexpected the virgin islands has lost another young man who sought out a career in the armed forces and was doing his part to protect the freedoms we all enjoy as american citizens
5839177 to his family i wish gods comfort during this time of extreme grief it isnt easy to deal with this but i know that sgt james will always be remembered as a virgin islands and national hero even in death he displayed the patriotic spirit of which our country was founded

5839190 this is a world experience to see our two athletes tahesia harrigan and eric matthias perform and their competitions were awesome for us it was an experience and a challenge i know they have a long way to go but they both did their best under the circumstances
5839191 the key here from what i noticed is lots of networking relationship building and this is growth for the athletes we have participating the bvi olympic committee must be commended for bringing our country to this point in such an event it is our country i see out here being exposed and everyone will learn about the bvi through our two athletes

5839224 said one of fannie maes achievements in 2006 was expanding its involvement in the market for subprime and other nontraditional mortgages
5839225 internal documents show that even late in the housing bubble fannie mae was drawn to risky loans by a variety of temptations including the desire to increase its market share and fulfill government quotas for the support of low income borrowers
5839226 fannie mae documents from the period obtained by the washington post paint a picture of a company with the dual incentives of fostering affordable housing and making money and of one caught between the imperatives of increasing its market share while avoiding excessive risk
5839227 fannie mae aimed to benefit from subprime loans and expand the market for them and hoped to pass much of the risk on to others documents show along with subprime loans which were typically issued to borrowers with blemished credit the company targeted so called alt a loans which were often made with no verification of the borrowers income

5839310 how does someone that rocks this hard sing so damn sweet
5839311 took you out of playing baby guitar and made you play it like a man
5839312 im really happy with how these two days have gone
5839313 the changes we made have proven to be very positive and allowed me to take a couple of tenths of my time from yesterday on a new experimental tyre
5839314 bridgestone are doing a great job but more than anything im pleased with the new set up which has improved all areas of performance and will be useful for the next race
5839315 i tried two new qualifiers as well but to honest i wasnt pushing them that hard because at the moment im not concerned by our qualifying performances i just want to concentrate on how to improve in the races
5839316 its been a long day but weve found some important improvements so its been worthwhile
5839317 im leaving here very happy because weve worked on the electronics and it seems weve found some improvements under acceleration
5839318 weve improved our performance a lot in comparison to the race
5839319 but we cannot forget that we are far from where we want to be so we cannot give up
5839320 weve been able to find some time now we have to work with san marino in mind because we really need to change our situation there and finally have a good race
5839321 the supervised injection site undercuts the ethic of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada
5839322 this is a profound moral issue and when canadians are fully informed of it i believe they will reject it on principle
5839323 junkies and pushers dont belong near children and families they should be in rehab or behind bars
5839324 there is growing evidence that harm reduction efforts can have a positive effect on the poor health outcomes associated with drug use
5839325 is it true that supervised injections offer positive health outcomes i would not put it this way insite vancouvers safe injection site may slow the death spiral of a deadly drug habit but it does not reverse it i do not regard this as a positive health outcome
5839326 minister is off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians
5839327 we have an opinion based on scientific evidence the minister has come to a different conclusion
5839328 ive never seen such an offensive performance by a health minister
5839329 how dare he come to a meeting of professionals and scold them about their perceived ethical failings
5839330 remain open with a changed mandate of prevention and treatment instead of drug maintenance
5839331 injections are not medicine they do not heal we need to offer them healing
5839332 thugs drug pushers and others involved in the drug trade are writing their own rules for too long lax liberal governments left gangs and drug pushers to make their own rules and set their own criminal agenda those days are over
5839333 this message goes beyond what ought to be an acceptable 10 per center
5839334 whats questionable is the ethics of a government that would allow vulnerable people to die without getting help
5839335 youre debating a policy and youre asking which political party or which political leader is on the right track
5839336 i had that dream really from the day i first walked into my first full time job as a games programmer
5839337 thats a little bit of the darker side but on the positive side weve created our own original ips consistently some are great some are not so great but the fact is you have to keep throwing darts at that board
5839338 any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both

5839344 what is more important is to find means by which we can redistribute our economic gains to the benefit of all
5839345 there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
5839346 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development
5839347 certainly there is no limit to taxation if the benefits derived from public services by society measure up to the cost in taxation which they have to pay
5839348 it is a fallacy to say that there is this limit and it is a fallacy to rely mainly on individual free enterprise to get the savings
5839349 tax laws that restore some balance to the distribution of the nations wealth
5839350 we can only compete if our government makes the investments that give us a fighting chance
5839351 and if we know that our families have some net beneath which they cannot fall
5839352 if left to the individual consolidation will take a long time to come we have to look at priorities in terms of what is good for society and on this basis we may find it necessary to force people to do things they would not do otherwise
5839353 the government should restrict the size of farms that can be owned by one individual throughout the country
5839354 one who has read marx cannot fail to see that corporations are not only what marx referred to as the advanced stage of capitalism
5839355 but marx even called it finance capitalism by which a few would control the finances of so many and through this have not only economic power but political power as well
5839356 we hold them up as role models and our mythology is steeped in stories of men on the make
5839357 the problems of poverty and racism the uninsured and the unemployed are rooted in the desire among those at the top of the social ladder to maintain their wealth and status whatever the cost

5839365 you want me to the tell the president of a country of 1 3 billion people you should do this and do that but i dont dare to say what to do to the premier of sask you have to put things in perspective
5839366 we did not pass as the newest little dog of the united states
5839367 you cannot gather signatures in a park you have to go door to door
5839368 demonstrates that the system is woefully short of transparency and has no recognizable requirements for accountability

5839374 dial 911 and dont attempt to throw the phone at me or do anything bad or ill just shoot you
5839375 if we dont drill where will we get the oil to refine
5839376 so you think big oil is pretty much unregulated they get to do whatever they want whenever they want to do it
5839377 well did you see a trial for john lennons murder they own the media

5839383 mr obama appeared before the v f w a day after his presumed republican opponent senator john mccain criticized him for advocating a policy of defeat in iraq and suggested mr obama put personal ambition before the interests of the country mr obama struck back with tough language although his delivery was largely without passion he received a polite but not enthusiastic response from the estimated 3 000 veterans assembled in a cavernous convention hall here many seats were empty because a number of veterans left orlando ahead of the advancing tropical storm fay
5839384 obama paid the obligatory homage to mr mccains military service and sacrifice as a vietnam prisoner of war but then raked him for impugning his motives and patriotism
5839385 the risk jack was that if the war had gone as planned obama would of had a tough time running for dog catcher
5839386 theres so many global leaders based outside of the u s it seems more and more that limiting yourself simply to the u s doesnt make much sense
5839387 we feel that they are a little too expensive for us
5839388 it only made sense for me to invest in some of these things
5839389 its the right thing to do and its at a point where i think these technologies are really going to pan out
5839390 there is a dramatic increase in the number of investment managers looking at their investments in a different way than they have previously
5839391 you may get less of a return but even if you do you are putting more into the things you care about
5839392 what happens is a perverse form of market timing rushing in at high prices and panicking out at low prices
5839393 its a mistake for you to assume you know what is going to happen in the market in the future
5839394 if you were biting your nails during the last downturn it might be a sign you need to diversify if youve got a lot of money in emerging markets or small cap stocks quit it or at least dont put any more in
5839395 in good times everyone does well when the economy slows the strong companies tend to do well
5839396 quality is what you want when the market softens especially if you are investing for the long haul
5839397 i think an investigation is clearly warranted and congress must stand ready to act pending the results of the investigation
5839398 we will seek a vote to require it to happen
5839399 its essentially saying we want the right to politicize this and by implication any other cfius review
5839400 and yet the law was scrupulously framed as to make it a nonpolitical determination
5839401 have exercised the power of eminent domain for the purpose of acquiring private property for conveyance to private entities for commercial or other development to fight blight and other decay and it is anticipated that they will continue to do so in the future
5839402 limit the use of eminent domain to the state or political subdivisions whose officials are directly responsible to elected officials
5839403 i wonder if the politicians who approved this legal action have considered how many residents of their cities signed our petition

5839411 in spiritual terms that life exists at the edge of chaos means that the conjunctive church will emerge only when it has located itself between rigid fundamentalism and anarchic liberty christ s incarnation was god s radical repositioning of himself right on that edge a vulnerable child in a chaotic world as we seek the church s re incarnation we must seek to position ourselves in the same dangerous place of complex life
5839412 i believe we are connected to the creator irrevocably by a story a true story that begins with the words in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth a story that ends with behold i make all things new this story that begins and ends with creation is all about creation in between its beginning and end this story we find ourselves in

5839416 all these fraud cases really have been attempts to mask the returns of a company
5839417 it is a court that is very mistrustful of lawyer driven litigation
5839418 counsel finding soft spots in the system rather than clearly injured persons bringing actions against companies that do wrong
5839419 if not in stoneridge at least in enron there were real injured parties and real wrongdoing
5839420 the question is how far the liability is going to extend
5839421 so long as they do not publicly announce their involvement
5839422 theres a question of real principle here which decisions should be made by the courts and which should be made by congress
5839423 who still runs individual files and relies on the file association handlers to open them
5839424 couldnt the user just use a library or allow the program in question to read the compressed data from all compressed archives in a given directory and find the music files itself
5839425 because defenses respected the run rutgers was able to pass
5839426 the truth is i liked anchoring shows and also got tired of anchoring shows
5839427 i believe our competition at msnbc made a decision on how to program their network which is different than how we program our network
5839428 we have not had to pay with the marketing partnership
5839429 we have attempted from the department of tourism perspective to provide incentives to help as opposed to paying for empty seats
5839430 another iconic hotel overlooking central park will be preserved and its unionized workforce protected this is excellent news for new yorks tourism and hospitality industries
5839431 the price of oil is going only one way up for the next five years because it is going to take at least that long for alternatives to kick in

5839448 well actually we are going to go on all platforms but we will come out on pc first we will even come out on cellphones and stuff one of the things in the game is that as you go around and encounter things creatures and plants or whatever you make trading cards of each thing that is the metaphor for the database trading cards so you can collect your cards you can print them out you can now play your own card game that might be like the cell phone part that stuff is so light its more about collectibility as opposed to interaction every creature in the pc game is three or four megabytes but the cards that is the database that the player is building

5839458 ive noticed studying overseas that most countries do not have the same idea of racism that we do in america we have been trained by political correctness to view stereotypes or the calling of attention to ethnic features as inherently racist but in much of the world these are not necessarily seen as such

5839503 dear mishpochah family like many of you i was saddened by the news that todd bentley and his wife shonnah have recently separated todd was a point man for a major move of gods spirit we should pray for todd and shonnah and believe god for their restoration this does not diminish the great victories that were won through the lakeland revival also called the florida outpouring including the multitudes who were saved and healed it was a genuine move of gods spirit personally my faith has developed dramatically and the miracles have increased in my ministry as a result of participating in several of the revival meetings for now until we have more complete information we have decided to remove todds interviews from our tv and radio archives please join me in praying for todd and shonnah as well as the entire staff of fresh fire ministries shalom and love sid israel roth
5839504 for now until we have more complete information we have decided to remove todds interviews from our tv and radio archives
5839505 personally my faith has developed dramatically and the miracles have increased in my ministry as a result of participating in several of the revival meetings
5839506 overall a solid set of maiden results from fresnillo which we would expect to be reflected in positive share price performance
5839507 if the commodities continue to come down we believe we will benefit from those lower prices and hence translating into lower production costs
5839508 we are consumers of commodities such as steel for many purposes we are also consumers of explosives which are a derivative of oil
5839509 to date we have had several hundred inquiries from parties interested in the dawnay day uk property portfolio and we have spent some time going through these expressions of interest
5839510 any interested party who has not been in touch should now do so immediately as we will be seeking to draw up a shortlist of purchasers in the very near future
5839511 after a robust q1 trading deteriorated significantly in may and june
5839512 with this difficult period for the company drawing to an end it can now progress its gold project development has been pushed back by at least a year but the company has been working on a new processing opportunity which may benefit capital and operating costs of the project
5839513 this should be reassuring and we believe the stock is undervalued
5839514 although the company does have significant debt around 400 million pounds following acquisitions we do not expect the company to breach its debt covenants over the medium term partly because of the companys model
5839515 some cheery words but ultimately reads like the prelude to a warning
5839516 the woolworths board is not unwilling to talk to baugur but was unwilling to recommend the bid it made

5839521 the major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair
5839522 a common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools

5839540 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
5839541 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
5839542 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
5839543 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled
5839544 even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with the defendants religious beliefs
5839545 the origin was in germany at the turn of the 20th century
5839546 in america workers comp took root later in the 20th century
5839547 from the start it was designed to cover most non agricultural employment where there is a valid employer employee relationship
5839548 this insulates companies from the massive awards a plaintiff can win in other kinds of court
5839549 from the outset of the workers comp system an exclusive remedy rule has applied which severely limits the right of the employee to sue an employer for negligence
5839550 the injured worker has all of their medical expenses covered without deductions or co pays
5839551 doctor bills hospital bills prescription drug bills all of that is supposed to be covered
5839552 after a waiting period which varies by state and is never over seven days
5839553 workers comp covers all the medicals and indemnity expenses for the lifetime of the claim
5839554 there are rules in each state defining limits to benefits for injuries not deemed permanent in virtually all states the injured worker and their insurer can agree to settle a claim leaving the insurer without any further open obligation in some states many if not most permanent cases are settled
5839555 what are often not covered or covered but with often complicated exclusions are mental claims and disease claims such as cancers from exposure to toxins
5839556 generally these are not covered but court decisions have addressed these issues in virtually all states and these decisions rather than the language of the law tend to govern
5839557 the most common ground for rejecting claims which can only be done by the insurer is that the injury was not caused by work
5839558 a proficient adjuster should be able to make that determination perhaps with the help of a doctor who inspects the worker
5839559 in many states the adjuster can delay making such a decision for months
5839560 and if the adjuster decides then to deny the claim the already paid benefits to the worker are not returned
5839561 under workers comp law a person is not entitled to get benefits unless they are an employee
5839562 im not arguing about medical issues im not arguing about doctors im arguing that this person is not an employee
5839563 and the rules set largely by court decisions vary by states
5839564 typically an independent contractor is being paid to complete a job to complete a task and is not being paid by the hour
5839565 if i hire a painter to paint my house im not supervising that persons every brush stroke
5839566 injuries by undocumented workers are usually covered by workers compensation
5839567 the concierge desk the porters the superintendents the maintenance people are all typically employees of the building
5839568 a lot of employees come up with phony claims a lot of doctors support the phony claims some employers take advantage and dont report everyone trying to save premiums and fees
5839569 the book is basically a leftist handbook meant to tell the proper opinion on every issue
5839570 as a way not only of reading but also of proselytizing and subverting the mind numbing consumer capitalist fascist sexist racist classist ideologies that surrounded us in the form of american mythologies and mass culture

5839583 the seller was very pleased to have sold over 7 6 million dollars of inventory in ninety minutes
5839584 the rapid sale of this project is a clear indication of the high demand for moderately priced housing alternatives in the bay area and also of the interest auctions are generating in the current market
5839585 i would like to thank longgen for his dedicated service to xinyuan

5839589 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver
5839590 we were extremely pleased by the participation of the local companies private security and others
5839591 while we hope to never have to face such a situation scenario based training involving first responders and others impacted by a potential attack helps strengthen response and relationships that can only improve performance under real circumstances
5839592 this training exercise provided valuable information regarding readily available specialized equipment and coordination with emergency responders
5839593 after the training universal protection service approached the san francisco fire department regarding additional and expanded wmd training we started working closely with sffd back in july 2007 to coordinate and roll out the multi agency training it was extremely exciting to see all of it come together and take place
5839594 universal protection service plans to disseminate the training results and lessons learned to all of its other buildings in the area and conduct table top training sessions with their security teams
5839595 villas at west road is a well located high quality community in a strong houston submarket
5839596 it is our final acquisition in our second fund which now owns five high quality communities in the southeast and southwest we continue to favor apartments the current climate in which there is less financing and less equity capital for acquisitions provides an opportunity for us to grow our apartment portfolio and we plan to continue to take advantage of this climate
5839597 we like houston and we are very bullish on the sam houston tollway west road location of the villas at west road which is walking distance from neighborhood shopping there are also a number of things that we find appealing in the community for houston it has very low density at 12 units to the acre all of the apartment homes are two story and have private first floor entrances and 70 of the apartments have attached garages the community has a great feel and is a very desirable place to live
5839598 it is a property that can maintain high occupancy lower turnover and consistently outperform the market
5839599 if a person who has had a stroke can walk across a room i should be able to run 20 miles

5839610 more than 20 dollars clearly shows that there has been speculation in the market
5839611 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5839612 the price must be maintained at a level close to us100 because the costs have increased
5839613 the market is reacting to reports that opec may cut production
5839614 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5839615 oil has lost its bullish mojo and it may take a major event or a great technical stand to go get its groove back

5839652 it is clear from the enthusiastic demonstrations we see on tv that the georgians are very supportive of their president and what he has said and done

5839656 my interest in this conflict is more a spinoff of our presidential election than any personal involvement im just an ordinary american trying to make sense of a lot of confusing information trying to decide which of two candidates for president will better serve the cause of effective conflict resolution in foreign policy
5839657 most americans are ignorant about these matters and show no interest in learning popular entertainment sadly gets more attention from the us electorate than foreign policy nevertheless a few of us are trying to do the responsible thing by putting a man into office who appears to be more open to creative conflict resolution than others in recent years
5839658 the larger picture to me indicates simmering tensions and political ferment in many parts of the world formerly held in place by heavy handed autocratic regimes

5839660 i read your glowing description of baku awash with oil wealth and looking for all the world like the next dubai or whatever in a way i can almost hear the same expectations for tblisi in the background and thats good thats evidence of positive thinking and hope for the future even in the darkest days of saddams ugly tyranny the people of kurdistan were making the best of a bad situation from what i have read and building a social and economic model that would be comfortable for most world travelers it helped of course that the peshmergas are among the worlds best warriors but their role in the picture is probably less important than the role of we have to say it oil

5839680 there was one par 5 today where he hit wedge in for his second and i was cranking a 3 wood
5839681 im not sure where it came from said lee who didnt touch a golf club until late in 2000 but was hooked the second he did
5839682 boom boom on lee when he was in the midst of winning the new zealand stroke play championship the new south wales match play and stroke play titles as well as the prestigious western amateur where he began the final round five strokes down and won by five after firing a 61

5839686 i really do believe he can win major championships but i dont want to put too much pressure on him hes a bright kid who has a lot of confidence in his own ability hes got a heck of a game there are traits of tiger there he gets frustrated but he gets on with the game

5839877 at some point and time we just have to figure out what the heck it is obviously its not what i want but at this juncture its something that needs to happen obviously theres something going on
5839878 i just have some numbness in fingers that obviously im not used to having as far as pain goes theres not very much pain at all with it its just like i said you have to figure out what it is or it gets so bad to where it gets to be a really bad problem
5839879 its something that weve dealt with like i said ive never had to deal with it on that level its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered like this until now
5839880 if we win the grey cup ill probably have 1 000 1 000
5839881 thats what matters to me winning every game if we win every game and i get that then so be it if we win grey cup and i dont get it then again so be it
5839882 the fact is he can protect he can make good plays with his legs and then he can come out of the backfield and make some awesome plays with his hands
5839883 hes an all around back that takes our offence to another level

5839887 but i want it the football any way i can get it
5839888 its tough its really tough because we have so many different routes that he runs and they dont know what hes going to do
5839889 were going to look for the matchups and take advantage of them when we can
5839890 the bye comes at a great time because we need the rest
5839891 if youre not banged as a football player then youre not working hard and i feel we are working hard and need the rest right now
5839892 the weirdest part was when my father called me dad
5839893 then it hit me that i really was a father
5839894 the children have kept me going after i do playboy we want to try ivf its asking a lot but if its possible it would make our package complete
5839895 it was my first nude scene and it wasnt supposed to be me
5839896 i had a body double and we had some complicating factors with her it was sort of a last minute thing where i said ill just go ahead and do this
5839897 i was really uncomfortable this crew that id been working with that knows me when i put on my producer hat suddenly sees me naked it was really humiliating
5839898 im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
5839899 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
5839900 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt
5839901 this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform i would ask that my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance
5839902 ive been dying to get tattoos of hall oates forever i was like im doing it my hands were swollen and puffy for like two days
5839903 itll be weird to say hey dude i have a tattoo of your face on my hand but everyone knows im a die hard fan
5839904 it is private property if people were cool this would not be an issue
5839905 this is an outrage its a real slap in the face to all the communities who use it
5839906 there was a strip club on bourbon street there was one they advertise as live sex shows and i went in there and met a male stripper who said he was straight and that he serviced men and women he was the guy i hung out with most
5839907 on one occasion a guy came in and said to my friend hey man i need you for a job right now
5839908 i dont regret not going to college if i had gone to college i would never have seen the world i dont know that if i would have went to college id have ended up walking out with a degree so its probably better that i didnt try
5839909 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great i so wish i had listened to my mom and grandma when i was 18 and would complain about some little tiny bump or feeling bloated i used to scoff and say no i feel fat today now the jokes on me
5839910 i want to tell all young girls to walk around in bikinis all summer because there will be that one day in your twenties when youll eat a hamburger and actually see the hamburger on the side of your leg

5839917 no likelihood of success on the merits of its claim under the federal computer intrusion law and denied the transit agencys request for a five month injunction
5839918 the judge today correctly found that it was unlikely that the cfaa would apply to security researchers giving an academic talk
5839919 a presentation at a security conference is not some sort of computer intrusion its protected speech and vital to the free flow of information about computer security vulnerabilities silencing researchers does not improve security the vulnerability was there before the students discovered it and would remain in place regardless of whether the students publicly discussed it or not
5839920 the only thing keeping the students and the mbta from working together cooperatively to resolve the fare payment card security issues is the lawsuit itself
5839921 the mbta would be far better off focusing on improving the mbtas fare payment security instead of pursuing needless litigation
5839922 im trying to find out the details from my hp rep ill withhold judgment until i see the numbers

5839924 we are a premier support partner for dell and when we have a problem we dont have to call india

5839940 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
5839941 government is at a stand little better practiced now than three or four thousand years ago
5839942 our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington d c but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we the people want
5839943 and what we want by and large is this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods we want to be able to pump gas into our cars regardless of how big they may happen to be and we want to be able to do these things without having to think about whether or not the books are balanced at the end of the month or the end of the fiscal year
5839944 one of the ways we avoid confronting our refusal to balance the books is to rely increasingly on the projection of american military power around the world to try to maintain this dysfunctional system or set of arrangements that have evolved over the last 30 or 40 years
5839945 i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat compromised our freedom of action how every president from richard nixon down declared were going to fix the problem but none of them did
5839946 the clearest statement of what i value is found in the preamble to the constitution there is nothing in the preamble to the constitution which defines the purpose of the united states of america as remaking the world in our image which i view as a fools errand
5839947 i believe that the framers of the constitution were primarily concerned with focusing on the way we live here the way we order our affairs
5839948 and that future generations would also be able to share in those same opportunities with the current crisis in american foreign policy unless we do change our ways the likelihood that our children our grandchildren the next generation is going to enjoy the opportunities that weve had is very slight because were squandering our power we are squandering our wealth
5839949 the congress especially with regard to matters related to national security policy has thrust power and authority to the executive branch we have created an imperial presidency the congress no longer is able to articulate a vision of what is the common good the congress exists primarily to ensure the reelection of members of congress
5839950 has made our democracy a false one were going through the motions of a democratic political system but the fabric of democracy i think really has worn very thin
5839951 was a fundamental mistake it never should have been undertaken and were never going to do this kind of thing again
5839952 be the moment when we look ourselves in the mirror and see what we have become and perhaps undertake an effort to make those changes in the american way of life that will enable us to preserve for future generations that which we value most about the american way of life

5839957 there is a simple message to those individuals like thompson who think they can go to this website or any space on the internet and discuss their sexual interest in children and share images
5839958 you leave a digital footprint and we will track you down and hold you to account
5839959 he was essentially the librarian for a myriad of images that were distributed to like minded individuals in this country and elsewhere
5839960 i hope this result acts as a deterrent and sends out a clear warning that activity such as this will not be tolerated
5839961 what is heartening on that question is that both candidates republican and democrat have indicated that they will be moving on this and with an ambitious set of targets
5839962 if post election the us joins the kyoto system its involvement would take away the excuses for inaction from developing countries like china and india
5839963 sovereign actions that in itself would be an incredibly good thing

5839965 it was a good performance against orazgaliyev in the pre quarters in the first period i did not attack enough and still scored enough to take an upper hand but i could not repeat it when i needed it most i got a decent draw and it was disappointing to lose against yumoto
5839966 this was a bout which we should have won he yogeshwar got an easy draw but unfortunately could not make the most of it a win here would have put him in the medal contention but that was not to be

5839979 she could have easily just stuck her middle finger up at us i mean it would have been the same thing
5839980 im not going to come out and say who that is but it seems pretty clear that we need to vote for the one that is interested in building up our defenses and willing to go to war when it is appropriate to do so instead of the one that would rather engage in pointless international discussions with our enemies

5839992 starting with diefenbaker trudeau and all of us we established very good relations relatively speaking with china and suddenly you break the bridge it would have been easy just to be there
5839993 we want to capitalize on the attention to this issue and get students talking about this because it directly impacts their lives
