8170021 barack and michelle listened and they understood it was like talking with family it became clear that they are regular people
8170022 just bringing people together so real changes can be made that affect the everyday lives of people like me
8170023 joe from next door cannot end life on the earth
8170024 the power and the story how the crafted presidential narrative has determined political success from george washington to george w bush
8170025 you start out with almost an anti intellectual strain there i want someone whos like me so they can understand me and know what i need government to be doing
8170026 to have a bad bowling score is good people see you as human
8170027 no matter how educated you are how successful you are you still need to be just folks
8170028 you want someone who you can say hes like me but i know in a crisis situation he can handle it
8170029 we can no longer be looked at as this couch potato what about me
8170030 if we hadnt been here we wouldnt have made those connections
8170031 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8170032 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8170033 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8170034 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8170035 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8170036 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8170037 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8170038 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8170039 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8170040 its important that people of faith are being listened to just like other constituencies that were not marginalized
8170041 just because were participating in the process and engaging people who may not agree with us doesnt mean were just a mascot
8170042 lets be honest religion has been used and abused by politics
8170043 a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
8170044 reaching out to us and im not naive as to why they want our votes
8170045 but they wont get them and keep them unless they continue the momentum of adopting policies that promote the sanctity of life
8170046 id like to see obama address that say that voice is no longer welcome
8170047 i certainly didnt feel used obviously politics is politics i dont want to be naive i also dont want to be cynical
8170048 the majority of our party people they are people of faith
8170049 when we get elected we dont check our faith at the door we may not wear it on our sleeve
8170050 by the end of summer it gives me a 4 foot wall of plants and i can step out of my kitchen and grab a tomato
8170051 weve actually met and talked to more of our neighbors in the last four months than we have in the eight years weve been here
8170052 a little bit of a tourist spot on the trip to the bike path at the end of our street
8170053 first people had questions now they have encouragement occasionally they even bring plants for us
8170054 we dont need to limit ourselves on what our gardens contain
8170055 should we ever need to depend on it we have a lot of greens
8170056 some of the hard to grow junipers that might not be as pretty and as productive as some of the edible plants people are pulling those out and planting blueberries and blackberries and strawberries
8170057 so theyre really great low maintenance opportunities to grow big beautiful fruits in your garden

8170060 technology is playing an important role in this convention moreso than ever before
8170061 first of all the delaware delegation was moved from the back of the floor to the front when joe biden was tapped as obamas running mate its a great view
8170062 what made me get into blogging was wanting to have a voice in politics
8170063 im not blogging from my mothers basement in my sweat pants eating cheetos
8170064 should fire the head of the national police agency to show his sincerity
8170065 together we can form joint companies with pdvsa and that way we can continue providing our experience and knowledge of the business
8170066 i always hated japan and ive come to hate it more these days
8170067 i explode with anger whenever they say its their territory
8170068 japans past wrongdoing and its colonial rule are condensed in these tiny islets
8170069 japan is of the view that both sides should respond calmly to this issue recognizing the differences in positions between our countries as differences in positions
8170070 oh we have wheat fields that are at least twice as large
8170071 we have longhorns that are at least twice as large as your cows
8170072 notwithstanding recent reductions in forecast short termglobal economic growth prospects the broad environment in whichthe group operates remains underpinned by long term factors anddemand for our services continues to be very strong
8170073 we expect to see significant investment in new andreplacement production capacity by our customers particularlyin our core markets
8170074 investors have already been finding it difficult to pushshort and mid term yields lower for some time because the boj isnot seen as lowering rates
8170075 despite the well reported difficulties in the economies ofa number of international markets trading is ahead of where weexpected it to be at the half year
8170076 overall we have delivered an excellent performance for thefirst half of 2008 and we are very confident for the remainderof the year
8170077 la soci t frank est une entreprise remarquable avec des relations commerciales historiques
8170078 we expect wpi inflation to increase to 12 82 per cent year on year from 12 63 per cent in the previous week due to higher prices of food articles rubber sugar paper products oilseeds textiles rubber and plastic products
8170079 two indicators show that demand as of now is strong non food credit and manufactured product prices
8170080 financials have been under a little bit of pressure istill think the oil price is one of the fundamentals the marketis watching at the moment in terms of its effect on inflationand sentiment
8170081 i dont have any definite answers but it is a great opportunity to promote olympic sports
8170082 we won three medals in beijing but that also gives us a lot of responsibility to keep this momentum going
8170083 weve to give our athletes the best opportunity to perform well at london 2012
8170084 we need to have a goal how we want to do going ahead if we are to replicate our performance
8170085 they say a man is never satisfied and im not
8170086 next time i will try to get a gold medal in london
8170087 my priority will be boxing but if i get time i will also do some modelling
8170088 our strategic move into continental europe has deliveredthe expected benefits of diversifying the risk profile of ourportfolio and given us the flexibility to target our investmentsin the locations where we can achieve the best returns
8170089 we are satisfied with this profit development super deboer is moving in the right direction and we are maintainingthe course we have set
8170090 the population of the united states is almost a bulls eye for rolla
8170091 actually the last time i heard it was a steel mill about nineteen or twenty miles southeast of us
8170092 well ive heard him speak i follow politics on tv and in print and everything i do the best i can to keep up with it and from everything ive seen of course im a little prejudiced because im a democrat and he got the democratic nomination and hes the one im supporting joe biden i like him because he says what he means if he gets upset with something i mean he gets with it but he didnt get traction so now with biden as vice president i got both of what i wanted
8170093 we just kind of thought if we had rednecks for carnahan well wed have rednecks for obama
8170094 ive seen so many people coming by here going look at that and weve had a lot of camera action
8170095 ive had people step out here and ask me what entitles me to call myself a redneck
8170096 shoot im from the country i was raised without running water in the house till i was out of high school i went to a one room schoolhouse ive raised hogs ive raised cattle ive raised chickens i hunt i fish i own guns i own a boat a four wheel drive and i like nascar if that dont qualify me to be a damn redneck i dont know what the hell does
8170097 yeah thats the message were trying to send out dont be afraid to vote for obama
8170098 i dont know some people just dont like change and weve never had a president that was the skin color he is but that dont cut no ice with me i dont care if youre black green or yellow if youre qualified for the job and he certainly is
8170099 maybe people will think if these rednecks are from rolla maybe it aint so bad being for obama

8170101 i shall not be bringing in anyone today or tomorrow so for now everyone should be concentrating on the job in hand and that is making sure that liverpool reach the group stages
8170102 the team have forgotten the match in liege it was just a bad day and we are thinking about qualifying at anfield
8170103 nobody in the squad is thinking about anything other than qualifying i am always optimistic and i am convinced we will beat standard
8170104 but there are no easy games in europe and we are aware that this match is not decided
8170105 if we improve and play at our real level it will be very difficult for them
8170106 liege are probably the hardest opponents we have faced in champions league qualifiers but we know we are better than them even though they played well in the first leg
8170107 at anfield we are confident we can win and i expect us to win the key is to be calm and confident in your team and the ability of your players we have the players who can win this type of game
8170108 whatever happens it will not really disrupt my transfer plans we are so close to the end of the window things will not change liverpool not qualifying money is really important but that is always the situation in football
8170109 i check gamesindustry biz every day you have to to know whats going on its definitely the best european news site and is beginning to offer a more global view too theres a ton of information and news on the net but this is the one that matters
8170110 advertising trends have continued to deteriorate over the course of the year and future performance will inevitably be linked to the economies of the uk and to a lesser extent that of the republic of ireland

8170115 i dont want to fight i dont want to shout
8170116 i wish i could play normal matches and enjoy tennis
8170117 it showed you that you always play the game out
8170118 i clearly had the advantage because he couldnt walk me and he really couldnt risk it and throw me a slider
8170119 so i pretty much knew i was going to get fastballs to hit it certainly wasnt an easy situation but it was as easy a situation as a batter could be in as long as you recognize that and know that hes got to come with a fastball ultimately he did
8170120 you forget that you get paid to play the game it was almost like we felt like little kids
8170121 had a good spring practice and a really good preseason
8170122 so were going to go with clark and start him but i dont want him looking over his shoulder
8170123 theres a psychological element that goes into playing quarterback joes not saying ive tattooed this position on your back but a quarterback has to know that hes going to have some ups and downs and still have our confidence
8170124 i told clark and ill tell him again before he goes on the field and when we meet on friday hey just go in there and enjoy it
8170125 clark smiles i said to the other two kids you guys ok with that yeah lets go win that was it
8170126 pats a competitor and im sure hes looking at it that its not done yet
8170127 both of them can run the same offense but their strengths are different
8170128 pats been the guy more comfortable in the pocket and darylls more of a get him out of the pocket and let him make plays guy
8170129 i know people are going to say we picked daryll because hes the older guy
8170130 number one if we did that we would have picked paul a graduate student so that debunks that and number two thats not being fair to daryll
8170131 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8170132 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8170133 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8170134 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8170135 there are a lot of reasons for it but ill talk about it at the end of the season
8170136 weve chatted with him but we thought it was most appropriate to kind of wait until the end of the season to move forward on anything
8170137 but he has expressed that he is pitching next year and beyond probably
8170138 but wed be crazy not to think that hed be able to help us next year but again that doesnt mean hes going to be back
8170139 superstitions there are stup erstitions stupid stuff you do that you think works that stuff doesnt work wear the same underwear make sure one is marked game and the other is marked bp make sure the socks are the same way all that stuff its crazy there are only 24 hours in a day
8170140 we hope to have a deal to mlb by the end of the year
8170141 do you realize how much we give up so that you can
8170142 i saw him throw his finger toward the showers and i thought what are you talking about
8170143 youre going to throw me out and the games already over youre cool
8170144 somebody to get close enough to where i could touch them

8170150 i joked around with coach that i really dont like to run the ball but in this offense im trying to adapt things pop open so i guess im kind of enjoying becoming a runner although i get yelled at every once in a while when i pitch the ball to the running back
8170151 ive seen no swelling in his knee he hasnt been hit yet but hes looked real good
8170152 i feel like i should be ready for anything else
8170153 we kind of like to work the field all over
8170154 i sat out spring ball and got to watch and get the feel of things from the sidelines
8170155 so im pretty excited about this season and the team that we have we have a really good defense that is going to carry us through a couple of games our offense will start coming along and with our defenses help well be in a position to win a lot of games
8170156 i know its difficult to implement in the middle of a season but the games are important in september i hope it works well
8170157 we play all year long and were trying to get somewhere and all we need is for somebody to miss a call like that
8170158 we had a chance to win the wild card that blown call helped bury us its a tough way to get eliminated but at the same time some calls have gone our way
8170159 its all about getting the call right thats what everyone wants
8170160 i love the game and im glad weve got him because i wouldnt want him on any other team i know hes going to give us a great opportunity to win games hes a special athlete and a great athlete
8170161 i cant rush back if i rush it that might be my whole season dealing with the hamstring injury week in and week out i dont want that
8170162 its getting better every day so i think if it continues to progress like it is now i should be ready for the first game
8170163 its not good that it happened but luckily it happened in the preseason where i have an opportunity to rehab and get strong and not feel like i have to play on a bum leg
8170164 the inside receiver is against a lot of safeties and the linebackers who come down here and try to guard you to me that is a mismatch im a lot faster just get the ball in my hands and i can make things happen i know theyre going to try to get in my face and jam me on the line of scrimmage ive been working real hard on that
8170165 hopefully when i come back theyll still want to give me the ball
8170166 the season hasnt started yet its still preseason and preseason is preseason it really doesnt count for anything
8170167 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8170168 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8170169 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8170170 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8170171 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8170172 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8170173 i had the chance to vote against mccain and prevent all this from happening but my feelings were hurt and i decided my feelings were more important than your future
8170174 hes been around forever hes not even in the area now hes an assistant at lycoming but we talk every couple of days
8170175 weve had our couple of injuries here too thats all part of the game
8170176 we just have to get him healthy and get him out there
8170177 ive had a chance to look at him on film
8170178 i think hes playing well it doesnt look like he is any different than he was last year he is making great throws

8170181 but i have my own system i get some hot tea and cold water
8170182 if you get a little tired you splash some on your face
8170183 you always have the challenge as a coach to make sure they dont get bored
8170184 a lot of times ill put new packages in just because of that but sometimes you have to give them a break during the meetings
8170185 yeah weve seen a few guys go to sleep especially the rookies
8170186 a lot of times rookies myself included think well be done by noon and have the rest of the day to hang out but its like a regular day at work youll see a coach call out a guy when hes sleeping hey you see this you see this guy and theyre still knocked out
8170187 i try to bring a little juice and creativity to the presentation
8170188 we dont have many problems at all except sometimes with a veteran who has heard that particular play for the 300th time
8170189 hell tell us to stand up but he pretty much understands he knows the meetings get long and its hard to stay awake hell joke about it sometimes
8170190 a lot of it is on his shoulders for wednesday on how the offense goes
8170191 i have the same mind set as the coaches going into the wednesday morning meeting
8170192 as were in the meeting ill highlight different things i think we should emphasize the main purpose of the meeting is for the offensive line and running backs to find out what running plays we want to attack them with and for the receivers to find out what depth they should run their routes and how the defense may play them im looking at how the cornerbacks play and trying to figure out their weaknesses and strengths
8170193 i usually go through the personnel of the opponent coming up and some of the key things we have to stop
8170194 then we talk about the game plan and i show them a little bit of film of the opponent its definitely one of the most important days
8170195 we have 16 to 20 plays in the walk through
8170196 those are all the new plays shifts formations and motions anything that is new
8170197 if your quarterback doesnt feel good about it you get rid of the play
8170198 you get 150 plays in your game plan and youre going to run 60 of those if our quarterback doesnt feel good about it its gone
8170199 they do a good job of reminding us of that
8170200 there have been times when we had a big win and we come back on wednesday and were looking like crap theyll let us know we might go with pads the next day just to send us a message
8170201 sometimes you have to have patience at the wednesday practice knowing that you put something new in and it might take them a day to learn it
8170202 by friday i want to make sure we have eliminated those mistakes were always putting a new pressure package in every week
8170203 thats the time for the position coaches to get with their players watch some film and get an idea of the guy theyre going against those meetings usually last about an hour
8170204 after the position meetings we come up and look at practice on film and then we start getting ready for the next days practice
8170205 usually im able to leave around 9 30 or 10 oclock a lot of times its a 16 hour day because you just want to make sure you cover everything

8170283 technology is playing an important role in this convention moreso than ever before
8170284 first of all the delaware delegation was moved from the back of the floor to the front when joe biden was tapped as obamas running mate its a great view
8170285 what made me get into blogging was wanting to have a voice in politics
8170286 they told me to take off my clothes to rape me or they would kill me immediately this moment was the worst moment in my life
8170287 i was watching them taking off their clothes preparing to rape me i did not know what to do so i started shouting loudly please do not do that i will ask my family to give you whatever you want
8170288 the other two kidnappers took off my clothes by force and at that time i saw them as three dirty animals trying to tear my body apart
8170289 i told my family that i was beaten by them but i did not dare to tell my family that i was raped by them i could not say it its too much shame
8170290 armed islamic groups and militias have been known to be particularly hostile toward homosexuals frequently and openly engaging in violent campaigns against them
8170291 militias are reportedly threatening families of men believed to be homosexual stating that they will begin killing family members unless the men are handed over or killed by the family
8170292 gay men and lesbians in iraq face a lot of risks right now because homosexuality is sometimes interpreted by people in iraq as being a western import
8170293 so they can sometimes be targeted by insurgent groups or militias in part because of animosity toward the west and in part because homosexuality is not well accepted in iraqi society
8170294 the biggest threats right now are from militia organizations who will attack and actually sometimes kill gay men and women
8170295 i would rather commit suicide than allow my family to find out i am gay
8170296 i am also careful with the way i dress not to show them that i am gay especially my family
8170297 they will force me to give it up and i cannot do that
8170298 the normal people cannot live in iraq imagine how the life is for gays
8170299 i do not know why people hate gays even though so many have this tendency but still they hate it
8170300 illegal under islamic law and gays should be punished by law like criminals
8170301 one day he told me he would come over to my house and kill me in front of my family
8170302 i told him i would come outside and be killed in the street because i do not want my family to find out i am gay
8170303 during my sleep i only see nightmares and i start crying my family thought it was because they were beating me

8170359 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8170360 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche

8170364 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8170395 fixed income is a relatively opaque asset class compared to standard exchange traded equities and consequently it has historically always been harder to obtain detailed daily performance attribution analysis on fixed income holdings
8170396 our new tool is the next generation in fixed income attribution analysis and is completely customisable to meet the requirements of each asset manager client depending on its individual investment process for fixed income
8170397 increasingly the trend is for asset managers to provide more performance data to institutional investors and importantly to be able to explain where performance is coming from and where it isnt at the same time asset owners are demanding increased transparency around their investments our enhanced fixed income analytics tool is the latest in a series of strategic developments to provide specialist performance and risk analytics solutions to asset managers and asset owners

8170495 while the martu people have not yet had the opportunity to properly consider uranium mining on their lands we are not opposed to it in principle
8170496 we strongly believe that uranium mining could be an opportunity for our people to generate equity and commercial benefit and importantly play an important part in the development of significant resources projects for this state
8170497 this is an important intergenerational issue for our people and its an issue that martu should be able to consider and make decisions about in an informed manner
8170498 it is especially a means of achieving economic and social outcomes for a group of people who continue to be under serviced by the state government
8170499 we have also been making representations to minister jim mcginty the minister for health in relation to martu health issues and he has not even replied to our requests for a meeting

8170502 the united states government has no business meddling with internal conflicts in the country with their interference it has become clear that they are taking undue advantage of the conflict in mindanao and the bangsamoro peoples struggle in order to put forward their geopolitical interests in the region
8170503 the ongoing conflict and negotiations are working to the advantage of the united states it has become a convenient excuse for the united states military to prolong their stay in the war torn region facilitating virtual permanence of foreign military bases despite constitutional provisions against it moreover the prolonged stay of us military forces in mindanao has resulted to unresolved cases of human rights violations their presence and the conduct of military exercises in the region have been widely opposed the united states should stop meddling in mindanao affairs

8170522 it is great to be celebrating his birthday to go to the same school and to have played cricket on this oval so many times it is just amazing to be living in the same place as he lived
8170523 i have always dreamed of being a great cricketer like him
8170524 we would have many discussions about various players he was a person who very much knew his own mind you had to have a very convincing argument if you wanted to disagree with him he did not suffer fools gladly
8170525 you rarely if ever heard him talk about his performances but he was always praising the performances of others
8170526 he dedicated his entire life to improving the game he was very determined that players were conscious of the need of spectators he wanted them to play bright attractive cricket and he impressed that on them
8170527 he was not only one of the greatest players but one of the games greatest administrators he fought to make the game fairer for everybody
8170528 he represented all that was best about how to live ones life
8170529 the fact that he could stride the world stage at cricket and yet remain essentially true to himself and the values of dignity integrity and modesty that he learnt here in bowral
8170530 he didnt think those values conflicted with courage determination competitiveness and ambition in fact they complimented one another that is his legacy
8170531 damn sure it has got something to do with the actual burning of the dvd files

8170614 hes a tough hard nosed football player everything a team could want in its locker room
8170615 hes consistent not up one game and down the next he studies the game he watches a lot of film i think hed be a good coach someday
8170616 we have a lot of talent especially up front some guys who probably wont get recognition on a larger scale like aubrayo franklin and ray mcdonald those guys come off the ball and they play hard theres so much potential on this team
8170617 everybody talks to each other and says dont tip off your stance here or we expect you to make that play its constructive criticism
8170618 one of the best technicians as a young linebacker that ive seen hes never out of position to make a play some guys may be all over the place where they take false steps hes not going to give you the false steps he understands what he has to do with his steps before the ball is even snapped that has to do with formation recognition

8170624 we started zeroing in on players being successful not just on the course but in the broader sports entertainment marketplace
8170625 to do that they have to communicate effectively this is an important thing for the players and for the lpga tour to succeed its important for the future

8170647 he takes 1 000 grounders hits early every day and tries to beat the crap out of you
8170648 i felt like we had a good corps of young guys here
8170649 we were just getting started there were good people here i wanted to stay here as long as i could
8170650 its bothered me but i know theyre looking out for me and my best interests
8170651 i feel like i need the reps and the drills to make myself as good as possible so i always try to get in as much as possible
8170652 if i had my choice id still be playing gunner too anything theyll let me do im going to do it
8170653 obviously he was very disappointed during the first meeting i had with him but there is no other person who is more dedicated to the teams success
8170654 even though hes not out there in the huddle hes coaching guys
8170655 its just really impressive to see a guy refusing to go into the tank and feeling sorry for himself
8170656 im going over here to try to make myself a better racecar driver
8170657 i wanted to be more competitive and i wanted to have some more opportunities to win races and things like that
8170658 in anaheim i had bruises from balls everywhere on my shoulder
8170659 but i never got them in the tips this has been the worst year i dont know if im doing something wrong
8170660 it can happen thats very true those are so tough on you having all these kids who are nasty sometimes the hitters are just defending themselves and get the tips
8170661 ive got to do it my season is just starting
8170662 ive got to get down there and get some innings under my belt to show these guys im healthy enough to throw
8170663 were going to look at some things in some certain personnels to utilize him because he catches the ball so well and he is a bigger tailback but dont mistake that
8170664 michael bush isnt here to be a fullback he has a chance to be a spectacular tailback in this league and thats what hes here to play
8170665 were having trouble scoring runs and everybody probably goes up there squeezing the sawdust out of the bats
8170666 i dont think theres any magic formula other than keep going out there and fighting the frustration we seem to be experiencing
8170667 he threw a lot of dang strikes like he always does
8170668 we couldnt get any breaks we hit some balls hard at people but we couldnt get his pitch count up because he was throwing so many strikes
8170669 thats why they got hit hard im making the adjustment getting used to the view
8170670 i put it into third gear coming home because i didnt know if the ball was going to bounce back off the backstop
8170671 it feels better tuesday and ill be back out there today its nothing major
8170672 im chasing everything because i want to get back where i should be
8170673 eine selbstmedikation mit solchen rezeptfreien medikamenten lehnen wir als unverantwortlich ab
8170674 the university has now cleared the most significant legal hurdle
8170675 were one giant step closer to being able to begin construction
8170676 whatever we have to do we will do to maintain the injunction
8170677 if the court takes a year to make a decision the injunction will stay in place for a year
8170678 then another doctor said i needed surgery ive never been injured like that it was one of the most frustrating things ive ever gone through
8170679 but they got big turnovers when they needed them and they never seemed to make the big turnover
8170680 if they say let him beat us with the pass hell beat you
8170681 once you put him in there you tip the scale
8170682 amanam is the best player this league has seen since st francis william taufoou now at cal
8170683 in my opinion no player on a league championship team has been more dominant than this kid
8170684 in the games we played and the games i saw them play he was the most impactful player on both sides of the ball in fact i feel in some of the games that bellarmine won if he wasnt on the field i think they could have lost by multiple scores that is how good i think he is he is a seriously underrated free safety he is around the ball making game saving tackles all of the time

8170687 we now have of pune goa nashik nagpur and hyderabad wherein development work is expected to commence shortly and the projects will be completed over a span of 3 to 5 years
8170688 it took me 23 years to get to brisbane and as soon as i get here im fuckin sick
8170689 i cant hear a fuckin word youre saying mate but nice one

8170691 were in a streak of a lot of games on consecutive days maybe the guys are dragging a little bit im sure well bounce back tomorrow weve got timmy going hopefully well swing the bats
8170692 its a lot easier to get ahead of hitters and get them to chase something i have the confidence to throw strikes in there
8170693 hard work ive got to throw first pitch strikes more often thats what im going to take from this
8170694 they all want to put west nile virus to rest which makes complete sense
8170695 but this process of informing people does not i cant believe it was done so suddenly
8170696 were talking people walking their dogs eating dinner outside this is perfect weather to leave your windows open
8170697 whats going to happen to the elderly couple out for their evening walk and all of a sudden this low flying plane is dropping a mist on them
8170698 days at least before action is taken its not like theyre tipping off the mosquitoes
8170699 our fear is that right now we run a high risk of this jumping into the human population
8170700 is just that a good precaution does it mean that if you stay outdoors youll have an adverse reaction no but to be absolutely certain and put everybody at ease you can simply go indoors
8170701 is meant to stay in the air where the mosquitoes fly
8170702 reduce the risk of any complications to a very small number
8170703 but we havent asked residents to flip their trash cans over

8170705 when the season starts other than the games themselves the intensity during the season is not what it is in august
8170706 so were in the peak month of ligament tears in the nfl
8170707 in the old days guys used training camp to work their way slowly into shape
8170708 these guys today are in shape already but theyre not in football shape its like running a car from 0 to 90 this fast
8170709 well keep doing it until we find the right way
8170710 systemwide we typically adjust our flight schedules based on demand
8170711 these changes will apply to january through march when we see some drop off in travel and traffic
8170712 thats just not the case and because it is such a long distance to travel people are going to look for an alternative airline
8170713 were all hoping another carrier will start nonstop service but still would prefer continental
8170714 but the people in amarillo might because they could see a 30 percent reduction
8170715 that is pretty consistent with which we announced in june which was a 7 9 percent reduction
8170716 im talking specifically about starters who consistently pitch six or seven innings
8170717 it just makes sense to have your best pitchers the ones youre paying the most money working those pressure innings
8170718 mentally youre training pitchers to look over their shoulder for the next guy to bail them out and then you have the 12th or 13th best pitcher on your team coming in for important outs that doesnt make sense
8170719 im not even sure i could pitch today id probably want to be a reliever as a starter you have no chance of controlling your destiny you can have a great game and not be able to finish it i trust me more than i trust a reliever
8170720 we were on a performance count not a pitch count
8170721 dont let them take you out win or lose this is great
8170722 pitchers of the generations up to marichals had a belief that this game is mine the idea of doing permanent harm to a pitchers arm didnt come into anyones mind
8170723 i think its proving over time that they arent really saving anybody guys are getting hurt just as much today as they were before if not more so this whole theory about saving their arms i aint buying it i think kids have to throw more and the more they throw the stronger theyll get in time i think it will go back to what it was for 100 years of baseball
8170724 what organization is going to have the guts to go down to the lower minors and have a four man rotation and forget about counting pitches and let them figure out how to pitch i think a lot of them want to its a combination of agents the money in the game today and fear
8170725 everyone in the locker room feels that even the defensive guys are excited about what were doing on the offensive side of the ball
8170726 i think guys are really understanding the opportunity we have this year as far as making big plays
8170727 you cant be a guy who thinks that the ball isnt coming to you on this play you have to finish every route
8170728 last year it would take a whole half just to get past the 50 yard line
8170729 it is very early but when you compare it to where weve been in the past i like the improvement
8170730 i think weve been through enough with the media and different things
8170731 this coaching staff may not want me to be the quarterback
8170732 the sport has a pace where you have to be very sensitive if this works well and it will work well i think this will help the sport help us get it right in an area that has become increasingly difficult
8170733 i dont plan on giving any home runs up on thursday so it shouldnt really bother me
8170734 as long as we can keep throwing baseballs while theyre doing the reviews that delay wont be a problem but i hope im not the first one who has to do it
8170735 i dont know if its necessary or not but i know its going to be fair to both teams you dont want home runs taken away from you
8170736 if its more than a handful of times ill be surprised its such a tough call in some other ballparks i really think they need help on those calls theres still going to be human error but with our technology theyre going to get it right
8170737 im more old school im a guy who likes the human decision of the umpire right call or wrong call
8170738 a guy might be safe and hes called out and everyone jumps up and down the fans go crazy thats kind of cool
8170739 there are a lot of bad calls you just get through it where will this end and this system isnt going to be perfect either theyre not going to catch everything
8170740 i think its really great every other sport has it why not baseball
8170741 if you have the technology why not use it everyones happier if the call is right
8170742 they can do balls and strikes that would be fine with me
8170743 i dont want to make any predictions that ill be sorry about but there are some people who believe if we handle it right it could actually be efficient in shortening the game a little bit
8170744 we gave them equal opportunities and jake i wouldnt have guessed when we signed wade ended up beating him out
8170745 he came out and took the job he earned it he didnt get it by default
8170746 they didnt know they could count on me to come play
8170747 that didnt surprise me i knew after getting hurt i couldnt come in and mess around this was kind of make or break
8170748 before jake got hurt he was playing well but he wasnt the same jake that we see right now hes much stronger quicker
8170749 once my body felt good that made my mind feel good
8170750 being in the same system two years in a row is huge being able to try to fine tune something rather than try learning which way to go that makes a huge difference too
8170751 2 day course cloud computing managing services that are in the cloud the itil service management way
8170752 there is a lot more to cloud computing than initial thoughts
8170753 i found this an extremely valuable experience to assist my understanding of cloud computing concepts issues and the processes needed to develop successful migration strategies or implement cloud computing solutions
8170754 the 3 most useful things i have learnt on this course were service level management positioning of cloud computing and seeing opportunities for use in our organsation
8170755 lately there is a lot of media exposure on cloud computing on demand computing and virtualization most of the presentations and articles focus on the technical side of it presenting the newest generation of vmware or the way virtualization of servers can be organised but what about the other side of the story how do you manage the continuity of the services that make use of could computing how do you ensure consistency in service levels how do you choose the best provider of your on demand computing services and that doesnt even touch on information security an important side of any it services especially when it uses the cloud for part of the delivery we felt it was an important step to enable us to become a more rounded organisation in terms of it service management solutions expectations on all of us are increasing and this course gives our clients that additional knowledge to show we are a progressive organisation
8170756 with the right training staff will feel more confident satisfied self reliant and actively communicate more effectively introducing and implementing virtualization and cloud computing training programmes will have a ripple effect throughout a company thus improving morale retention efficiency and productivity
8170757 practical education is at the heart of the art of service
8170758 hoy era un campo complicado rol n racheado y con las olas de direcci n distintas al viento el manejo del barco era duro y si el viento aumenta ma ana a 23 24 nudos como dicen puede ser muy espectacular casi ninguno de nosotros hab amos navegado aqu antes y nos vamos aclarando m s estamos intentando mantener el ritmo lo m ximo posible especialmente s hay d as con m s de 20 nudos pues mucha gente tendr problemas y las velas envejecer n r pidamente

8170797 its confirmation that howard countys location business climate and quality of life combines to make it a compelling location for business
8170798 the entire nation is on the precipice of a significant economic downturn and howard county is not immune
8170799 how is it possible that the wealthiest state in the wealthiest nation in the world has a rising poverty rate and such a high poverty rate
8170800 i was astonished to find about 50 people representing a wide range of ages from young mothers to seniors all waiting to apply for some type of benefits
8170801 people are having to make choices about whether to put food on the table or buy gas to go to work
8170802 ich bin mir sicher dass wir weiterkommen werden wir reisen mit gro em selbstvertrauen und hoher motivation nach bukarest
8170803 vor dem hinspiel hatten wir noch kein pflichtspiel absolviert jetzt ist die lage ganz anders das team kennt sich besser
8170804 da hat man gesehen dass wir den weg zum gegnerischen tor kennen wir werden steaua nicht untersch tzen aber wir sind das bessere team
8170805 die leute erwarten nat rlich dass wir weiterkommen aber wir spielen nicht gegen ein mickey maus team
8170806 unsere leistung in l ttich war schlecht aber wir haben kein tor kassiert und das r ckspiel vor eigenem publikum wird ganz anders verlaufen

8170811 get stuck in some series playing a certain type and if theyre doing that two years later they havent had a chance to try different things and if you go from picture to picture youre almost forced to do that
8170812 you had to become very open in your brain in your thinking so there was nothing in your sense of who you are that you objected to im sitting here talking to you and if i saw little slivers of my movies i would remember that i was a hairdresser a boxer a female impersonator a viking a trapeze artist
8170813 i had to mentally psych myself so that when i put on those clothes that wardrobe i believed it and everybody else started to believe it
8170814 there is absolutely nothing to link hari puttar with harry potter
8170815 even if it does rhyme with harry potter surely there is a limit to cases
8170816 however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
8170817 scheduling is very difficult two of them happened to be in venice at the same time because of the burn after reading premiere so there was a brainstorming session
8170818 we sent out a press release one day saying we were on the verge of closing it down and the next day we had 500 000
8170819 they shine the light on the real emergencies and step up where we really need help
8170820 for me the whole goal is to stay relevant as long as i can
8170821 within four weeks i was at level 57 so i almost got to level 60 and then

8170829 sagte trainer fred rutten vor dem entscheidenden qualifikationsspiel heute 20 45 uhr live in der ard bei atletico madrid
8170830 sagte der peruaner der vor zwei wochen im ersten duell eine schultereckgelenksprengung erlitten hatte
8170831 ich will noch mal mit dem trainer sprechen aber eigentlich rechne ich eher in anderthalb wochen gegen dortmund mit meinem comeback
8170832 meinte kevin kuranyi ob der brasilianer gegen atletico allerdings schon wieder zur startelf geh rt ist fraglich weil die abwehr sich in seiner abwesenheit sehr stabil zeigte
8170833 meinte verteidiger christian pander der im hinspiel das einzige tor erzielt hatte
8170834 wir brauchen uns nicht zu verstecken wir wissen dass wir schwer zu schlagen sind

8170842 the people of drummondville can try to claim the title of inventors of poutine we wont sue them
8170843 i wish them good luck i dont want to go to war over poutine
8170844 but you have to do unto caesar what is caesars poutine is a very good dish that was created in warwick in 1957
8170845 its not a symbol everyone is proud of its a dish that isnt elegant or chic and is has zero health content
8170846 but its an icon of junk food cuisine quebecs answer to the hot dog

8170853 make no mistake frank stronach didnt build a reputation over 50 years to all of a sudden have it stained
8170854 in this economic climate and with the way rates have gone up on people in the last few years we take very seriously our responsibility for ensuring there is an appropriate return on ratepayers investment
8170855 by rejecting these cost effective energy conservation programs were putting the consumer of maryland behind the eight ball
8170856 the commission has been presented with no analysis to demonstrate or justify why it is reasonable to spend more than one dollar in administrative and marketing costs to give one dollar in incentives to buyers

8170858 ive had a chance to play and be healthy so im excited to be here
8170859 im motivated to do very well here and for the rest of the season
8170860 i actually woke up this morning and had about a 3 second flash of excitement in my gut that definitely stood out
8170861 it feels like were getting to believe in ourselves as a team that we can really do something we can really make a change
8170862 if anything well be the best conditioned team out there win or lose
8170863 it was reassuring to show that this is what i can do and this is what im here for
8170864 im sure he was going through some sore points with his foot and rightfully so
8170865 the great players they want to prove to their team that theyre good he hasnt had a chance to show a whole lot yet i promise you mentally inside hes thinking i want to do well and he did that does wonders for somebody
8170866 you saw that explosion through the line and then that extra gear he hit when he ran away from the safety
8170867 hes one of the most dominating receivers in my eyes in this league
8170868 to have him come and give you props is something special i wouldnt have told you a year ago or six months ago that steve smith would be meeting me in the end zone
8170869 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8170870 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8170871 but metstradamus last nights game was a great game id hardly call it the same old story
8170872 youre an idiot how about being partial in your reproting who are you john sterling
8170873 this post was stupid and pointless what on earth did this display except that youre cranky
8170874 what is wrong with you ive got to put you out of your misery
8170875 for a good time call mr met 718 577 tixx
8170876 i threw up just a little bit in my mouth
8170877 as someone who loves holiday song parodies this gets a big time thumbs up

8170910 we have highly indebted households we live on debt we dont save for tomorrow
8170911 you can only live like that if you are extremely highly leveraged thats not a basis for sustainability and thats whats wrong with the economy
8170912 price stability is important because it is inevitably the poor and workers who lose in an inflationary environment
8170913 du spirituel dans lart et dans la peinture en particulier
8170914 now to the one who works his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due and to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly his faith is counted as righteousness
8170915 the promise did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith
8170916 that is why it depends on faith in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring

8170924 i dont remember ever owning a book as a child i got my break in 1970 when i came to massachusetts on a scholarship to a boarding school each of us has a chance at the american story
8170925 the negotiations between the libyan negotiator and the hijacker have started
8170926 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
8170927 its a very active period of that balance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
8170928 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
8170929 recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of eukaryotic genes are mispredicted at the transcript level as the mispred routines are able to detect many of these errors and may aid in their correction we suggest that it may significantly improve the quality of protein sequence data based on gene predictions
8170930 some secreted proteins may truly lack secretory signal peptides since they are subject to leaderless protein secretion similarly it cannot be excluded at present that transchromosomal chimeras can be formed and may have normal physiological functions nevertheless the fact that mispred analyses of protein sequences of the swiss prot database identified very few such exceptions indicates that the rules of mispred are generally valid
8170931 interestingly even the manually curated uniprotkb swiss prot dataset is contaminated with mispredicted or abnormal proteins although to a much lesser extent than uniprotkb trembl or the ensembl or gnomon predicted entries
8170932 we plan to evaluate a group of women with lam who are experiencing shortness of breath for the presence of pulmonary hypertension
8170933 we will look at participants medical history pulmonary function tests exercise tolerance echocardiogram results and previous biopsy samples
8170934 we are hopeful this information will increase our understanding of how lam can manifest in the patients it affects in the future this information may be useful in developing better management strategies for this disease
8170935 some participants will be seen once in clinic and undergo testing with an echocardiogram while participating in this study
8170936 the individuals who have already undergone a clinical pulmonary hypertension evaluation may be able to participate through a review of select medical records and lung biopsy specimens
8170937 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8170938 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8170939 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8170940 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8170941 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8170942 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8170943 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8170944 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8170945 our study shows that these views are incorrect and illustrate the potential for the human brain to rapidly and dynamically reorganize itself
8170946 we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight and we believe that these principles may also apply to other sensory loss such as deafness or loss of function following brain injury
8170947 what the report shows is that there has been some change but its pretty minor
8170948 this isnt progress the changes are insignificant and we would need to see this happen for 10 years to say there has been progress
8170949 if you look at the numbers theres bad news in the story
8170950 and even into poverty where they are caught by the public healthcare program safety net
8170951 it doesnt capture what it costs to meet some of a familys basic necessities
8170952 even using those low standards more families especially with children are sliding into poverty and becoming eligible for public programs
8170953 it still assumes that american families spend about one third of their budget on food but whats really punishing american families are housing and energy costs
8170954 by every measure 2008 is going to be worse clearly there are going to be increasing problems growth in poverty and higher unemployment especially among unskilled workers
8170955 want to hear what their political leaders are going to do to reduce it
8170956 notwithstanding recent reductions in forecast short term global environment in which the group operates remains underpinned by long term factors and demand for our services continues to be very strong
8170957 we expect to see significant investment in new and replacement production capacity by our customers particularly in our core markets
8170958 these two bills are necessary if we are going to effect reforms in the afp the first one the term would prevent the adoption of a revolving door policy in the appointment of chief of staff because we tend to trivialize the position of the chief of staff that way and also it renders the position of chief of staff vulnerable to political pressure
8170959 for every one peso 60 per cent goes to the national government 40 per cent goes to the local government federalism is the reverse but of course looking at the other side of the coin i think it must be thoroughly studied its not as simple as that how do we divide the debt the public debt
8170960 most probably crashed thats why we are concentrating our search within a 20 mile radius

8171006 nvision will gather together top visual computing professionals world class gamers innovative artists and designers and cutting edge researchers to share their ideas experiences and passions
8171007 apparently nvidia was simply giving 55nm a test run with the newly released geforce 9800 gtx now they will implement the shrinkage to their geforce gtx 280 and 260 gpus expect the clock shader and possibly memory speeds to increase
8171008 vr zone has learned that nvidia is moving on to 40nm process much quicker than expected
8171009 we also know that nvidia is preparing to launch a 40nm chip as soon as tsmc get its act together and start pushing out half node wafers
8171010 over the past two years we have experienced a steady uptick of interest in our mashup and web scraping software in the asia pacific region and have acquired ntt docomo and kddi as customers
8171011 the timing is right to formalize our operations in the region and consequently were pleased to have fred macaraeg to lead our efforts he comes to kapow technologies with more than two decades of experience in technology companies that sell and operate in japan and knows what it takes to expand market awareness and develop channel partnerships throughout the continent
8171012 web 2 0 technologies are becoming very hot in japan and throughout asia because they can be leveraged to more easily serve the burgeoning wireless market in addition to traditional internet users
8171013 and because kapow technologies has a novel way to mashup content applications and services on mobile devices as easily as on pcs we believe there is a huge market opportunity in the region
8171014 the government has got to be seen to be helping ordinary people in these difficult economic times the price of oil is going up and therefore fuel prices are going up
8171015 my own view on the prospect of a windfall tax on energy companies is that the government will be cautious about introducing something which has an implicit retrospective element to it
8171016 a legalised raid on the companys bank accounts would be very unhelpful because it would scare off investors and also could make the cost of investment much higher and in the end that would end up on the customers bills
8171017 every 1m you take out of each company through this legalised raid is 1m they have to raise elsewhere
8171018 the negotiations between the libyan negotiator and the hijacker have started
8171019 were kind of making them feel a little more comfortable with the transition to high school rather than having them dumped right in with the teachers thats kind of intimidating
8171020 they can choose how involved they want to be in the school
8171021 it makes it a little more fun and the time goes a little faster
8171022 i can guarantee the butterflies are going and theyre nervous and jittery
8171023 on any given day were our own class c town
8171024 when it comes right down to it this town operates pretty well
8171025 its fun to see parents bring the kids to school and fun to see the kids make friends and renew old friendships
8171026 one of our goals is to improve communication with the home and with the parents
8171027 we know that parents are half of the success that we have
8171028 im hoping to hear what he proposes to do to make things better for veterans and our country
8171029 i know an awful lot about veterans such as the status of veterans affairs and such im hoping to hear as much or if he doesnt know as much that hes got people lined up who do know
8171030 they told me about 10 minutes before he came and then he showed up
8171031 i cant believe how relaxed he was and how relaxed everybody else was
8171032 the fact that hes making montana the last stop before heading to denver to accept the nomination shows that the campaign believes montana voters are eager for real change and are interested in what barack obama can do as president
8171033 after eight years of a white house waiting hand and foot on big oil john mccain offers more of the same
8171034 at a time when america should be working harder than ever to develop new sources of energy john mccain wants more of the same
8171035 the petro dictators will never own american wind and sunshine and we should never again be beholden to their barrels of crude
8171036 barack obama understands that the most important barrel of oil is the one that you dont use
8171037 if you drilled everywhere if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards even the ones he doesnt know he has that single proposition is a dry well
8171038 we want to hear them from denver to detroit from montana to mississippi from california to the carolinas we want even our men and women in iraq and afghanistan and even to sing it loud enough so that even the petro dictators can hear us lets go win this election
8171039 if you look at the list you can see that anyone whos ever shot a gophers got a speaking engagement here
8171040 this opens up the door for 850 megawatts of wind to get to the market that otherwise would never have the opportunity
8171041 the market has changed in the last 2 years with extreme difficulty siting coal facilities and the cost of wind coming down
8171042 proof of wind powers growing status as a mainstream electricity source in the western united states
8171043 our main interest in intertie is in securing transmission access for future projects
8171044 what were really after in the rockies is the wind
8171045 if you add all those projects together it could amount to several thousand megawatts of wind generation being generated in wyoming and shipped to markets across the west
8171046 i like the freedom of it im more able to do whatever i want to do in freestyle
8171047 i like bmx too it felt real natural to me the first time i tried it davis won his first ever race as an 11 year old in tucson bmx is fun and its helped me in freestyle too because ive learned to ride a lot smoother
8171048 it felt good to win against that caliber of riders
8171049 most of the kids who were in salt lake city race all the time most of them live in places where they have tracks in their home town and they can ride every day
8171050 they learned how to ride without training wheels before i did so they always taunted me about that
8171051 then pretty soon after i learned how to ride on two wheels the neighbors got a ramp in their backyard so they were daring me to do the ramp ive been loving freestyle ever since
8171052 they had a six foot wooden ramp with a big drop that was awesome
8171053 it would be great to get a bmx track here in billings so i can do that all the time i think a lot of kids would get into bmx if we had a place to ride
8171054 he took it up a notch in the partisan department
8171055 what struck me about the speech is its not the brian schweitzer he tries to portray back here in montana where he runs with lt gov john bohlinger being a republican and working in a bipartisan fashion
8171056 i think that schweitzers role was to be the partisan attack dog heading into hillary clintons speech
8171057 his role was to go on the offensive and get the crowd riled up heading into hillarys speech
8171058 its like brian schweitzer came to denver and got intoxicated with partisanship by the high altitude up there that was a full frontal attack on john mccain
8171059 thats the plan that house republican leader john boehner of ohio has been pushing and thats john mccains plan the plan he was attributing to barack obama is the john mccain plan
8171060 weve been up there the last week trying to catch the bear
8171061 i fired a shot into the grass and he crossed the river and wouldnt leave
8171062 but its also a warning to people that if bears get habituated to human food theyll do whatever they want
8171063 but i didnt want to shoot him in the kitchen
8171064 i didnt want to shoot that bear but this bear was really different the thing ill never get over is the ferocity
8171065 from the repetitive food rewards it received this bear had no respect for anyone
8171066 this thing was escalating to the point that you could see the bear getting more and more brazen
8171067 right now we know that when oil is taken down off the north slope of alaska it gets in a tanker and goes over to japan i mean that is pretty easily controllable
8171068 i think we need to make sure that if we truly want to take down the price of gas we need to make sure that the oil we allow to be taken out of the ground on our public lands in this country stays here
8171069 businesses can handle good news businesses can handle bad news but what businesses have difficulty with is uncertainty
8171070 one of the roles that the government should have is to provide that certainty to know that theres a long term commitment to alternative sources
8171071 i havent heard the specifics or details on anything else
8171072 i think if you look at the price of diesel at over four bucks a gallon i think our choice has already been made for us we just need to have the guts to do it
8171073 were fairly young we have 10 new kids to varsity but we have seven kids with varsity experience including four seniors theyre going to be a big part of the leadership
8171074 we have a good core that played in the championship game
8171075 we also had a very good jv team those kids have been waiting for their chance and this year is when theyll get it theyre ready and will do really well
8171076 i think well definitely be one of top teams in our conference
8171077 bozeman always has a very strong program and we look for billings west to do good things too but i think well be one of the top teams
8171078 weve got a core group thats been playing together for awhile now itll be a challenge but i think well do well
8171079 its a question of how our young kids can get acclimated with the varsity level thats a big step up hopefully by mid season well be competing really well
8171080 the girls were extremely upset with that loss in hamilton and they dont want it to happen again
8171081 we have a lot of returning seniors but we have some talented freshmen
8171082 they seem to be coming together as a team and seem to be working well together well have a nice mix of veterans and new young players
8171083 all community members deserve an elected well qualified educator with montana state licensure to ensure compliance of all montana school laws
8171084 for me this is not a difficult decision and not a personal one
8171085 if youre going to annex to the city then go to the city and get the zone change
8171086 all public input has noted the river as being unique and important to the people of yellowstone county
8171087 should commercial and industrial development extend all along the river must we continue it until there is no riparian corridor left in the city of billings
8171088 billings is a big enough place to have a year round functioning bmx track
8171089 we had a track here years ago it was where the bresnan building sits now
8171090 if we could get a track built here i know it would be huge it could be a facility that thousands of people of all ages and ability could enjoy year round
8171091 if someone can donate three or four acres of property that would be more than enough for the track facility and parking lot
8171092 there are plenty of areas around the edges of billings where we could put a track but what i want to do is find a piece of land thats centrally located so that distance wont exclude anyone regardless of what part of town they live in
8171093 if i had the piece of property i know we could get a track done in six months
8171094 the aba american bicycle association will jump on board and lend us the manpower and expertise to do it quickly and do it right
8171095 the 31 45 age group is the fastest growing age group in bmx right now and thats because parents are getting involved in a sport that their kids love
8171096 its a great sport in itself and its also a great workout for athletes in other sports to use to stay in shape ive seen everything from dancers to swimmers to football players competing in bmx because its fun and its a great workout
8171097 vor 500 jahren wurde amerika entdeckt aber die gemeinsame europ ische identit t kennen wir noch nicht
8171098 wir haben wir es vermieden klischees zu bedienen sondern wollten ein europa einfangen das wirklich stattfindet diese jungen menschen sprechen ber ihr europa und ihre tr ume und f hren die besucher interaktiv durch die ausstellung die menschen wissen zuwenig ber europa das herz europas soll hier sp rbar werden
8171099 its a chance to rev us up a little bit and to get us stoked
8171100 i think this year wyoming is not considered a throwaway state
8171101 we are considered an important state that deserves the attention of other states
8171102 what i sense in this convention is the time is right and this can be the year that we win so its very upbeat
8171103 democrats write off wyoming and other states at their own peril
8171104 its sort of like the fist time i went to the sequoia national forest
8171105 its an amazing and humbling experience we get a chance to meet people who day in and day out are working to make america a better place
8171106 this is history making and for me to be a part of this is wonderful
8171107 its a very good year to be a democrat and to be a democrat in wyoming
8171108 he wonders how we can encourage our young people to become active in politics when the national broadcaster refers to the as biffo
8171109 tone and context were such that its usage could not determine unfairness and partiality
8171110 the presentation was factual and professional with no evidence of intent to cause offence and or to be disrespectful
8171111 a n o ser que haja uma mudan a r pida das pol ticas a am rica do norte entrar em irremedi vel decad ncia
8171112 we knew that no one respected us i definitely think teams underestimated us the only way we can prove ourselves was to show them
8171113 our freshman year we lost a lot of close games
8171114 any team can do it once have a winning season we want to have another good season
8171115 we have a good team we have good competition in practices
8171116 youve got to be ready to work every day here
8171117 the entire team everybody on this team is key for the season
8171118 everybody wants to be in there and play but contributions during practice are just as important we have to be prepared for every game
8171119 we need everybody going in the same direction we can only focus on ourselves
8171120 we have to take it one game at a time this season
8171121 we know we can win we have to make it happen
8171122 they say around here it would be easy to protect but you never know if the wind gets blowing
8171123 they might ask us at any point to get up and go we have to be ready to evacuate at any moment
8171124 this is our high season and we had to turn away a lot of guests
8171125 horses had to be evacuated and the guests that were here had to leave
8171126 some nights the wind has been straight out of the west or northwest and weve had some smoke thats reminiscent of 1988 but for the most part its been clear skies over cody
8171127 the sherriffs department has been on top of that since day one
8171128 codys economy in the summertime is based on that road being open
8171129 there are a lot of minor complaints it burns your eyes it makes your nose burn nothing real major its like standing in front of a camp fire for a couple of days youd feel a little choked up i suppose
8171130 and i would estimate having been through both events that it seems windier today than it did for the last one were anticipating youll probably see a big acreage change tomorrow
8171131 we had more kids sign up than were anticipated this year
8171132 its been one of those things weve been wanting to focus on
8171133 weve had a couple of very good years in a row
8171134 but its important not to become complacent centrals really turned that corner and we have a lot of momentum going into this year
8171135 our main goal for this year is to make god smile in everything we do
8171136 optimism can look like commitment and loyalty when in fact i am being a coward fearful of the tough conversations and afraid of rejection
8171137 is hope a drug we need to go off of or does it keep us alive
8171138 as we are both very sensible people we make any necessary adjustments along the way before the problem gets too big
8171139 beginning today i will check my optimism is it a gift in my situation or an excuse if its an excuse hope will be a drug i try to get off of
8171140 for example the sixth grade area will belong to the sixth grade
8171141 their pod is their identity they can embrace their area and now have ownership of their area
8171142 he would only see the other eight grade core teachers during his team meeting now hes across the pod from them
8171143 between classes there are six or seven sets of eyes watching the kids and there wont be any older kids in the pods
8171144 the bullying will really decrease because weve taken those aspects right out the equation
8171145 its important for students to be comfortable and secure before they can concentrate on their school work
8171146 their social lives and their peers are their main focus
8171147 we wanted to create a space for the entire school so they can feel like it was their own
8171148 itll be a place where the kids can talk with friends and finish homework
8171149 we had space but we always had to share it with the younger kids
8171150 now we arent going to be pushing and hurrying the middle school students out all the time
8171151 so we really did want to put the library in the center of the building because reading is in the center of all education
8171152 in the existing campus we have room for meetings we dont have programs housed in closets
8171153 there arent sick kids lying on cots in the hallways
8171154 each building is more accessible safer and a better environment for everyone
8171155 the first thing you feel is appreciative the community is willing to invest in their children and that gives us a great sense of pride and responsibility
8171156 we have the space to deliver the type of education that we want to deliver
8171157 hey just wondering are the maps for 1 6 or source
8171158 nice little extra kinda bummer that i dont have css or g mod or whatever we need for
8171159 enigma the title tune full of scalar hills and dales adroitly negotiated by the horns is kisors only original composition here

8171163 they really make you feel like you have a home here and are a part of the organization whether youve been here for a couple of months or five years
8171164 especially with the new coaches here theyre really trying to get the atmosphere of being a warrior for life
8171165 the scores were extremely high for everyone everyones disappointed but what can you do
8171166 it was difficult to adjust to the time change after playing at the beijing olympics
8171167 my driver has kind of left me the last few days
8171168 and im going to do a little chipping and putting and then ill be ready to go
8171169 if i just keep my steady tempo all week ill do fine
8171170 ill try and keep them calm too since im team captain thats what im going to do and i think were going to kick some butt this year
8171171 all i remember is that 14 of the 18 holes were blind going into the green
8171172 i remember the wind was brutal out there and i see on the weather channel today its just as bad with 50 to 60 k winds out there now and only a high of 18 degrees looks like its going to be a cold week
8171173 i think we definitely have an advantage over alberta and b c for sure and onatrio where they do get much wind and we do
8171174 youve just got to make sure your tempo is slow for the big winds and if you keep it slow then youll hit the ball fine
8171175 we have a pretty good team this year with a lot of guys from saskatoon
8171176 a lot of those guys also play for the swat a lot of them were at founders cup last week for box nationals
8171177 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
8171178 you can if you wish class all science fiction together but it is
8171179 your poor son who got killed in some far gt off place for some big market interests was really somebody exceptional
8171180 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8171181 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8171182 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8171183 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8171184 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8171185 were playing everything by ear well sit down with a big sigh of relief whenever and however its completed
8171186 these folks get to be mourned get to be remembered and get to be honored
8171187 theres no doubt we have a real sense of history and depth
8171188 whats been really satisfying is so many people believe in this project they will push it through
8171189 mailsource have over ten years of experience in managing the provision of on site mail and courier screening services to clients across the uk many in what are considered to be high threat industries including several government departments
8171190 the it equipment that appeared on ebay was neither planned nor instructed by the company to be disposed
8171191 investigations are ongoing to find out how this equipment was removed from one of our secure locations
8171192 the main theme of warner was work together to solve problems
8171193 mccain has a long record of doing that barack obama doesnt
8171194 but hes not ready to lead the united states of america
8171195 im not a big fan of the prosecutions charges but i think hes got some ethical issues that put a cloud over him
8171196 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8171197 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8171198 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8171199 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8171200 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8171201 what scraps of credibility abdullah had left after march 8 are gone
8171202 nothing whatsoever has been decided vis a vis the next step because were only in the process of analysis at this stage
8171203 people who are saying another referendum or legislation they are all jumping ahead to an outcome and the government isnt anywhere near that
8171204 a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in
8171205 the government has made it clear that no option has been ruled in or out we cannot exclude that at some stage and in the right circumstances it may be necessary to consult the people once again
8171206 there can be no question of simply putting the same proposition to the people once again
8171207 there is no basis for believing that a second referendum would produce a different outcome to the one we got on 12 june
8171208 i think he is jumping the gun i dont think its helpful i dont think its helpful to be coming out in the month of august with proposals or solutions one way or the other
8171209 could have the nature of a precedent and destabilise other regions in the world
8171210 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8171211 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8171212 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8171213 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8171214 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8171215 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8171216 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8171217 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8171218 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8171219 alabama i guess i just have this feeling that there is lingering prejudice there but maybe thats totally unfair on my part
8171220 oh michigan definitely its a good thing they didnt seat us near them
8171221 i dont like states that dont vote for hillary so im really not happy with iowa right now
8171222 what can i tell you i just dont like oklahoma
8171223 were from hawaii we dont talk stink about other states
8171224 this man just took my chair knocked into me look at this
8171225 i am a clinton delegate and these obama delegates are mistreating us
8171226 its important that people of faith are being listened to just like other constituencies that were not marginalized
8171227 just because were participating in the process and engaging people who may not agree with us doesnt mean were just a mascot
8171228 lets be honest religion has been used and abused by politics
8171229 a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
8171230 reaching out to us and im not naive as to why they want our votes
8171231 but they wont get them and keep them unless they continue the momentum of adopting policies that promote the sanctity of life
8171232 id like to see obama address that say that voice is no longer welcome
8171233 i certainly didnt feel used obviously politics is politics i dont want to be naive i also dont want to be cynical
8171234 the majority of our party people they are people of faith
8171235 when we get elected we dont check our faith at the door we may not wear it on our sleeve
8171236 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8171237 and guess who voted with president bush 90 percent of the time sen john mccain
8171238 not say anything now but we are considering everything so that the passengers the 100 passengers are protected
8171239 he says he doesnt know these people and that he absolutely refuses to use such methods
8171240 destabilize security and is part of the events taking part in the darfur provinces
8171241 the u n assistance mission in afghanistan has told us the body is being transported to jalalabad
8171242 it has yet to be confirmed whether the man is mr kazuya ito
8171243 we can no longer be looked at as this couch potato what about me
8171244 if we hadnt been here we wouldnt have made those connections
8171245 barack and michelle listened and they understood it was like talking with family it became clear that they are regular people
8171246 just bringing people together so real changes can be made that affect the everyday lives of people like me
8171247 joe from next door cannot end life on the earth
8171248 the power and the story how the crafted presidential narrative has determined political success from george washington to george w bush
8171249 you start out with almost an anti intellectual strain there i want someone whos like me so they can understand me and know what i need government to be doing
8171250 to have a bad bowling score is good people see you as human
8171251 no matter how educated you are how successful you are you still need to be just folks
8171252 you want someone who you can say hes like me but i know in a crisis situation he can handle it
8171253 browzit has proven popular to a broad base of businesses but is especially attractive to those businesses that do not have their own web presence businesses need only an e mail address to list on browzit
8171254 a browzit listing may benefit businesses of all sizes but is particularly advantageous for small enterprises as it provides for free a basic internet presence greater online visibility and an additional channel for new business
8171255 it is rather hard for market players to take a position and move now amid the uncertain fate of u s government sponsored enterprises
8171256 investors are being forced to take a tentative attitude as they cannot see what lies ahead for japans economy whether or not it is going to recover in a very short period of time
8171257 running late he jumped out and started on foot for a security checkpoint that shimmered in the heat a 15 minute hike away
8171258 its blue collar to walk in casey joked he was right on message
8171259 technology is playing an important role in this convention moreso than ever before
8171260 first of all the delaware delegation was moved from the back of the floor to the front when joe biden was tapped as obamas running mate its a great view
8171261 what made me get into blogging was wanting to have a voice in politics
8171262 im not blogging from my mothers basement in my sweat pants eating cheetos
8171263 so much of what was built in that area was to county standards
8171264 it is a joy to see people rediscover the story of christs birth parents tell me they appreciate it because it brings to life the christmas story for their kids
8171265 i even went online to see if there was some sort of blog about this
8171266 all the women my age were much better dressed than i was
8171267 i have dressier clothes but i decided to be comfortable
8171268 when youre mayor of the fifth largest city in the country youre always on display
8171269 i normally dont talk about my personal life but his name is raj kundra we met a year ago
8171270 for the next 18 months ive got my hands full with work so i cant really think of marriage yet but after that i definitely want it to culminate in marriage and of course im dying to have a family at least two children
8171271 the baby is healthy he is breathing on his own mum is jetlagged but stable
8171272 i got the operative end one got the comforting end the breathe breathe breathe end and the other got the looking after the baby end
8171273 there were four of us one surgeon one orthopaedic surgeon one kidney specialist and a humble gp who was the only one whod done very much in the way of deliveries so i got that end
8171274 i think we all had fun once we knew it was all safe
8171275 she was fortunate enough to have doctors on board the flight
8171276 dad is over the moon and he has rung grandparents back in india to tell them the news
8171277 we are hoping to reunite mother and baby this afternoon
8171278 the baby is healthy he is breathing on his own mum is jetlagged but stable
8171279 if as a nation we are serious about lifting overall student performance and addressing underperformance and underachievement what we would have seen today is a statement of certainty from the prime minister
8171280 the loss of 1000 teaching positions would put upward pressure on class sizes and see the collapse of educational programs as a nation we cannot afford that
8171281 in a broad sense i think ways of rewarding high performance are welcome but the devil is in the detail mr mcalpine said
8171282 so long as its done in a way that reflects the genuine complexity and context of schools and the challenges of both leadership and teaching then i think it will be good thing
8171283 make a real difference but questioned where the funding would come from
8171284 i think it would be much better if the federal government could make direct funding to schools of an average of half a million dollars each and that funding be used to improve the learning in the school rather than the state governments having to meet the federal governments commitments he said
8171285 we are really concerned that this government is really not talking to the people it needs to talk to before its making decisions about whats best for australia she said
8171286 hes stating he knows what parents want well were not sure how hes actually engaged with the parents of state schools when he hasnt run this past the national body
8171287 we dont support any league tables weve seen what they can do in the uk weve seen cases of parents fighting with each other buying addresses raffle tickets so you can get in the line to get into a school thats higher up the league table she said
8171288 its often based on incorrect information and theres much more to a school than the academic results for a start
8171289 all of us share an interest in sustaining constructive relations between our campus police and the broader harvard community in order to provide a safe and welcoming environment for all faculty students staff and visitors
8171290 i am confident that this groups efforts will help the university address this important set of issues in a constructive spirit and forthright manner
8171291 ive been hosting moderating and mediating meetings between harvards black students and university police for much of the last 20 years and it always stems from an individual incident when african americans appear to be the subject of racial profiling by the police department
8171292 the problem is a persistent one because theres still this unfortunate assumption that equates the color of a persons skin with involvement in criminality
8171293 we look forward to any recommendations generated by the process that will help ensure the hupd remains as effective as possible
8171294 if you talk to any student in the black community theyll talk about being targeted
8171295 i hope this committee will be able to initiate a thoughtful conversation that we have not been able to accomplish to date
8171296 this is really an effort to identify what the university police do well as well as what the areas of improvement potentially are were going to go at it as objectively as possible
8171297 its important that people of faith are being listened to just like other constituencies that were not marginalized
8171298 just because were participating in the process and engaging people who may not agree with us doesnt mean were just a mascot
8171299 lets be honest religion has been used and abused by politics
8171300 a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
8171301 reaching out to us and im not naive as to why they want our votes
8171302 but they wont get them and keep them unless they continue the momentum of adopting policies that promote the sanctity of life
8171303 id like to see obama address that say that voice is no longer welcome
8171304 i certainly didnt feel used obviously politics is politics i dont want to be naive i also dont want to be cynical
8171305 the majority of our party people they are people of faith
8171306 when we get elected we dont check our faith at the door we may not wear it on our sleeve
8171307 were going to make a little history here in a couple of days with this guy i married
8171308 its a great painting and i hope it comes home
8171309 she asked me do you have our leger by chance
8171310 and she said they were sent off to be destroyed
8171311 its a tremendous loss for the college but beyond that we just dont have a lot of information
8171312 he was well known at the time for a style that had hard edges bright colors and strong geometry that stood for order and precision but in a work like this he combined that very static style with a very timeless subject
8171313 what i cant imagine is that they get through the checklist why wasnt it discovered that that painting was not accounted for thats just a question thats unanswered
8171314 its incredibly unusual for a painting of this value and frankly of this quality to disappear without a trace
8171315 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8171316 made its choice in the early hours of aug 8
8171317 deserves condemnation from the entire international community and russia must understand that its violations of international law carry consequences
8171318 the us should lead within the un and other international forums to cast a clear and unrelenting light on the decision and to further isolate russia internationally because of its actions
8171319 this contradicts the basic principles of territorial integrity and is therefore absolutely unacceptable
8171320 this is a great day for our country and for our people
8171321 russia has saved us from genocide and has granted us the opportunity to develop and live on our own land we are with russia without end
8171322 we will enforce security measures so as to prevent any act of terrorism or sabotage on the part of georgia they will try to spoil our holiday as much as they can we know from the past what kind of provocations by georgians are possible
8171323 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8171324 this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8171325 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership no way no how no mccain
8171326 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8171327 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids
8171328 were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8171329 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8171330 nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance
8171331 thinks its ok when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8171332 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8171333 the vast majority of women are thinking about their families and the future of the country
8171334 wow shes one tough cookie you heard her what i will do is take all the anger that i feel and turn it now and do all i can to help obama as a way to honor her even though the party doesnt deserve her
8171335 i want to hear specifics from him about what he will do
8171336 alabama i guess i just have this feeling that there is lingering prejudice there but maybe thats totally unfair on my part
8171337 oh michigan definitely its a good thing they didnt seat us near them
8171338 i dont like states that dont vote for hillary so im really not happy with iowa right now
8171339 what can i tell you i just dont like oklahoma
8171340 were from hawaii we dont talk stink about other states
8171341 this man just took my chair knocked into me look at this
8171342 i am a clinton delegate and these obama delegates are mistreating us
8171343 warner get a real job no ones going to want a phone in the car
8171344 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8171345 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8171346 i am not disappointed that it has been slow but it has taken a little longer than i hoped to get things in place
8171347 the biggest concern is how much money gets diverted out of here tucson to phoenix
8171348 those are dollars from a parochial point of view that will not be available here
8171349 it will slow down our ability to grow our faculty on this campus
8171350 i saw no obvious need at my first pass level for more teaching facilities
8171351 the mihs board several years ago adopted a resolution that they want to build a hospital in conjunction with ua
8171352 the maricopa integrated board has the capability of going to the ballot and going for a bond issue
8171353 i know their preference has been to get the disproportionate share money and get those funds that were intended for indigent patients so we could go ahead and build using that money
8171354 food can look taste and smell normal so you wont know the infection is there weeks after you purchased the contaminated products
8171355 we also dont know the extent of the outbreak yet and its really too soon to know now that coupled with the long incubation period makes this outbreak very concerning
8171356 both the numbers of suspected cases and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues
8171357 i think all of us expect that when we shop that the things we buy or that we eat are going to be safe
8171358 thats why i indicated that its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regimes
8171359 a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world
8171360 america remains the greatest force for good on this earth
8171361 my opponent had the chance to express such confidence in america when he delivered a much anticipated address in berlin
8171362 he was the picture of confidence in some ways but confidence in ones self and confidence in ones country are not the same
8171363 while we have our share of critics around the world when people in the oppressed nations of the world need support and solidarity and hope they look to america
8171364 they do not resent or resist americas democratic influence in the world they thank god for it
8171365 obamas not a veteran hes not a veteran why should i trust him
8171366 my reform will improve care reduce risks and broaden access all at the same time
8171367 theres always an opportunity for more commercial more retail growth and even to bring more people into the community
8171368 the 1 7 billion estimates are way outdated and theres been a lot of concern not so much with building a freeway but with exploring other possibilities first like mass transit
8171369 what the people in ahwatukee have known for years is that this was slated for the area
8171370 all of those people who have bought an ahwatukee new build home knew it the freeway was coming but they thought it wouldnt take any of their homes and wouldnt disturb any of their little space out there
8171371 today i feel vindicated and i feel that my innocence has been proven
8171372 spent a lot of money they spent a lot of time they wasted a lot of taxpayers time and most importantly they destroyed the lives of thousands and thousands of homeless children and for that they can never be forgiven ever
8171373 we are in the process of gearing up to prosecute
8171374 guilty is still guilty ask yourself when was the last time you were on probation its a big deal
8171375 they made their decisions and i guess thats the end of it as far as my office we did a very very professional investigation with a lot of time in it
8171376 theres no restitution required in my opinion because there wasnt a dime that was taken
8171377 i think the fact the kids are doing better than the national average is heartening
8171378 the manager mailed them to the treasurer yet they never got to the treasurer
8171379 various factors including a broken mailbox key and the rigorous task of collecting signatures to qualify paul newman for ballot status kept the manager from realizing that reimbursement checks were not arriving in return
8171380 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
8171381 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8171382 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
8171383 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
8171384 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
8171385 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8171386 bus riding culture jamming aldi shopping theology popping hack philosopher wannabe
8171387 right now i feel like nothing ive been writing has a definitive point of aim
8171388 i feel like you just need to keep writing until the writing itself just begins to take shape
8171389 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8171390 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8171391 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8171392 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8171393 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8171394 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8171395 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8171396 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8171397 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8171398 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8171399 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8171400 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8171401 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8171402 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8171403 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8171404 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8171405 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8171406 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8171407 sterreich ist f r uns ein eigenst ndiger markt mit enormem potenzial die er ffnung des neuen b ros steht f r lokale pr senz und soll gleichzeitig als dreh und angelpunkt f r zentral und osteuropa fungieren
8171408 vi anser att dessa resultat inte st djer de nuvarande rekommendationerna vi uppmanar dem som utf rdar riktlinjerna att g tillbaka till sina ursprungsdata och kontrollera med mer resultat innan man ger generella rekommendationer och det r helt klart att resultaten inte st djer de nuvarande rekommendationerna
8171409 ich bin gro er verfechter eines aufgekl rten patriotismus aber der hat nichts zu tun mit einem bersteigerten nationalismus der anderen menschen die gleichwertigkeit abspricht ein demokratischer rechter zeigt hochachtung auch vor anderen l ndern egal ob frankreich t rkei oder china
8171410 ja die theorie ist wirklich sch n aber nicht realisierbar

8171412 es ist eine bereicherung wenn unterschiedlichkeiten zusammenkommen dabei steht au er frage dass man sein eigenes profil behalten sollte
8171413 16 glorreiche tage die uns f r immer liebevoll in erinnerung bleiben werden
8171414 ein deutscher spitzenathlet muss immer angeben wo er sich gerade aufh lt damit dopingkontrolleure ihn aufsuchen k nnen usain bolt olympiasieger ber 100 m und 200 m wei gar nicht wie ein kontroll formular aussieht

8171416 the reason so many people misunderstand so many issues is not that these issues are so complex but that people do not want a factual or analytical explanation that leaves them emotionally unsatisfied
8171417 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
8171418 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
8171419 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
8171420 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
8171421 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
8171422 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8171423 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8171424 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8171425 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
8171426 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
8171427 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
8171428 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
8171429 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
8171430 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
8171431 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
8171432 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
8171433 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8171434 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8171435 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8171436 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8171437 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8171438 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8171439 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8171440 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8171441 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8171442 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8171443 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8171444 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8171445 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8171446 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8171447 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8171448 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8171449 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8171450 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8171451 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8171452 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8171453 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
8171454 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
8171455 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
8171456 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
8171457 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
8171458 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
8171459 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
8171460 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8171461 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8171462 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8171463 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8171464 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8171465 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8171466 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8171467 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8171468 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8171469 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8171470 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8171471 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8171472 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8171473 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8171474 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8171475 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8171476 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8171477 oh i just asked him how his summer was he said it was good then he asked me about mine i said it was good he asked me if anything was new lately i told him about my birthday party and he thought it sounded really cool especially about the limo then we talked about school a little bit and once our cookies and drinks were gone i was out of there he has a crush on emma shes my best friend that was enough talking
8171478 yea he totally kept messing me up i was trying to let him lead but he didnt know what he was doing but he was nice and asked me to dance a lot
8171479 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8171480 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8171481 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8171482 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8171483 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8171484 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8171485 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8171486 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8171487 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8171488 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8171489 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8171490 nos dimos cuenta de que algo malo suced a cuando vimos girar el ala
8171491 were no different from any other brand we need to abide by competitive law we cant do anything that would affect our competitors unfairly having an impact or distorting a view
8171492 i genuinely think bbc worldwide is out of control a kind of rogue bbc operating worldwide and not properly controlled by the bbc trust developing activities way beyond its original remit of generating spin off income from exploitation of content and formats from the uk broadcasters activity
8171493 clearly the bbcs plan now is to build up the lonely planet brand to the exclusion of any other information source
8171494 this is clearly a major event and i urge everyone to do something
8171495 if the oft thought there was a case they would do something
8171496 ive been working with jimmy and john paul and trying to do some new material and some writing
8171497 i dont know what it will be but it will be something
8171498 i really felt it was on the cards from the moment we walked off stage at the o2
8171499 at the moment all i know is i have the great pleasure to go and jam with the two guys and start work on some material
8171500 whatever it ends up as to get a chance to jam with two people like that is a phenomenal thing for me
8171501 the cane toads cannot survive in much of southern australia because they would be too cold to move about and forage or spawn
8171502 we found that cane toads can barely hop once they get below about 15 degrees celsius
8171503 their range would also be constrained by the limited availability of water for their tadpoles in some parts of australia
8171504 our study is particularly helpful in predicting where cane toads could live under climate change because we have identified a cause and effect way that climate limits the toads
8171505 in my view if don bradman was playing today he would still have an average as twice as good as any other batsman in the world
8171506 with the advances in bat technology and training imagine how good don would be today it would be scary he is by far and away the best batsman ever and would still be today
8171507 its almost like hes separate from the game his name and what he achieved its so far out of any players reach
8171508 the take home message for women is that whether you are hooked on caffeine or not if you need a boost coffee improves your mental alertness and can have a calming affect on your heart rate
8171509 in addition a large coffee has more than enough caffeine to see these changes
8171510 for people at risk for high blood pressure if youre a habituated coffee drinker reducing your caffeine intake would be an effective way of potentially reducing your blood pressure
8171511 the word towelhead is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the muslim faith or arab origin
8171512 the use of such a derogatory term by a major film studio will serve to increase its acceptability in public discourse
8171513 i think cairs objections could be remedied by simply watching the movie
8171514 wow theyre using such an unacceptable word in a movie title i wonder why
8171515 what if the characters were talking about going full jew instead of full retard
8171516 has a fresh coat of paint new tours and has been completely hot rodded out with many more bonus sites added
8171517 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
8171518 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
8171519 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
8171520 while the 1 a day poverty line remains an appropriate benchmark for counting the extent of extreme poverty in asia and the developing world more generally in a region that has witnessed rapid economic growth it might also be time to evaluate poverty incidence using a benchmark that reflects the regions dynamism
8171521 the rally has been cancelled based on the request of the authorities in view of infiltration of militants and their attacks on outskirts of the city in which some people were killed
8171522 we felt this was the right time for us to launch and invest in india which we identified as a key market as part of our west asia and asia pacific growth strategy the assistance concept is at a nascent stage here and we see tremendous potential for growth in this sector aided by the booming industry
8171523 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8171524 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8171525 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8171526 the deal clearly marks aspirations of top indian firms to play a big role on the global it services scene they are re building themselves as their age old selling proposition based on low cost quality and process superiority gets commoditised
8171527 this deal is the first yet substantial step towards building superior business transformation capability to matchtraditional back office services such as application development and maintenance
8171528 we will be meeting very soon next month or october
8171529 its still the second round before the momentum builds up and we begin to exchange lists it will take a couple of more rounds
8171530 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
8171531 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
8171532 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
8171533 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
8171534 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
8171535 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
8171536 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
8171537 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
8171538 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
8171539 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
8171540 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
8171541 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
8171542 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
8171543 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
8171544 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
8171545 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
8171546 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
8171547 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
8171548 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
8171549 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
8171550 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
8171551 a vote for obama and biden is a vote to sustain legalized child killing
8171552 the police are enforcing the laws of obstructing traffic yet they wont enforce the laws against the killing of children
8171553 there were four of us one surgeon one orthopaedic surgeon one kidney specialist and a humble gp who was the only one whod done very much in the way of deliveries so i got that end
8171554 i got the operative end one got the comforting end the breathe breathe breathe end and the other got the looking after the baby end
8171555 i think we all had fun once we knew it was all safe
8171556 after a quick meet and greet with king abdullah obama was off to israel where he made a quick stop at the manger in bethlehem where he was born
8171557 ive now been in 57 states i think one left to go
8171558 i knew it was a robbery the first thought that came to mind was to save the money he told the
8171559 in the midst of the commotion the robbers grabbed the money changers bags thinking that i had already placed the money bag onto the trolley he said
8171560 he is believed to have been snatching bags for four to five years our investigators had been calling him the chameleon as he changed clothes or wore camouflage outfits to merge into the background
8171561 by the time we radioed in that the culprit was wearing black clothes he was wearing white or red
8171562 i met the british team and they told me they had done very well
8171563 they had the best cycling team and they have a lot of gold medals
8171564 on the basis of those letters im stating today mr peters would be unacceptable as a minister in a government lead by me unless mr peters can provide a credible explanation for the owen glenn saga
8171565 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
8171566 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
8171567 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together
8171568 i am really delighted with my result i had a wonderful tutor who really deserves all the credit
8171569 i really enjoyed studying with such a sociable group of people and plan to continue with my studies from home
8171570 on behalf of the college i would like to congratulate bertie and his fellow students on receiving excellent examination results for the gcse italian course
8171571 for 93 of the class to achieve a and a grades is exceptional and testament to the hard work and dedication of themselves and their lecturer tessa barrett
8171572 employers need to take some responsibility for the impact that overwork can have on their employees health
8171573 with our research showing that a significant amount of it workers find it difficult to maintain relationships or suffer ill health the uks culture of working long hours needs to be addressed as businesses look to derive as much value from their people assets as possible during lean times it is going to be imperative that we dont drive employees to burnout
8171574 the situation with robbie is still up in the air so he wont be involved against grimsby
8171575 these things do take time especially when the agent gets involved
8171576 im not unsure about robbie im just unsure as to when it will get done
8171577 those responsible obviously do not care about the damage and disruption caused and have no consideration for the wishes of the local community
8171578 neighbourhood police teams in craigavon have in recent times worked alongside communities to tackle problems such as anti social behaviour and other low level crimes
8171579 the message from the community must be that those responsible have no mandate no authority and no support
8171580 wanton disregard of the good name of their area never mind the safety of people passing
8171581 it is very disappointing that we had a number of young people gathered last night who started to throw stones and other missiles at passing vehicles some of which contained families and young children
8171582 it is just unacceptable and very very regrettable that what was a small number of young people have caused this damage
8171583 reports of the use of a blast bomb indicate that one of the micro republican organisations are involved and i am just thankful that no was injured or killed as a result of this attack
8171584 traditionally the council respects the decision of the member in whose district the issue lies on the premise that he knows his district best
8171585 sputtered strain gauge manufacturers sputter deposit a layer of glass onto the diaphragm sputtered strain gauge sensors actually from a molecular bond
8171586 gauge pressure is measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 3 similar to absolute pressure the abbreviations pag pascals gauge or psia pounds per square inch gauge are use to describe gauge pressure
8171587 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor
8171588 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data
8171589 use it or lose it is the first principle of arctic sovereignty
8171590 our purpose is to exert sovereignty demonstrate sovereignty and security but also learn how to live off the land and learn more about the operating environment here in the north
8171591 weve seen much increased activity in terms of russian overflights of canadian airspace the americans are seeing the same thing around alaska
8171592 what many thought was a somewhat silly flag planting incident in canadas arctic
8171593 kathy was a wonderful inspiration to me when i was in high school and she was my coach and teacher she was someone who took on challenges and let you know that you could succeed at anything as long as you tried
8171594 she went above and beyond her commitment to athletic programs even taking time one summer to repaint the catholic high insignia on the basketball court
8171595 she bravely fought back from each to recover as much of her capacity as possible
8171596 and although the meningioma took its physical toll she continued to the end to make the most of her life
8171597 she had such an incredible physical ability and never complained she always worried about everyone else and lived life to the fullest
8171598 she never gave up and still thought she could overcome the brain tumor
8171599 kathy was one of the strongest willed people i have ever known she was an inspiration and mentor for how to deal with the challenges life brings you she often made fun of her own frailty she was always planning always thinking always focused on the next goal
8171600 kathy was certainly one of a kind and the most caring person anyone could ever meet
8171601 use it or lose it is the first principle of arctic sovereignty
8171602 our purpose is to exert sovereignty demonstrate sovereignty and security but also learn how to live off the land and learn more about the operating environment here in the north

8171604 what many thought was a somewhat silly flag planting incident in canadas arctic
8171605 the worst thing that could happen like an axe blow to the plane
8171606 youd have one motor pushing ahead and the other dragging in the opposite direction
8171607 as the md 82 plane has both engines on the tail close to the spine of the aircraft
8171608 i noticed the plane perhaps lacked speed then a wing dipped i clung to my seat and dont remember any more
8171609 the incident has claimed the lives of hundreds of fish mostly stone loach but also roach and pike
8171610 we are anxious to find out the cause of the pollution but our officers are also engaged in an operation to pump oxygen into the canal to protect stock
8171611 the agency would urge anyone who knows anything about this to help our investigation identify those responsible
8171612 we would also remind anyone who comes across a pollution incident to immediately contact the water pollution hotline on 0800 807060
8171613 simply wants to be left alone and serve out his sentence
8171614 he was going to receive a severe beating even if he had paid the money
8171615 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all parts of the internet are on the iphone
8171616 we noted apples argument that the ad was about site availability rather than technical detail but considered the claims youll never know which part of the internet youll need and all parts of the internet are on the iphone implied users could access all websites and see them in their entirety
8171617 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8171618 we concluded the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8171619 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8171620 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8171621 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8171622 i could have voted from my home she is our captain and we dont want to see her disrespected
8171623 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
8171624 it can be very expensive to change banking front ends and so a bank will weigh up the investment against fraud losses
8171625 single passwords are easily broken they can be guessed discovered and then used by hackers or fraudsters that want to gain access to online bank accounts
8171626 virtually nobody would disclose their cash card pins when asked so why do users disclose banking passwords in response to phishing emails
8171627 blackhats wont generally waste a lot of time trying to get banking access by guessing they tend to rely on getting the information they need directly from the victim using social engineering approaches
8171628 the latest trojans can take screenshots every time you click on the oscreen keyboard
8171629 once done the trojan then sends the screenshots to the attacker
8171630 a number of banks particularly those in the middle east appear to use the java keyboard to great success
8171631 it is still possible to log the position of the mouse on the screen and work out the character being pressed on the keyboard but its much harder
8171632 an automated system will only need milliseconds to do this and so a one minute token gives the fraudster plenty of time to conduct his her man in the middle attack
8171633 so if one is stolen one immediately knows which online bank to target
8171634 all are flawed because they rely on a shared secret which is then passed over an insecure internet
8171635 all the hacker does is sit in the middle of the connection between the bank and the user and pass on the shared secret then grab the users private information
8171636 we are also seeing man in the browser attacks now where the hacker is changing information between the user and the bank on the fly so what you see is what you get can be broken as well
8171637 each bank will have designed its fraud prevention solutions to tackle the types of fraud that it and its customers are experiencing
8171638 it is probable that different banks face different types of fraud threat to varying degrees and therefore they would need to implement relevant solutions accordingly as it stands there is no one size fits all approach however no bank has only a single line of defence in all this and there will be some form of back end security in place these are not transparent to the customer or the fraudster but will play their part in preventing fraud
8171639 with these kinds of attacks increasingly being found on reputable websites that have been hacked any visitor to the page could fall victim allowing fraudsters to grab all your login details in one go or build up a data profile over time

8171660 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8171661 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains
8171662 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8171663 its not only the weather that im not happy about here in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
8171664 throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8171665 barr on colbert so close to a discussion about global warming but no cigar
8171666 i want to get young people everywhere engaged and active and really questioning
8171667 what right do older generations have to jeopardize our future
8171668 we wanted to kick off in the most effective way possible and unite kids from all over the place
8171669 i always wanted to do something for the environment but i didnt know what to do
8171670 all would be well with the republic if only these loathesome left liberal democrats would stop destroying the democratic party i once admired and might even have joined
8171671 flamers tell themselves their enemies are so vicious they have to be vicious too
8171672 the democrats are in danger of doing to obama what they did to their last two nominees gore and kerry burying authentic individuals under a layer of prefab themes
8171673 immense is the army of michelangelos trying to sculpture the melted marshmallow of kerrys core and tumultuous is the cry of the strategists and loud are the furies of the campaign but in the center there is a silence for in the beginning all was vacuum and a void
8171674 shut them out he turned his back on the universe of geniuses and stayed true to his core identity at the core obamas best message has always been this he is unconnected with the tired old fights that constrict our politics he is in tune with a new era he is authentically the sort of person who emerges in a multicultural globalized age he is therefore naturally in step with the problems that will confront us in the years to come
8171675 is the most split personality politician in the country today on the one hand there is dr barack the high minded niebuhr quoting speechifier who spent this past winter thrilling the scarlett johansson set and feeling the fierce urgency of now but then on the other side theres fast eddie obama the promise breaking tough minded chicago pol whod throw you under the truck for votes
8171676 unconnected with the tired old fights that constrict our politics
8171677 and when democrats are nervous all the santa monica machiavellis emerge from their fund raisers offering words of wisdom and the subtext of the advice being offered this year is that barack obama should really be someone else
8171678 so long was the line of approaching volvos that it was visible from outer space yet still the message was not honed king kerry still did equivocate hedge and reverse of flip flops there were more than a few he still did velcro his principles upon the cathedral door and change them by the hour
8171679 on the one hand obama did sell out the primary cause of his professional life all for a tiny political advantage if hell sell that out what wont he sell out on the other hand global affairs aint beanbag if were going to have a president who is going to go toe to toe with the likes of vladimir putin maybe it is better that he should have a ruthlessly opportunist fast eddie obama lurking inside
8171680 ill put a plus down every time a speaker says that mccain is a good man who happens to be out of step with the times ill put a plus down every time a speaker says that a multipolar world demands a softer international touch ill put a plus down when a speaker says the old free market policies worked fine in the 20th century but no longer seem to be working today these are arguments that reinforce obamas identity as a 21st century man
8171681 use it up wear it out make it do or do without
8171682 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8171683 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8171684 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8171685 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8171686 there were only few of us who could only guess that cpu air cooler geminii will get its s version just like it was the case with cosmos case
8171687 well let you know if we can use your services
8171688 todays consumers are looking for maximum storage capacity and advanced security protection in their usb storage devices our new 16gb capacity jumpdrive secure ii plus offers the proven data protection and reliability that people have come to expect from lexar and our secure ii products with dramatically expanded storage capabilities
8171689 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8171690 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8171691 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8171692 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
8171693 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8171694 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8171695 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8171696 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8171697 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8171698 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8171699 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8171700 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8171701 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8171702 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8171703 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8171704 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8171705 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8171706 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8171707 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8171708 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8171709 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8171710 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8171711 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8171712 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8171713 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8171714 looking for high end performance on a low end budget
8171715 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
8171716 seems everyone that believes in gravity also hate ice cream
8171717 backing up data today ensures recovery tomorrow and acts as an insurance policy against virus attacks user error and failed hardware in the past consumers have been wary of backup and recovery solutions finding them to be too difficult cumbersome and expensive with drive backup express paragon is breaking down these barriers for consumers by offering a simple effective solution at no cost
8171718 with drive backup express paragon is giving end users that are currently not running a backup or recovery programme on their pc the basic survival tools they need for free
8171719 one of our companys goals is to remove the apathy plaguing consumers when it comes to backing up and encourage them to act with confidence as we believe that this is beneficial for the pc industry as a whole the more positive experiences consumers have when using their computers the more apt they will be to use them more often and try new applications with the basics for essential pc protection covered users may then choose to upgrade as they see fit to meet their individual needs through paragons upgrade path which includes a range of products offering more advanced backup tools and recovery options
8171720 it was when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt
8171721 is just helping people get set up in the morning
8171722 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama i just liked how many people had their signs up
8171723 he was put to work hed go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8171724 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8171725 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8171726 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life
8171727 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8171728 providing access to improved health and wellness with compassion and respect for all
8171729 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8171730 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8171731 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8171732 if george w bush was seeking re election wed be 20 points ahead
8171733 in arizona the only way to get around is by small private plane
8171734 we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
8171735 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
8171736 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
8171737 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
8171738 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
8171739 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
8171740 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
8171741 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
8171742 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
8171743 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
8171744 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
8171745 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
8171746 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
8171747 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8171748 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8171749 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8171750 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8171751 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8171752 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8171753 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8171754 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8171755 the same speech hes been giving for months why didnt he give the germans something more
8171756 it was a tent in the desert 100 degree heat off and on for what seemed like forever
8171757 why was i held by the united states like that when i was their ally
8171758 if theyre exaggerating and distorting this much in august what will october be like
8171759 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8171760 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8171761 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8171762 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8171763 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8171764 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8171765 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8171766 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8171767 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8171768 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8171769 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8171770 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8171771 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8171772 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8171773 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8171774 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8171775 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8171776 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8171777 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8171778 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8171779 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8171780 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8171781 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8171782 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8171783 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8171784 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8171785 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8171786 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8171787 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8171788 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8171789 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8171790 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8171791 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8171792 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8171793 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
8171794 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8171795 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8171796 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8171797 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8171798 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8171799 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8171800 what service or benefit can i add to what i give my customer other than my product

8171806 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8171807 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8171808 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8171809 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8171810 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity

8171818 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
8171819 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
8171820 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
8171821 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
8171822 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
8171823 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
8171824 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
8171825 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
8171826 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
8171827 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
8171828 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
8171829 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
8171830 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
8171831 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8171832 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8171833 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8171834 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8171835 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions

8171844 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8171845 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
8171846 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
8171847 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years

8171904 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8171905 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8171906 a colleague and a friend who has served his country with honor
8171907 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8171908 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8171909 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan
8171910 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8171911 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8171912 and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8171913 the only thing theyre going to do is in old brooklyn terms rabbit punch every day and obama has to show the american people that he can rabbit punch that he can be in that street fight
8171914 i think there was a reluctance initially in the obama campaign to engage in that i think they now realize they have to
8171915 john mccain has a great biography has been a pow
8171916 that you dont know whether i can be trusted to lead
8171917 but im just going to remind everyone here this election is not about me
8171918 its about you its about whos going to be fighting for you
8171919 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8171920 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8171921 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8171922 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8171923 barack obama has a plan to save the dream of homeownership for families whove lost their homes or fear they can never afford one unlike john mccain who has so many he cant keep track of them all
8171924 if you look past the speeches to his record its clear john mccain has never believed in renewable energy and he wont make it part of americas future
8171925 for all his talk heres the truth john mccain voted against establishing a national renewable energy standard he voted against tax incentives for renewable energy companies and for all his talk of drilling he refused to endorse a bipartisan effort to expand domestic oil production because that bipartisan proposal would end tax breaks for big oil
8171926 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement over the issue of abortion
8171927 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him

8171936 he should have got life or a lot longer than six years the law over here is too lenient in other countries he would have got life im not happy he could have got a much longer sentence he didnt admit he had done wrong he wouldnt admit he was in the bus lane or was speeding
8171937 i dont have any sympathy for him in a way i wish my son had been killed outright rather than suffering as he did
8171938 he was just a lovely lad he would do anything for anybody he got on with his friends very well

8172024 i think the people of assam cannot ask for anything more as all these world class institutes could go a long way in developing the state in terms of human resource development
8172025 the package is really noteworthy as the prime minister instead of just doling out cash incentives decided to go for specified projects and that too with a vision aimed at developing the skills of local youths by way of setting up several top notch educational facilities
8172026 i have never come across a prime minister like manmohan singh who has generously agreed to all our proposals this shows how sincere and committed the prime minister is to the welfare and development of the state
8172027 i think all these time bound projects would help develop assam by leaps and bounds

8172030 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
8172031 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
8172032 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
8172033 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
8172034 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record

8172042 the maltese government is making a small monetary contribution of 23 000 to the peoples republic of china the relationship between our two countries mr ambassador is more than one of mere mutual respect it is one of mutual understanding and assistance

8172044 the authority believed that the north side of the island needed an area of entertainment to boost tourism

8172054 love is patient refers to the temperament that patiently accepts injuries without desire for revenge
8172055 it bestows benefits on others and in this sense is the reverse of long suffering which receives injuries from others
8172056 the hard environment of an evil world gives love an almost unlimited opportunity to exercise this sort of kindness
8172057 but when the goodness and loving kindness of god our savior appeared he saved us not because of works done by us in righteousness but according to his own mercy by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the holy spirit whom he poured out on us richly through jesus christ our savior
8172058 or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience not knowing that gods kindness is meant to lead you to repentance
8172059 this may sound drastic but i have put it in gods hands and now have peace knowing that this is the best way to put this disease in check

8172211 van gaal had het contract van de columnisten opgezegd dus ik wist niet beter dat het zou stoppen later had ze het nog wel over een andere naam voor het blad maar ik heb niets meer gehoord ok dan kappen we er mee dacht ik tot ik het blad weer zag liggen
8172212 ze kiest er z lf voor niet op de hoogte te zijn wij sturen haar van alles maar ze reageert niet
8172213 vooral vooraan zijn er altijd een paar die te lang zonder drinken in de hitte van tegen elkaar drukkende mensen staan
8172214 een team bestaande uit ghor ambulance politie brandweer gemeente en evenementenorganisatie houdt continu een vinger aan de pols wordt het naar hun inzicht te druk dan wordt uit voorzorg de markt afgesloten en kunnen er indien noodzakelijk snel extra ambulanceposten worden ingericht en hulpdiensten worden opgetrommeld dat is gebeurd
8172215 i always had him in the back of my mind as far as just when id get down and worried about myself id think about what he was doing and what he was going through
8172216 he was a little bit of a motivation for me just to keep going through everything
8172217 when he enlisted in the military i never thought hed be going to war as many times as he did
8172218 i just had to support him and i got to talk to him here and there and i could hear helicopters in the background it was pretty wild
8172219 what ive liked about cody since hes been here is he has really developed as a player he transitioned from a core special teams guy and was able to work at outside linebacker then he worked in the sub package hes also worked at inside linebacker so hes created position flexibility
8172220 i thought i did pretty good in training camp last year as far as learning the system and establishing myself as an outside linebacker but then sitting out and having to watch all year it just kind of gives you the desire to get back out there
8172221 its nice to be out there and its nice to be healthy getting to play all different positions and learning everything
8172222 if it was the real season and i was getting sacks like that it would be pretty cool but i would say preseason doesnt really count as much
8172223 when youre on ir youre just sitting there and you feel like youre just wasting away
8172224 none of the coaches really associate with you anymore because youre not playing football it was hard but my brother was a motivation for me
8172225 cody really developed a preparation routine and that routine hes followed hes been disciplined with it and you see the jumps in his play as hes stayed with it
8172226 i grew up on the coast in south texas and my dad works on oil rigs so i was either off shore with my dad on an oil rig or i was shrimping with my grandpa
8172227 my grandpa would come and pick me up and it was an opportunity to make some good money as a kid most people might think its a little weird or redneck but if you ever got a chance to do it youd see it was pretty cool
8172228 when the net came up and everything got dropped out you had to separate the shrimp from all the fish and everything like that
8172229 thats pretty much all i did i put all the shrimp in the ice box and wed load them up on the dock and sell them

8172234 i would say the one time we came from behind and won in 2004
8172235 and the 2008 all star game which ill never forget id have to say those two things are some of the biggest memories of my career
8172236 the stadium just in general is something you think of later on when youre done playing the game you look back and think how great it was and talk about how great it was
8172237 for me i dont put things in perspective until later down the road so it probably wont hit me until next year when were playing in the new stadium
8172238 it was a great experience dressing in the yankees clubhouse taking it all in and the history thats been part of this organization
8172239 going in as a visiting player looking forward to having a lot of fun in a boston uniform is a little different but as far as the environment goes with the way they presented the old players and the historic side of baseball it made it really cool
8172240 getting knocked out in the fifth inning of the game a big game a game that we needed to win its extremely frustrating
8172241 i hate it i didnt get it done i wish i could say i felt terrible but i felt pretty decent i was able to throw all my pitches where i wanted to i couldnt get anybody out
8172242 i had two outs was hoping to have a 1 2 3 inning and then the inning turned into a horrible inning
8172243 if hes locating and we feel he can make the next step then were going to do it
8172244 no i dont think so i dont think the hitters are going to be any different just to see them i dont know
8172245 the thing is that im not striking out like i did last year
8172246 i hope i can tell you more about it at hot chips next year
8172247 its a lot easier for customers to put off the purchases of servers some software and applications and even desktops than it is to put off storage purchases
8172248 once a company moves into the digital world information just piles up youve got to have some place to put it
8172249 the emergence of content rich business applications in areas such as telecommunications media entertainment and web 2 0
8172250 customers can really get great bang for their buck in buying new storage systems
8172251 people have increasingly been buying storage not just to store the data but also because they want to parse out components for analysis
8172252 i always had him in the back of my mind as far as just when id get down and worried about myself id think about what he was doing and what he was going through
8172253 he was a little bit of a motivation for me just to keep going through everything
8172254 when he enlisted in the military i never thought hed be going to war as many times as he did
8172255 i just had to support him and i got to talk to him here and there and i could hear helicopters in the background it was pretty wild

8172267 our kids lives are more complicated than ever we created schoolpulse to solve a problem that we understand very personally this is all about enriching our childrens education and simplifying family life its a great way to keep up with your kids
8172268 were taking these steps out of an abundance of caution
8172269 anything that is going to ensure the safety of others is necessary
8172270 if it means going a roundabout route safety should be a priority
8172271 any time we have a problem with the bridge it has a negative impact for business
8172272 hopefully it will not discourage people from traveling to the eastern shore
8172273 september business is very very compatible to if not a little busier than the month of june

8172278 uh meredith coach spurrier down at south carolina calling you at about 1 35
8172279 the reason i didnt put duke down there at no
8172280 grant teaff is a man i admire and respect good guy and he asked me not to do it
8172281 so the dukies didnt get a vote this year but ill be pullin for the dukies put that in the paper im pullin for em every game see ya bye
8172282 uk is a huge game for us as far as rivalry
8172283 the first game is always the most important game no matter who were playing but just the fact that its uk spices it up a little bit we just need to go out there and make it a victory
8172284 its good playing them as the first game of the year because we can focus on them all summer and through camp its hard starting off the year and then having a rivalry game third game of the year
8172285 when i first got here i didnt understand the rivalry
8172286 there are a lot of uk fans in louisville and theyre always willing to voice their opinions and it seems like theres always a u of l fan there to voice them back its a great rivalry everyones real enthusiastic about this game
8172287 i think uk is a very good football team especially since theyre going to build off their success from last year
8172288 its the state championship so to speak we respect how good theyre going to be this year but were going to be ready and do everything we can to play a very good football game
8172289 we think hes going to do a great job for us this year hes worked extremely hard this summer hes paid his dues being in the system for four years now going on his fifth year hes somebody who likes to throw the ball down the field and hes got a great arm
8172290 theyre trying hard to do the things we ask them to do
8172291 they are being physical and learning the package and we expect them to be ready to go
8172292 we need to bring our best game because we know theyre going to be ready to play certainly theres a lot of questions on both sides particularly a lot of new faces on the offensive side for both teams
8172293 in fact most of the time you play your rival its on the last weekend but the governors cup is unique its even more unique because we start the season with it
8172294 its a great opportunity to start the season against southern we are looking forward to saturday because it is going to be a festive event
8172295 there is going to be a lot of people there and we are looking forward to a sold out stadium
8172296 we are going to get their best shot we are going to have to be prepared play hard and execute
8172297 they are a good team they are going to have good athletes and be well coached i have always had a lot of respect for southern head coach pete richardson he has won a lot of games his teams are always well prepared and play well
8172298 it was a difficult decision both keenum and junior blake joseph are good enough to win and win championships with it just gets down to one guy doing something a little bit better than the other one and that doesnt take away from either of them both of them are capable and its a good position for us to be in as a team
8172299 we would like to have about eight guys who could go for the first game and just see how that does mark hafner is pretty interchangeable at tight end and wide receiver
8172300 and up until about a year ago we had a small little trio that played on kent island and various places
8172301 it was sort of like an allman brothers jam it just went on and on
8172302 thats just one of the many ways he and martin omalley are the same
8172303 i had a number of people who said they enjoyed it
8172304 my view is that people who are involved in music oftentimes theres some depth there theyre not completely focused on simply politics i think its a good thing lifes a balance
8172305 we became very good friends during the campaign and served on 23 forums or fora together
8172306 because hes barth and im beilenson we sat next to each other we could finish each others sentences
8172307 howard county alone in the united states is providing health care for all
8172308 i loved tony the tiger too i even ate cereals with sugar since kids do need some energy in the am to get a kick start carrots dont cut it but i never wanted to be captain crunch and wear a naval jacket join the navy get a boat
8172309 they took a big chance its not like people wanted to im trying to prove i can be one of those guys who can play out there
8172310 good football player with a chance to be a really good football player
8172311 my real fans know what that means tune in aug 30 just tune in aug 30
8172312 some of these guys are getting chances now they otherwise wouldnt and i think theyre all excited for it
8172313 all these kids want to play and now they actually see an opportunity to play
8172314 i know these guys pretty well and i know how they run their routes and they know how i throw the ball so when it comes down to it we just have to go out there and perform as a unit and perform as an offense
8172315 bruce came over and gave us a big boost mentally and physically
8172316 hes an experienced guy who knows what it takes to win hes been giving us confidence and making sure we are going through everything hard he gave us such a big boost when he came over in terms of motivation and confidence
8172317 the thing that impresses me most about him is the way he works
8172318 hes 235 pounds runs a 4 6 40 yard dash hes got real good hands he can run and he can block
8172319 we have two main running backs but elliot and bonner are two guys that have abilities that we want to get into the game
8172320 that can make something happen with the football in their arms and can help us win games
8172321 i dont think one will probably play more than the others right now well know more about that after a couplegames
8172322 right now youve got to feel like derek sherrod is a mainstay there at left tackle hes a young man who played 300 snaps as a true freshman a year ago and i feel like hes got an opportunity to be a really really good player
8172323 four of those guys have seen extensive action in southeastern conference play
8172324 theyve given us great leadership and theres no reason not to expect a great year out of them
8172325 those are three good linebackers to some degree as good as youll find
8172326 if we can keep those three on the field ill feel good
8172327 we are witnessing unprecedented growth in smaller towns and cities and plan to increase our geographic presence in such places with launch of the radio phone r300 the growing popularity of the radio in the tier two and tier three cities has created a tremendous opportunity for penetrating such markets and we are confident that our new offering will be well received by our consumers
8172328 were going to be young initially but once those guys get their feet on the ground i think we have the potential to be pretty good
8172329 all in all when its all said and done we should be as good if were playing the way we can
8172330 its a similar move as ex hawkeye and nfl linebacker chad greenway
8172331 greenway was a quarterback safety in high school so you know were just trying to get guys in the best spots we do want to be more athletic we were saying that in the 80s
8172332 its always a goal to get more athletic at linebacker but you still want to have good football players out there too
8172333 i think the thing that has to happen is we got to pretty soon decide who that guys going to be and then start giving that guy most of the reps
8172334 there are three guys in there and were trying to give everybody a shot but eventually the worst thing about coaching is deciding whos going to play some guys are and some guys arent
8172335 guys are going to look to me and guys are going to be counting on me to get some stuff done whereas people were looking to hump and klink last year
8172336 seeing how they prepared mentally the kind of time they put in
8172337 its stuff that a coach can tell you but when you see a guy do it and it pays off on the field i mean thats all you really need to see
8172338 whoever steps into those two positions its going to be a good corps
8172339 the two other jobs are kind of open right now and whoever fills them is going to be a young guy it was kind of like the position i was in last year you just got to keep getting better every week learn from your mistakes and just kind of keep building
8172340 it doesnt have much to do with last year or next year or anything
8172341 im really really fired up and anxious to see how we perform
8172342 im not making any prediction i dont know whats going to happen but im just really anxious to see how this team has come together and what were going to be like when we take the field
8172343 weve got a lot of talented guys guys that we feel like can do the job so the competition is tough at the position
8172344 we feel really good about the choices we have and were just trying to get the right guys out there
8172345 in certain situations their size could possibly affect some play calls
8172346 they have a nice catching range not only are they tall theyve got long arms and the catching range is pretty big
8172347 theres not a junior or a senior thats in front of them those puppies are learning how to bite right now and by the time we start the first game theyll be well versed in learning how to bite and know how to hold on when they do bite
8172348 from a demographic perspective 2007 may really end up being the final good year of the decade
8172349 i think it will be said that 2007 will be the last year of american economic expansion
8172350 its confirmation that howard countys location business climate and quality of life combines to make it a compelling location for business
8172351 the entire nation is on the precipice of a significant economic downturn and howard county is not immune
8172352 how is it possible that the wealthiest state in the wealthiest nation in the world has a rising poverty rate and such a high poverty rate
8172353 i was astonished to find about 50 people representing a wide range of ages from young mothers to seniors all waiting to apply for some type of benefits
8172354 people are having to make choices about whether to put food on the table or buy gas to go to work
8172355 even our most talented students academically have said this is a really long test
8172356 now they are taking it once and then they are taking the act
8172357 the act folks have done a wonderful job of marketing their product to the mid atlantic colleges
8172358 we want to make sure we do all the preparation work
8172359 i suspect it is an urban myth that the act is easier they are all college prep tests
8172360 its so good to be on american soil and its so good to just be the duke coach
8172361 its really good being the duke coach having won the olympics
8172362 you are representing your country and trying to show respect for the world to be a part of that and win the gold medal i dont think you can get any better
8172363 there was a big duke influence in helping that culture come around
8172364 these guys behind me associate head coaches chris collins and steve wojciechowski and basketball operations director chris spatola are behind the scenes including the guy we lost to stanford johnny dawkins they work tirelessly with our team with no recognition
8172365 it was 36 years later and it was kind of a fulfillment
8172366 they were goofing around saying im going to mess up your hair
8172367 and usually you try to stay real clean and youre hugging all of those guys and by the time you went to the press conference i said i stink and i said you guys really worked hard today there were a lot of good memories

8172371 its a contract for both designing and building the vessels and most groups do either design or build
8172372 so they have to make partnerships in order to bid on that and that takes some time
8172373 unless you arrived here on a horse or walked or rode a bicycle you are part of the oil industry
8172374 all were doing is asking the state to reexamine their stand on abandoning any kind of offshore drilling
8172375 i dont believe a spill of that magnitude could occur
8172376 i would like to dispel some of the myths set forth in the proposed letter for the governor

8172381 it would be naive to assume they wont be targeted
8172382 the taliban have shown a capacity to strike in places where they werent active before and that is an issue
8172383 in the early stages of reconstruction there is a risk management issue
8172384 it depends on the region and in those regions where security risks are highest you have to approach it differently
8172385 its appropriate that its not just foreigners who are delivering the aid
8172386 its only the latest in a long line of examples of discomfort and ideology impeding an effective response to hiv
8172387 were talking about primarily sex and drugs and those topics are laden with all sorts of baggage
8172388 drug use and drug users are bad and the way to deal with it is to crack down on it and lets have mandatory minimum sentences for drug offences
8172389 its a very ostrich like approach i think sticking ones head in the sand and ignoring the reality and just maintaining a very black and white notion of how to deal with a public health problem thats actually quite complex
8172390 you need to have a range of interventions and it really needs to be driven by what the best available evidence is what the public health problem is and what solutions might address it
8172391 i dont think its that much money certainly members of parliament didnt think it was an unreasonable amount five years ago when they said this is what it should be

8172393 she was always involved in the community still is at age 90 in sackville n b
8172394 she inspired me as a teenager to do things for people
8172395 it just made me feel good that my friends and i did that
8172396 in 1980 i saw the need to get kids off the street
8172397 the first presbyterian church had a hall that the powers that be allowed us to use for friday night dances we drew full houses of 12 to 16 year old youngsters many of whom knew me because they were always with our kids in our basement
8172398 from the time i started high school i wanted to be in the rcmp
8172399 like all young fellows in those days i had respect for the police and i wanted to be helpful to the community it was a great challenge to qualify in those days because they hired in bulk and i had to wait until they had enough candidates to hire me
8172400 because i could serve the people in the communities i met more good people than bad even some you arrest arent totally bad they made a mistake and our job was to guide them in the right direction people i arrested thanked me at the time they were in court and certainly in later years
8172401 every detachment in which i was involved has members and their spouses too who were involved with young people
8172402 its heartwarming to see seniors and the disabled catch the trout and enjoy outdoor recreation
8172403 and volunteering keeps me busy i get pleasure from helping someone who might not have that enjoyment if you werent there to help i learn from them too these people are a wealth of information and some of its true
8172404 theres certainly no need for someone whos retired to say they have nothing to do
8172405 my question is what are they going to plug it into
8172406 it took us three years to get the power company to waive the cost of the poles and the wires
8172407 i dont know of any other 200 series highway that doesnt have power
8172408 its so easy to demolish a building thats been there for 100 or 150 years we just dont value them
8172409 in the past 20 years slowly but surely most of our heritage buildings are disappearing
8172410 theres a glimmer of hope that we hope the guy is not going down the wrong path
8172411 so they allow him to participate in this program and they actually sit down and if the victim shows up they work things out
8172412 it doesnt seem the boy in court tuesday gets the seriousness of this
8172413 this video is not the worst ive ever seen but this behaviour is still disturbing
8172414 my question is what are they going to plug it into
8172415 it took us three years to get the power company to waive the cost of the poles and the wires
8172416 i dont know of any other 200 series highway that doesnt have power
8172417 the enjoyment he brings to the workplace is just unbelievable
8172418 they may be involved in vocational programs or they may just be at home wishing they could be employed
8172419 there is a great deal of education to be done about the abilities and the skills and the value of people with intellectual disabilities
8172420 these people can learn jobs and carry them out and they do them conscientiously and with pride

8172425 i accelerated and stopped about 500m further down the road
8172426 when i stopped he rearranged how he was sitting on the bonnet and then i drove at about 40 or 50km h into town

8172428 three individuals who are close friends of mr sperry chose to continue on their own with an unofficial search attending areas they felt were well known to mr sperry and in their efforts they came across the remains
8172429 but he also had a tilt to his pelvis and some back pain his symptoms were very similar to whiplash
8172430 a remarkable victory and one to be enjoyed because to be totally honest we are always on the receiving end of thrashings like that
8172431 in the four or five years i have played one day internationals we have not hammered a team as convincingly as that before
8172432 the way the guys have turned themselves around has been remarkable
8172433 really exceptional but i think i am in a fortunate position to have four bowlers bowling at 90 miles per hour and i am sure if previous captains had them firing on all cylinders at the start of their campaign or whenever it was i am sure they would have been alright
8172434 it is great being a part of this bowling unit
8172435 you have got the knowledge and experience of fred and harmy who are always passing it on and its thoroughly enjoyable
8172436 the wicket had some bounce in it from a good length it didnt have demons in it but the nicks went for us and we took our catches
8172437 it is reaching the point right now for me i probably shouldnt have played in this game where we look to the medical team and see if we can come up with something
8172438 when you play like we did today people paid a lot of money for the tickets and they would have been very disappointed there wasnt a better game
8172439 obviously losing world cup semi finals is bad but outside that it has to be the worst in terms of the way we lost the way things happened today
8172440 we came off such a high in the test series some of the best moments in my career and this is right down there in terms of the lowest
8172441 we have to regroup pretty quickly take this blow on the chin come back from it and play our kind of cricket
8172442 your confidence can take a big dent when you lose like this
8172443 we have to look at ourselves and match an england team that we have matched many times since i have been involved in this set up
8172444 i just like to concentrate on what we do and on what we do well
8172445 at the moment were turning up for training sessions on form on time and hammering the training session out
8172446 that is the important thing to me the recipe for success is the work you put in before matches and every single guy is turning up doing that in those sessions
8172447 the key for us is not for any of us to gob off about anything because we havent won anything yet
8172448 our main goal is to win the series and our team is performing to the level they should be doing
8172449 its a good time for him right now to recharge a little bit
8172450 we talked about this internally for a couple of weeks
8172451 its a good time for him right now to recharge a little bit

8172468 this is not an over statement of income people make money in different ways some reported and some not some make a lot of cash and never disclose how much cash they have made
8172469 i personally could ill afford to not have tony wallnofer as the director of transportation
8172470 directly or indirectly as a buyer or bidder in any vehicle auction
8172471 knowingly purchase from any dealer a vehicle that the dealer had purchased at a vehicle auction conducted or managed by or for the towing section

8172475 senator currie in my opinion is guilty of making a terrible mistake
8172476 knowing him i believe it was absent mindedness still he lobbied the government on behalf of a private entity for personal profit
8172477 it is certainly something that will be undertaken by a legislative ethics committee
8172478 and i think that he needs to be allowed to explain exactly what occurred
8172479 i was of the impression that we would wait until the investigation has concluded and decide from there whether there is any basis for any action
8172480 now that were here i dont know why weve never been here before
8172481 from the time we take the first horse off the truck to the time we get the last horse hooked up to the wagon takes less than 30 minutes
8172482 some of them dont like the sound of the clippers
8172483 theyre what we call very docile horses very easygoing very adaptable to all sorts of situations whether its climate noise people
8172484 being a male they are larger than the average this way we have a very calm horse and a very large horse out there for display
8172485 they just know when the harness goes on that its time to go to work
8172486 theyre great to work with and im just very proud to be working when them and representing the company
8172487 its going to have to be in the 4 to 5 range or its not going to float
8172488 obviously this is what we have to determine through the survey but i suspect that people are only willing to pay slightly more than a bus or a link service
8172489 if someone has to get in their car drive to the ferry find a place to park and then get on the ferry thats not going to fly at 2 or 7
8172490 but if we get people in and out efficiently if they can walk or shuttle or use a park and ride and make the price affordable then i think it could be interesting
8172491 im not ready to sign off on this yet i want to see the study and i want to see the cost because if its not going to be used then im not going to buy in
8172492 council has not definitely said go ahead were doing this
8172493 and i think many of us on council will continue to do that
8172494 is certainly more than the last information we had which showed us people would be less likely to use it if it were anything over 4
8172495 we have to make sure people are going to use it otherwise it would be a huge waste of money
8172496 we would expect that as the fares increase the number of people who would ride it would drop
8172497 but to understand where the cut off points are we need to test a fairly extensive range
8172498 our expectation from the first study is that the ferry can break even that it can cover its operating costs by fares
8172499 but well confirm that with the upcoming review of the business case based on this new market data
8172500 it costs us more to operate but it also increases the number of people who want to take the service so it pretty much evens out in the end
8172501 vi uma equipe com vontade de vencer a ra a do primeiro tempo contou muito para o triunfo parcial
8172502 when your dealing with outside branches or los and a big company has a larger target on their back than most a company can do a great job with compliance and still get into a mess of one kind or another
8172503 guess 80 percent of their los are non performers during this downturn large companies with commission only loan officers will have to downsize or bought out during this tough period
8172504 have barack and hillary made up yet is michelle obama a scary angry black woman or is she a phony pretending not to be a scary angry black woman what do the democrats have to do to prove that they dont hate america
8172505 its just not true that these issues are not being discussed
8172506 did you hear mccain talk smack about obama it was totally fed up is obama gonna let him punk him like that
8172507 if i accept 88 of the bpo on a short then on average ill lose less than if we take it back through foreclosure
8172508 ok you can do the short refi and we want x dollars for the property
8172509 well keep doing it until we find the right way
8172510 i think the whole ballpark knew he wasnt going to swing but he put on a good show
8172511 its frustrating but with this team in this stadium you never know
8172512 and in the course of winning a championship there will be some damage to some folks in order to do that thats the sacrifice thats the cost thats the price of a championship somebody has to do something that theyve never done before somebody has to play more games do more than theyve done before thats the price that you pay
8172513 in the last couple of games its almost like he didnt leave hes not quite the hitter but that will come that has to come playing games i think hes at a point now where he has to be one of those four or five guys thats in there every day one of those foundational pieces
8172514 last year it was frustrating i did some pretty good things but i didnt play as well as i wanted to all the time i figured that with me being able to go out and practice on a consistent basis i wont have those peaks and valleys and lows and things like that i can just stay on one even plane and just try to be great every sunday
8172515 im just going to go out and just continue doing things that i do on the football field and just try to be great each week and be consistent just try to go out and make my team better any way i can everything else out of that will take care of itself
8172516 weve just got to make the best of this week and then next week
8172517 i think our timing will be fine he knows what hes doing i can read his body so its just a matter of making sure our timing is fine but i think we can get that back together in a week

8172528 no hay l mites de lo que podemos hacer por am rica pero ser imposible si no luchamos juntos para conseguir que los dem cratas lleguen a la casa blanca por eso nos unimos bajo la figura de obama necesitamos un presidente en el que confiemos para solucionar los problemas

8172537 hes going to be pretty excited for me and i got to give him this he plays fantasy baseball and i was in his lineup today hes probably the only guy in fantasy baseball anywhere who actually played me
8172538 but ill probably say something like we got your yankees tonight
8172539 theyre loud i killed the rally no one is more frustrated than me everyone is desperate for wins on a night like tonight i was booing myself
8172540 though i thought ive had better years maybe it was a down year in the international league
8172541 i threw a good changeup in a good count to bailey i think his name is bailey and he rolled it right down the line and off the bag
8172542 he doesnt know me its obvious my first two at bats he was throwing all fastballs and it was working he was throwing me in in in
8172543 im just wishing my family wasnt watching the game then i could tell them that i had two line drive hits

8172546 you have to attack every game as though youre playing your rival
8172547 the student who is never required to do what he cannot do is often unable to what he can do
8172548 my team expects me to get big hits and make big plays tonight i didnt do that
8172549 you keep putting him in those situations and you know hes going to come through ill take him in those situations every time he can change the complexion of the game in one swing
8172550 its not the way i drew it up when i came to the park today
8172551 it was the biggest pitch in the game he was in a position where one pitch could turn the whole game around if alex gets a hit there they have their lefty hitters coming up and they get the ball rolling
8172552 the surgery went well the knee looked good the prognosis is very very optimistic for a full recovery
8172553 hopefully something will work out in the long run hopefully in the short run too
8172554 customers with hundreds of trailers in their yards found that even with previous generation yard management systems and rf technology tracking and locating individual trailers for yard movements and audits was challenging especially when you consider the impact of the weather elements those without system support were even worse off but the ability of rfid technology to read all of the tags in a given area makes finding trailers and verifying movements a natural by product of proximity to fixed or mobile readers this makes yard management more accurate and efficient

8172563 and each generation needs to explore the history of the past to understand fully the context in which these polar extremes come into clashes with one another so history of how we dealt with these problems in the 1940s and 1950s is a current history and a history that is very important for us to understand
8172564 the mdc movement for democratic change does not want to come in apparently this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse

8172575 the economic health of galveston is pretty sturdy but we have a sense that people are more pinched by the cost of food and fuel
8172576 we want people to recognize what it has done in the past to touch the community

8172581 he was not totally unconscious but it was hurting him he was moving his arms when they took him away on the stretcher
8172582 a witness near him saw what he believed was a spark of electricity between him and the tool he was reaching for
8172583 a few guys saw it but im not sure if it hit him or right beside him

8173015 its hard to harmonize when you dont know the tune
8173016 people have questioned what senator clintons motives might be going into this speech
8173017 is it possible and i know in this cynical year it seems almost silly to ask this question but is it just not possible that she could genuinely believe that the nation cant sustain itself with another four years of republican rule and that thats the motivation going into tonights speech for her
8173018 sen hillary clinton tells convention delegates barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8173019 s dy s niezdecydowane w sprawie koszt w podwy szenia kapita u sp ki
8173020 zwolnienie z podatku darowizn otrzymywanych przy kl skach nie jest atwe
8173021 i aint pro human because all humans aint pro black
8173022 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8173023 to fight for an america defined by deep and meaningful equality from womens rights to gay rights from ending discrimination to promoting unionization to providing help for the most important job there is caring for our families to help every child live up to his or her god given potential
8173024 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8173025 remember before we can keep going we have to get going by electing
8173026 i aint pro human because all humans aint pro black
8173027 i would fight for my liberty so long as my strength lasted and if the time came for me to go the lord would let them take me
8173028 cele doua femei erau goale si s au sarutat intr o maniera foarte sexy dupa care s au rostogolit in pat a fost surprinzator sensual si salbatic
8173029 you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8173030 at that point of the game its difficult for anybody to come in and try to play
8173031 you make mistakes you try to force balls late in a game trying to win
8173032 the big focus this week was getting the punt off
8173033 i wanted her to have a new experience and i heard good things about charter schools
8173034 i wanted the parents to understand that weve got this
8173035 my students are all coming here with gifted and talented status
8173036 whatever its in well find it and whatever were lacking well find it
8173037 biden allies note that despite his long service in washington he is at his core an outsider inside the beltway while that may well be true the optics for obama arent great he cant change the fact that in picking biden he would be going with someone who has spent nearly his entire adult life not only in politics but as a member of the worlds greatest deliberative body
8173038 traditionally the council respects the decision of the member in whose district the issue lies on the premise that he knows his district best
8173039 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
8173040 there is such an impressive field of 145ers out there that we felt it was very important to add this weight class and this group of exciting fighters
8173041 with what we have done with the lightweights in creating a stellar crew of contenders and up and comers we felt it was very possible to do the same with the featherweights
8173042 but what were going to do differently is sign a stable of 16 20 fighters at 145 pounds and they will all be upper echelon guys we will have the deepest roster of featherweights and make this a high profile division the top guys will fight each other which will create a proper champion and a great cast of contenders
8173043 educating children about landmines is so vital for childrens futures
8173044 with landmines and unexploded ordnance lying in homes fields rivers and schools in ethiopia and other countries i can really see how unicefs mine risk education is an essential life saving intervention
8173045 it would be good to do south to north america weve done
8173046 weve basically taken a ton of lessons that weve learned from lonelygirl15 and katemodern and were applying it to this new series trying to make it more accessible to a passive audience
8173047 during the week rather than it being five videos that are these posts that the characters are making leading up to this episode its going to be a text blog maybe a photo post its not all going to be video content
8173048 i love buffy and im a big joss whedon fan
8173049 some of the commenters on our forum were on the original buffy forum back in the day they were calling the world of lg15 originally the breenaverse
8173050 in general its certainly great to have the big traditional people and new media companies producing content for this space
8173051 it helps consolidate the medium it makes advertisers feel more comfortable and it just makes the market bigger
8173052 after 2 years of minority government thats probably the inevitable result so thats the reality of the situation
8173053 nobody has any idea what is his agenda maybe not even himself
8173054 the other party has tabled an economic agenda that remains diametrically opposed to everything this government stands for
8173055 i think you really have increasingly in parliament two visions of where we should be leading the country particularly during challenging economic times and thats something im going to have to reflect on
8173056 this prime minister is panicking inventing reasons to trigger an election
8173057 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in the space of a few weeks
8173058 its my responsibility as prime minister to make a decision on whether i think the fall session of parliament can be productive if i dont think it can be productive then obviously its my responsibility to make sure the people of canada can elect a parliament that can proceed
8173059 russias decision today confirms that its invasion of georgia was part of a broader premeditated plan to redraw the map of europe
8173060 the russian federations actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation the nation of georgia
8173061 this is not the end of the story in georgia
8173062 russia wants to aggravate rather than calm down passions this is an extremely alarming development
8173063 end of the epoch of a weak russia and restores a multipolar world order
8173064 russia has no such goals it will be up to south ossetia and abkhazia
8173065 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
8173066 all my life i have been waiting for this moment
8173067 there is a lot of mileage in high quality newspapers
8173068 colour on every page opens up design opportunities that previously didnt exist
8173069 i applaud this i think its a terrific statement and it strengthens the paper version of the globe
8173070 it is good news that housing starts are at the low level where they are and at some point people are going to come out of rental housing and move back into purchased housing
8173071 when theyre restructured i think the u s housing market will become a much more orderly place
8173072 there are a lot of bad memories and its not something that we discuss any more
8173073 management did a decent job of handling the situation so from that standpoint they were able to get their second wind relatively quickly
8173074 when something like that originally happens it has more to do with the psychology of crowds than the fundamentals of companies
8173075 the lesson from pilgrims pride is that if your management team is competent if they engage the public and disclose relevant information as they become aware of it then the stock price can recover to the same level as before the incident
8173076 as a result of this sale which is effective immediately pilgrims pride is no longer a producer of turkey
8173077 the sale will allow pilgrims pride to focus on our long term strategy of building our core chicken business
8173078 the expectation of increased pricing pressure has prompted moodys investors service to change its outlook on the canadian wireless telecommunications sector from positive to stable
8173079 it strikes me as the first independent market corroboration that the policy we pursued in the wireless spectrum auction to bring more choice to consumers is working
8173080 it seems clear from reading the report that the industry will remain stable and healthy but they do say there will be more competition and
8173081 competition in canada has traditionally been less intense than it is in the u s
8173082 the countrys restrictions on foreign ownership of telecom companies has allowed the three similarly sized national operators to pursue profit oriented growth strategies in a protected market that is far less penetrated than the u
8173083 anticipates the recent auction of spectrum will transform the market
8173084 we need to find better ways to prepare our black and hispanic students for college and new ways to engage them in learning
8173085 this begins with guaranteed access to the psat better preparatory courses for the sat and a new look at how high schools are structured to meet the needs of all students
8173086 were certainly seeing the quality of canadian shows increase year over year
8173087 thats reflected in the success many of them are having in securing international broadcasts
8173088 it is a good year and the field is interesting in that it does have the returning favourites but also some new series
8173089 i dont think anybody can ever remember a time where weve had such wild and wide fluctuations in energy prices
8173090 alberta is still leading the nation no matter whether our rate of growth is slightly less than it might be in a couple of the other provinces
8173091 whats most significant about todays announcement is it affords this province the opportunity many do not have and thats to respond to the growing negative side to some of the growth
8173092 we certainly should have enough money to address the needs in health care education and social services
8173093 hopefully it puts to bed zombies who say health care is unsustainable
8173094 obviously im well aware i wasnt the most popular pickup in calgary flames history but at the same time i think you have to give it a little bit of time and give me a chance
8173095 given the chance i think i can prove myself and help this team out
8173096 its very similar to being back in vancouver as far as being recognized on the streets and wherever you go
8173097 everyone has been very respectful and i hope it continues especially when my family is around me myself is a different story but no everyone has been very respectful and nice
8173098 when he came in his son was with him and i thought cool thats where young boys should be in the summer with their dads
8173099 possibly not the best way to encourage drivers to keep their eyes on the road
8173100 signs warning of the possibility theres a chopper overhead are likely to make people look up
8173101 people will think im doing four miles over the speed limit is there a chopper overhead
8173102 in terms of making the roads safer it would be much more productive to put more cops in cars
8173103 all those finger waggers admonishing about what no to do
8173104 the private school girls are straight haired skinny fashonista clones who look like their every mood is accessorized today their lip gloss is in the shade of sad p 35
8173105 i can assure you we take all precautions all rules of engagement are followed we have tremendous confidence and faith in our leadership here in afghanistan
8173106 the enemy which is trying to do things to make a propaganda campaign out of such incidents so nobody benefits
8173107 definitely we ourselves and the international community will exercise maximum caution to prevent such incidents which go against all of our wishes and all of the ideals which we are here fighting for
8173108 prevent the repetition of such incidents which are so unfortunate
8173109 having these eyes in the sky that allow us to locate the taliban to see in some instances where they are making these ieds improvised explosive devices that are having such a horrific effect on the troops and the civilian population
8173110 there is no question that this has been a tough season very difficult sledding for our forces as well as our allies
8173111 it is also our intention that we should not be a burden on our canadian friends and allies or the rest of the international community forever
8173112 wir gehen an den verhandlungstisch mit der klaren erwartungshaltung vom neutralen schlichter ein deutlich verbessertes angebot vorgelegt zu bekommen
8173113 die alters und geschlechtsverteilung bei den skeletten lie allerdings einen milit rischen kontext vermuten
8173114 das risiko weiterer lawinen ist zu gro wir werden nicht das leben der rettungskr fte aufs spiel setzen um die leichen zu bergen
8173115 die gelockt wird von kommerziellen anbietern und pl tzlich stehen die leute vor einem berg und dann merken sie da wollten sie eigentlich auch gar nicht hin
8173116 es gibt immer noch das bed rfnis dar ber zu reden
8173117 auf dem milit rgel nde ist er nur schwer zug nglich
8173118 die mitglieder der gruppe werden immer lter und k nnen nicht mehr alles in eigenregie machen
8173119 deux personnes sont mortes dans le sud est dans leffondrement de leurs maisons une autre est d c d e dans des circonstances non encore lucid es
8173120 aux amis de la coop ration internationale et aux organisations non gouvernementales de travailler ensemble pour aider la gestion des risques et des d sastres
8173121 ich solle mich nicht so haben kann doch mal passieren
8173122 pour linstant il ny a pas de r ponse positive de leur part
8173123 jinsiste sur le fait que pour le moment la police nutilisera pas la force pour disperser les manifestants
8173124 de nombreuses personnes d sireuses de nous rejoindre ont t bloqu es par la police
8173125 pas de d mocratie avec le chaos de la pad
8173126 nous avons de la chance que la situation nait pas encore d g n r
8173127 ne peut accepter ces violations de tout le droit international
8173128 ne peut accepter ces violations de tout le droit international
8173129 nous ne pouvons pas accepter ces violations de tout le droit international des accords de s curit et de coop ration en europe des r solutions des nations unies et la prise pour la premi re fois depuis longtemps dun territoire par une arm e dun pays voisin
8173130 est hors la loi internationale et ce nest pas seulement lopinion de lunion europ enne
8173131 faut il quil y ait une confrontation jesp re que non
8173132 il y a dautres objectifs que lon peut supposer tre les objectifs de la russie en particulier la crim e lukraine la moldavie
8173133 les conflits dans le caucase sont des conflits extr mement durs
8173134 faut il quil y ait une confrontation jesp re que non
8173135 cest la solution politique qui doit tre pr f r e
8173136 prenant en compte les souhaits exprim s librement par les peuples doss tie et dabkhazie et sur la base des principes de la charte des nations unies et dautres documents de droit international
8173137 na pas t prise la l g re ni sans pleine consid ration de ses cons quences
8173138 les forces de maintien de la paix russes ont prot g de lembrasement
8173139 dans les relations internationales on ne peut pas avoir une r gle pour certains et une r gle pour les autres
8173140 condamn fermement cette d cision contraire aux principes dind pendance de souverainet et dint grit territoriale de la g orgie
8173141 appelle de ses voeux une solution politique des conflits en g orgie
8173142 contredit le principe dint grit territoriale un principe fondamental du droit international des peuples
8173143 pour former la coalition la plus large possible contre lagression russe en g orgie
8173144 les v nements daujourdhui pourraient avoir des implications plus larges pour la s curit et la stabilit dans le caucase
8173145 la d cision de la russie est totalement ill gale
8173146 le temps joue pour nous et non pour la russie
8173147 la d cision de la russie est totalement ill gale

8173150 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
8173151 cest peut tre le match le plus important de notre saison

8173154 nous savons que b le a pris trois buts lors de son dernier match mais cest aussi une quipe qui marque des buts jesp re que ce sera bon signe pour nous
8173155 nous avons des bless s mais si les rempla ants font leur travail alors il ny aura pas de probl me
8173156 je ne pense pas que perdre le premier match de la saison va affecter mes joueurs la qualification pour la champions league est une tout autre motivation
8173157 la concentration sera le facteur cl nous devons minimiser nos erreurs
8173158 notre motivation est grande mais je sais que a ne va pas tre facile les turcs sont favoris alors il faudra jouer intelligemment il faudra saisir nos chances les supporteurs vont cr er une ambiance tr s chaude mais je pense que mes joueurs peuvent garder leur calme ce sera un bon test mais je suis optimiste

8173172 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8173173 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8173174 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic
8173175 its going from bright ice to a much darker ocean
8173176 that allows for the breakdown of that by bacteria and other organisms that release co2 or methane depending on how the breakdown occurs
8173177 o empate n o me preocupa nem coloca mais press o equipa todo o mundo viu que o benfica est muito bem melhorou muito n o tivemos sorte na concretiza o mas isso ir gradualmente melhorar

8173188 weve been passing out the rights for 50 years and theyre capitalised in the land
8173189 in some regions if you get land that has access to water its probably worth 5000 to 25 000 hectare extra
8173190 this is nothing new the slope has been pretty slippery for the past 150 years
8173191 this is heading down the track of privatisation of water and creating ownership rights so it can be traded
8173192 the government would not support such a move as we believe water is owned by all new zealanders
8173193 it could overshadow the rights of ordinary people to have a say for example about rivers and streams they wish to swim or fish in and drink from
8173194 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories
8173195 but these risks can be managed by spreading a short portfolio over a number of stocks and implementing stringent stop loss mechanisms both at the stock and portfolio level
8173196 the ability to short smaller market cap stocks is what gives the portfolio efficiency its biggest boost
8173197 it really hasnt made us that much money for several years
8173198 if we raise our gas price to what wed call normal gas pricing what people would pay in other cities around the world i dont know how that would be impacted on the final price down here in perth
8173199 with higher costs of supply already impacting the business there was already significant upward pressure on was industrial gas prices
8173200 as with all businesses woodside must pass on increased cost
8173201 the idea that we can somehow afford this cost into our business is unrealistic
8173202 this unexpected new tax is no different to any other cost
8173203 it will be passed on to customers over the next few months and years as we reopen and renew domestic contracts and well recover as much as we can if not all of the tax burden
8173204 we cant go into a loss mode at that plant where we put it into the pipeline
8173205 we thought it was for the life of the project
8173206 if it was additional revenue that the government wanted we could have sat down and entered into a negotiation and delivered a win win outcome
8173207 for example improved fiscal terms for new projects could create significant tax revenues without imposing additional taxation costs which could have been a better situation and we wouldnt have to pass on such a large cost to customers

8173225 me gust el recibimiento y el calor de la gente para con muchos jugadores como paolo frangipane juan carlos olave eso no s lo le hace bien a ellos sino a nosotros como compa eros la gente aplaudi a todos nos recibieron muy bien y nos fuimos mejor eso nos da confianza para volver a jugar de local y esperar otros buenos resultados
8173226 sabemos que falta mucho la gente es due a de ilusionarse pero nosotros debemos estar tranquilos y sabemos que si mantenemos el orden y la concentraci n todo puede ser pero esto reci n comienza
8173227 estamos felices porque mostramos un nivel futbol stico superlativo esperemos que el lunes podamos manejar la pelota y hacer los goles

8173238 after considering the evidence the committee believed the measure to lift the exemption from an excise on condensate is justified and supports the governments introduction of the relevant legislation

8173240 there was a commitment but there was not a diligent application in the four terms of the beattie government
8173241 weve made more progress in the 12 months of anna bligh than we did in the four terms prior to that
8173242 were making pumping progress now we have a premier and a bureaucracy here in queensland that is steadfastly committed and that is making the changes that are needed
8173243 i watched that last term of the beattie government and you know it was just a story of no progress
8173244 the state was consumed with all sorts of other priorities and it kind of underlined for me how indigenous affairs and the prospects of the most miserable can easily be put off the agenda and youve got to wait three years before you get another chance
8173245 were not going to make progress unless there is a generational commitment across political parties and across elections
8173246 im very hopeful and im very pleased with our present governments progress under anna blighs leadership
8173247 im really quite optimistic about the approach of the frc
8173248 the caseload is going to be very high but over four years were hoping the caseload is going to diminish

8173260 the most important thing is to defend the rights of the people who live in south ossetia and abkhazia

8173266 the economic health of galveston is pretty sturdy but we have a sense that people are more pinched by the cost of food and fuel
8173267 we want people to recognize what it has done in the past to touch the community
8173268 were convinced people will see these good things happening around them and be willing to come back this year to support the campaign
8173269 the computer models are all over the place right now
8173270 its too early to theorize on galveston the potential is there but its too early to narrow down where it might go

8173274 while the martu people have not yet had the opportunity to properly consider uranium mining on their lands we are not opposed to it in principle
8173275 we strongly believe that uranium mining could be an opportunity for our people to generate equity and commercial benefit and importantly play an important part in the development of significant resources projects for this state
8173276 this is an important intergenerational issue for our people and its an issue that martu should be able to consider and make decisions about in an informed manner
8173277 it is especially a means of achieving economic and social outcomes for a group of people who continue to be under serviced by the state government
8173278 we have also been making representations to minister jim mcginty the minister for health in relation to martu health issues and he has not even replied to our requests for a meeting
8173279 its an opportunity we believe has been taken away from us by the premier yesterday

8173285 umno and the bn have not broken new grounds after march 8 they continue to use old tactics in permatang pauh tactics which are no longer applicable in the present situation
8173286 after march 8 things have changed and the changes are not small they hit at the core of the bn and umno and the leaders have not been able to bite the bullet and take real measures to repair the damages theres plenty of talk no action though theres plenty of jostling within the party and this will cost the ruling coalition even more

8173290 he said he is feeling better and is ready to go home
8173291 he was not totally unconscious but it was hurting him he was moving his arms when they took him away on the stretcher
8173292 a witness near him saw what he believed was a spark of electricity between him and the tool he was reaching for
8173293 a few guys saw it but im not sure if it hit him or right beside him
8173294 one of the guys said it hit the top of his head but i didnt see his shoes messed up

8173307 we found that government spending in aggregate has tracked upwards slightly over the past two years
8173308 recent data suggest s that the canadian gross domestic product growth in the second quarter was likely somewhat weaker than the 0 8 per cent growth expected
8173309 theres at least a 50 per cent chance of having a negative number the canadian export numbers are truly awful
8173310 the bottom line is that this speech is consistent with our view that the bank of canada will pass on rate changes next week but is turning somewhat more dovish in a manner that could pave the way for further easing
8173311 we are forecasting a 50 basis point decline in short term interest rates in the fourth quarter of this year
8173312 what weve found so far is merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg

8173336 lost confidence in the fairfax board and its ability to manage the company through these challenging financial times when its only strategy is to cut editorial staff again and again
8173337 management is clearly struggling to deal with how to handle the complex demands of high end quality journalism
8173338 the sydney morning herald and the age need to be agenda setting and relevant to consumer interests to have an influential role in modern societies
8173339 this cannot be achieved by filling the gap between the ads with the kind of cheap as chips copy sharing and pr supplied bumf that mccarthys regional weeklies have been able to get away with

8173346 diversification has always been a great strategy to follow where youre trying to spread your risk and mitigate against having all your eggs in one basket
8173347 thats always been a good strategy and one that weve preached in strong markets and in weaker markets
8173348 were in a volatile market right now and volatility is a normal set of circumstances after we come out of a major bull market which we did about a year ago or so
8173349 theres often some set of circumstances that causes the market to go lower and in this particular case it was the sub prime issue in the united states where people were borrowing beyond their means to buy housing
8173350 when this occurs our analysts take a look at the companies they are following and if the investment thesis remains the same well add to our positions
8173351 investors make more money its been shown historically when theyre buying on lower prices as long as the earnings power of the company is there
8173352 my advice to investors would be to lighten up somewhat take some profits out of the canadian market and most investors who have been in the market for a while have some significant profits to take and diversify themselves elsewhere
8173353 if i take it instead to the eafe index europe australia the far east only 43 per cent of that index is in those sectors
8173354 so if you invest solely in canada then youre bypassing 97 per cent of those opportunities
8173355 while canada has some of the greatest companies in the world i think a lot of investors know that to be case and they bid the prices up

8173365 dat zijn krokodillentranen ook vorige coalitiepartijen werkten samen dat weten de pvda en christenunie als geen ander
8173366 dat we als coalitiepartners samen optrekken is niks bijzonders met zn drie n zijn we een samenwerking voor vier jaar aangegaan dat willen we zo goed mogelijk doen daarom komen we met voorstellen waarvan we denken dat het de juiste richting is voor de gemeente
8173367 dat hebben we voor de zomervakantie duidelijk laten weten het verwerken van idee n het maken van duidelijke voorstellen en het rekenwerk kost tijd maar de oppositie heeft nog ruim de tijd om er iets van te vinden

8173370 his sense of comedy was intelligent bizarre and slapstick with simple narration and direction i have never been an assistant director to anyone but i carefully observed hrishikesh das style of filmmaking his films had substance
8173371 todays comedies dont stand a chance in front of his films i think the closest one to his style was munnabhai m b b s that is the one film in recent times that he would have been very proud of
8173372 when you watch todays comedies you feel that a lot of effort and pain is taken to elicit laughter i dont think that was his approach
8173373 i find it strange when i meet people who are born after golmaal was released and they say they like his mukherjees films and they watch these films over and over again his comedies were free flowing and natural
8173374 i remember him as a warm and caring person i never felt intimidated despite being new on the sets when i was working in golmaal i was a mother of two young daughters he used to tell other senior artistes i will finish her scenes first so that she can go home and be with her children

8173402 it was a lot similar to those games last year very much so
8173403 i think any time somebody pops off i think it catches some fire to it between the media and the fans and our players
8173404 i think our players hear that and they kind of take that to heart they get up and they get more determined and everything thats kind of like fighting words it kind of sets them off
8173405 if you notice we seem like we are in a more business frame of mind so that means we dont particularly want to associate with them i like that ive always liked that i think when we come to the ballpark when i put my uniform on were going to come out here and beat you i dont have any friends on the field when were playing weve got a couple guys like that and i really love that part about them

8173418 die usa verurteilen den beschluss des russischen pr sidenten die georgischen regionen s dossetien und abchasien als unabh ngige regionen anzuerkennen
8173419 dieser beschluss widerspricht mehreren resolutionen des un sicherheitsrats f r die russland bisher gestimmt hat und entspricht auch nicht dem unter vermittlung frankreichs geschlossenen sechs punkte abkommen ber den waffenstillstand das pr sident medwedew am 12 august unterzeichnet hat
8173420 wir erwarten dass russland seine internationalen verpflichtungen einhalten diese unverantwortliche entscheidung revidieren und sich an die positionen halten wird die vom sechs punkte abkommen festgelegt wurden
8173421 der schritt russlands versch rft die spannungen und erschwert diplomatische verhandlungen

8173425 we are investigating a matter which relates to a police officer and were still investigating
8173426 we had concerns about his behaviour and weve then looked to investigate that matter
8173427 so at the moment were still collecting evidence and well talk with the director of public prosecutions about the way we might go forward
8173428 were not about to investigate matters that are frivolous or dont have substance to them
8173429 what people need to understand is that police officers do have discretion many officers exercise that discretion in a number of ways
8173430 what we require of our officers when they do that though is that they are open and transparent
8173431 we have a variety of ways we conduct investigations were comfortable with the way we are investigating that
8173432 theres a whole variety of ways we find out about officers behaving badly our ethical standards department does an outstanding job

8173506 his name and what he achieved its so far out of any players reach in his time or any player who has played since its almost like he played a different game to what were playing
8173507 is there anyone whos ever played any sport whos been able to achieve that level of greatness
8173508 he was a quiet taciturn recessive hero who avoided parties and went back to his hotel room and wrote his newspaper column every night and a daily letter to his wife jessie
8173509 in australian parlance he was the tall poppy that was never felled no one ever felt the need to bring him down
8173510 he is our clark kent the mild mannered ordinary man who contains and conceals immeasurable powers is always there when needed and always delivers the goods but with nobility of purpose
8173511 vor 500 jahren wurde amerika entdeckt aber die gemeinsame europ ische identit t kennen wir noch nicht

8173524 goddard was ahead of the curve transforming individuals and their respective communities by expanding the realm of knowledge based on the fundamental principles of democracy
8173525 it seems to me that mumia has achieved the kind of integration of body mind and spirit that we strive for within this program and that each graduate today has achieved in some measure in their work
8173526 one of the finest and most unique colleges in the country
8173527 you leave goddard at a time when the nation and the world faces serious challenges as do indeed you all what the nation needs and indeed what the world needs as well is new clear thinking about the challenges facing us
8173528 but as goddard grads you are all fully equipped with the ability to think a faculty i might add not much in evidence in our national political life im afraid but this ability when used critically and flexibly may yet result in finding sane humane solutions to our problems
8173529 i was inspired by mumias speech his voice and words invoked a renewed commitment to truth and compassion a commitment i need to practice every day as a graduate with the privilege of a higher education he reminded me of my new roles of teacher leader and an open minded thinker
8173530 if you can run bio fuels successfully in the most harsh and extreme environment in the world then there is no reason why you cant use them to get to the supermarket
8173531 while the effects of urbanization are very localized cumulatively it is a big threat to biodiversity
8173532 our urban footprint covers much of the globe and is coming closer to stomping out many endangered species and posing new risks to protected areas and parks
8173533 as a species we have lived in wild nature for hundreds of thousands of years and now suddenly most of us live in cities the ultimate escape from nature
8173534 if we do not learn to build expand and design our cities with a respect for nature we will have no nature left anywhere
8173535 this is yet another vivid example of why conservation cannot simply be about sequestering nature in parks and reserves
8173536 we can set up all the reserves we want but if we do not take care in where we place our cities how we grow our cities and how we live in our cities then we will fail in our mission to protect biodiversity
8173537 governments city planners and conservationists can work together to predict and plan in advance for some of these threats to nature
8173538 some species just have the bad luck of living where cities have been built but by knowing our impact to these endangered species and protected areas planners can start to shape the growth of cities to be more environmentally friendly
8173539 only by addressing this growing conflict between cities and biodiversity can society achieve genuine conservation in an urbanizing world

8173676 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
8173677 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
8173678 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
8173679 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
8173680 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president

8173684 there must be a republican gremlin in the sound system
8173685 this is an issue of equality and justice this is a family issue

8173691 and after so many decades 88 years ago on this very day the 19th amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote would be forever enshrined in our constitution my mother was born before women could vote but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president this is the story of america of women and men who defy the odds and never give up how do we give this country back to them by following the example of a brave new yorker a woman who risked her life to shepherd slaves along the underground railroad and on that path to freedom harriet tubman had one piece of advice if you hear the dogs keep going if you see the torches in the woods keep going if theyre shouting after you keep going dont ever stop keep going if you want a taste of freedom keep going

8173708 whats the format id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie
8173709 imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8173710 everyone in the locker room feels that even the defensive guys are excited about what were doing on the offensive side of the ball
8173711 i think guys are really understanding the opportunity we have this year as far as making big plays
8173712 you cant be a guy who thinks that the ball isnt coming to you on this play you have to finish every route
8173713 last year it would take a whole half just to get past the 50 yard line
8173714 it is very early but when you compare it to where weve been in the past i like the improvement
8173715 actually he wasnt throwing as hard as he usually does
8173716 he just had exceptional command he was able to flip that curve up there anytime he wanted to he pitched like one of the better pitchers in baseball and he is
8173717 were about giving all types of players a place to play and compete
8173718 it was a formality when someone shoots that far under their handicap im obligated to let the ncga know about it
8173719 a lot of them arent signed some of them are i told these guys to give me a chance lets see what i can do
8173720 people are thinking that i hit every shot down the middle that i hit every green it didnt happen that way
8173721 did i hit some good shots yes did i have some luck yes
8173722 women are more honest than men and thats the truth
8173723 he was his own worst enemy getting behind and walking some guys
8173724 particularly to left handed hitters tonight he had trouble throwing strikes he has to trust his stuff and work ahead better
8173725 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8173726 it is prudent for the governor general to remain in canada
8173727 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility

8173732 the act folks have done a wonderful job of marketing their product to the mid atlantic colleges

8173738 israel is more conflicted and complicated than it may seem

8173747 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
8173748 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
8173749 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together

8173778 oh my god this would be perfect for him her
8173779 why cant i be rich and lead a life of leisure eating light lunches and drinking beers at a sunny table outside every day

8173808 i dont want to fight i dont want to shout
8173809 i wish i could play normal matches and enjoy tennis sometimes
8173810 not getting a break from that high pressure environment can lead to burnout
8173811 theres been a big shift in philosophy theres much more year round hockey taking place
8173812 that certainly lends itself to kids dropping out of the game earlier than historically they would have they might be getting a lifetimes worth of hockey in a shorter period of time
8173813 its never been my favourite thing to do in the world
8173814 were a hockey family so its definitely not a good thing to tell your dad youre quitting hockey
8173815 the bars been raised but it hasnt its been accelerated
8173816 the kids with the most potential are still the kids with the most potential some kids are getting to their peak at a very quick pace a lot of parents dont understand this
8173817 some of the data we have shows they spent a lot more time playing at their sport in an unorganized way
8173818 we see a lot of kids who play the same way
8173819 were getting into structure so early were sucking the life out of the game in a lot of ways
8173820 were getting them on the elite treadmill too soon and were setting them up for disappointment
8173821 its been an up and down career so far and this is one of the ups
8173822 i think that in a couple of years well be a team to watch for
8173823 i think thats the most over rated part of my game
8173824 i think that when i do fight i do well but thats not what i try to go out and do
8173825 if a guy is going to challenge me or take liberties with my teammates then ill do it the game i want to play is to be a skilled power forward i want to be able to bang and crash but not too much so that it takes away from my skill level
8173826 verbieten sie doch bitte ihrem sohn mir st ndig mit dem einkaufswagen in die f e zu fahren das tut mir weh

8173828 theyve run a model franchise and i think everyone in pittsburgh recognizes how proud they are of the steelers and we in the nfl recognize how fortunate we have been to have dan rooneys leadership and now arts leadership
8173829 that is certainly a consideration the ownership of other clubs wants to make sure this team is going to be run consistently with those principles and if dan rooney wants an opportunity to continue to run the franchise i think thats an interest that some of the owners have
8173830 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8173831 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8173832 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8173833 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8173834 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8173835 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8173836 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8173837 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8173838 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8173839 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8173840 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8173841 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8173842 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8173843 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8173844 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8173845 i prepared the same way last year i did this year i go in preparing as if im the guy whether hes here or not who knows what the situation will be
8173846 if im struggling hell help me and if hes struggling ill help him out its give and take
8173847 hes the hec crighton winner im not trying to be erik glavic
8173848 but this is an opportunity for me to show coach steve sumarah and this team that i can lead i want to make it hard on coach sumarah so that when erik is back he knows he can use me as well
8173849 at the beginning of my career at saint marys i was kind of a timid guy ive definitely grown a lot and that experience has helped me a lot to gain confidence that i can be a cis starting quarterback
8173850 im very pleased with the depth we have at quarterback its even more than i anticipated
8173851 but right now ted would have to be considered the main horse
8173852 when erik glavic says erik glavic is ready well more forward from there
8173853 if i had to tilt one way or the other like an airplane id tilt that way
8173854 i would assume that hell probably say no and if thats the case so be it
8173855 well be ok i dont know if three or six plays although i would like to do that i dont know what you get out of that really
8173856 it would be safe to say that im leaning toward that
8173857 the most important thing to me is us getting ready as a group and getting ready for miami
8173858 the more work he does with our guys in the group the better
8173859 its the last pre season game and you want to go out and have a good showing but you want to do that whether its the first pre season game or the last
8173860 obviously you want to leave a taste not only in the fans mouths but also for your teammates and coaches as well
8173861 if we can get him over in good time then i have no doubt that he would be involved on sunday at some stage
8173862 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
8173863 i think we were all there for each other tonight there were 10 men behind me we all just really dug in and gave it our all and theres the result
8173864 we hadnt scored that many goals against them all year and we hadnt scored first against them
8173865 last year it sucked to lose so its nice to win again
8173866 i am of a strong belief that yes we need to learn to communicate
8173867 but whether or not you can communicate shouldnt determine whether or not you have a card on the lpga tour
8173868 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8173869 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8173870 the players that are playing the best are international players and their play alone should help raise the level of the tour which it is
8173871 theres a group of younger players who all they want to do is play golf
8173872 to show emotion and be engaging they think it may affect their psyche we know that thats just not the case
8173873 it cant be that way to continue to sell our product
8173874 i think there was probably a bit of a lost opportunity for her as our champion to interact with the sponsors and fans
8173875 you lose a little bit of the human element when youre using a translator
8173876 there is a communication barrier with some players during the pro am
8173877 but you also get some korean players for example who do a great job even with the limited english that they may have theyre still entertaining they still show everybody a good time
8173878 the tournament owners are struggling to find new sponsors were struggling to find new tournaments
8173879 when you look back historically torontos been a graveyard for young defencemen that maybe shouldnt have been integrated into the nhl lineup as early as they were
8173880 when you look at your top two lines were going to have a lot of young players there this year
8173881 how we fare during the regular season will depend very much on how half a dozen of our young players progress
8173882 were not going to be able to start finding that out until we drop the puck for real
8173883 the key word for the maple leafs management and coaching is going to be patience
8173884 you cant force things to happen you have to let them unfold and happen at their own pace
8173885 we will be patient we will give a lot of young players that opportunity to become better players and to become a good hockey team
8173886 this is a significant step for me to get back out on the practice field
8173887 if things go well as we expect they will then i hope to be full go next week and ready for the season opener
8173888 were going to monitor him and rookie tight end tom santi who will start practising today
8173889 so we do have a pitch count on those guys
8173890 in terms of the game of bridge itself computers cant play at any reasonable level
8173891 even i can probably beat the best bridge software that exists today
8173892 here you cant go five or 10 games without a point without anyone noticing and there you can go under the radar a little bit
8173893 thats one thing that i think is going to benefit not just myself but this team i think you are under the gun here and under the pressure of having to perform
8173894 obviously im well aware i wasnt the most popular pickup in calgary flame history but at the same time i think youve got to give it a little time and give me a chance
8173895 i cant lie to you its not the jersey i thought i was going to wear but at the same time i played enough games here to know what kind of fan base and what kind of team they are
8173896 in anaheim i thought it was going to be a good opportunity but i just didnt fit into the mode there with ice time playing 10 to 12 minutes a game its kind of hard to perform
8173897 we were over there and they were taking pictures and the only time ive seen this was in l a when we got on a red carpet once in a while not at the rink
8173898 i said to todd does this remind you of vancouver a little bit he said yeah here we go again
8173899 i havent played a home game on canadian soil since i was 16 years old so i think the whole idea of canadians knowledge of the game their love their passion for the sport is how i grew up
8173900 in order to maximize our economy weve got to deal with this deficit of the government of guam if our government is financially sick it will have a negative impact in our economy and the economic opportunity of this community
8173901 my honest opinion is that they could care less about the students because if they really cared about the students this would not happen i suggest they better wake up and not wait until anyone gets hurt
8173902 in 1992 watching tv the liberation day parade the commentator was going down the street asking all these people what they thought of liberation day 15 20 people everything was about party family reunions barbeque over night no school not one person said anything about why we celebrate liberation day and i really thought that was a sad travesty
8173903 sort of like elite forces special training that do these special ops and the marine corps commandant at the time disbanded the units because they felt that all marines should be the same during the course of their existence they all had special knives made they were numbered and two of these knives were found on guam
8173904 the bottom line is that as old as these homes are they are illegal non conforming they are not in compliance with a lot of the building codes
8173905 they were clearly allowed to stay there as emergency temporary housing anywhere from 90 days to no more than a year
8173906 some had contracts some did not some were contracts that were not signed some contracts were signed by the then superintendent of education the attorney general and the governor some were signed by the director of administration the attorney general and the governor and in dpws case i never signed any of those contracts so it wasnt signed by the attorney general the governor or myself but it was signed by other persons
8173907 we have to get them out of there if that building collapses on them and someone gets hurt thats a major government liability
8173908 the negotiations between the libyan negotiator and the hijacker have started
8173909 im really not good at the whole menu planning and shopping accordingly i really wish i was so we
8173910 jason giambi hit a home run off ryan franklin tonight how do you count that do we wipe that off the records or are home runs hit by a steroid hitter good if they come off a steroid pitcher

8173926 most people are expecting obama to be knocked off within a couple of years so its only fair that we tell them who the next vice president will be
8173927 out of respect for the late president obama i think we choose another black guy what about samuel l jackson no hang on chris rock
8173928 it should be a woman then wed have one of each
8173929 what about jennifer aniston or maybe glenn close she played the vice president in air force one or was that geena davis not it was definitely glenn close then again she was a bit of wimp okay scratch that lets go with sigourney weaver

8173938 i was very curious to know who was the hero of this film my father did not answer many of my questions in this regard but when my father revealed to me that i would be the lead actor in the film just when the film unit was leaving to srinagar to shoot the songs and i was really flabbergasted at that moment but then while participating in the shooting i was conscious that a big responsibility has been placed on me i just followed the instructions of the director dance director of the film i was guided by instructions of senior technicians in the film and i was also encouraged by my co artistes

8173981 there was a commitment but there was not a diligent application in the four terms of the beattie government
8173982 weve made more progress in the 12 months of anna bligh than we did in the four terms prior to that
8173983 were making pumping progress now we have a premier and a bureaucracy here in queensland that is steadfastly committed and that is making the changes that are needed
8173984 i watched that last term of the beattie government and you know it was just a story of no progress
8173985 the state was consumed with all sorts of other priorities and it kind of underlined for me how indigenous affairs and the prospects of the most miserable can easily be put off the agenda and youve got to wait three years before you get another chance
8173986 were not going to make progress unless there is a generational commitment across political parties and across elections

8173993 after considering the evidence the committee believed the measure to lift the exemption from an excise on condensate is justified and supports the governments introduction of the relevant legislation

8174019 the 52 week results underline that vegf trap eye has the potential to significantlyreduce retinal thickness and improve vision
8174020 the further development of this compound is important for millions of people worldwide who suffer from this devastating ocular disease
8174021 based upon retinal physicians feedback there remains a significant unmet medical need for a treatment for wet amd that can reliably improve visual acuity over time without the need for monthly intravitreal injections
8174022 we are excited about these study findings and the potential for vegf trap eye to fulfill this need pending the results of our ongoing phase 3 clinical studies
8174023 nexavar is the only systemic therapy with proven efficacy and tolerability in hcc across multiple patient populations
8174024 liver cancer is the third largest global cause of cancer related deaths worldwide and there is a significant need for new therapies that can be used at all stages in the course of the disease to delay progression and prolong life
8174025 i was immensely relieved when the doctors and nurses explained to me and my wife that rapidarc treatments focus just on the tumor
8174026 earlier technology for radiotherapy limited the number of angles we could use for striking at a tumor
8174027 with rapidarc technology we are seeing excellent treatment plans that permit us to target the tumor from nearly every angle in a 360 degree circle around the patient the impressive thing is that when we use rapidarc to target the tumor from more angles we can deliver a treatment using less radiation and it only takes two minutes
8174028 the vast majority of our patients since then have had no complications following treatment
8174029 i couldnt imagine how we would improve on that but with rapidarc we have we can get the same results two to eight times faster than was possible with our earlier technology
8174030 whereas we generally treated four patients each hour rapidarc is making it possible for us to treat up to five patients an hour with plenty of time in between appointments having extra time for administrative tasks will help us ensure that charges are captured correctly and cut back on time consuming billing errors
8174031 ive been pleased with the thoughtful and efficient care ive been getting at image guided radiation therapy
8174032 im in the treatment room for only about five minutes per session because i live so close to the care center im only away from home about an hour each day the doctors told me that i was one of the very first patients in the northeast to receive treatments using this technology i think its wonderful that people are inventing these devices its a miracle as far as im concerned
8174033 these abnormal features of tumor vessels impair delivery of circulating chemotherapeutic drugs to the actual tumor site
8174034 because high cell density increases contractility across the entire cell layer these findings suggested that tumor capillary cells are inherently hyper contractile
8174035 in this study weve uncovered a previously unrecognized role for tumor capillary cell mechanosensing and contractility in the formation of irregular tumor vessels and have identified potential new targets for vascular normalization therapy that might be implemented in the clinic someday
8174036 this is a landmark event in the evolution of focused ultrasound surgery
8174037 although there has been significant work done around the world in the field for a number of years it isnt until you see it all come together like this that you begin to understand the true potential of this technology to meet the challenges of modern medicine with less invasive and more effective treatment
8174038 mrgfus 2008 will highlight both current and potential future uses of mrgfus and will provide the most comprehensive and authoritative update of this highly promising technology this will help physicians realize the potential of mrgfus in mainstream medicine this meeting will be a great opportunity for the whole field to work together to accelerate the pace of development and collaboration for mrgfus
8174039 mrgfus 2008 will be extremely helpful to the field to date researchers using and developing mr guidance of focused ultrasound have had to meet a various other meetings be those in the field of mri or therapeutic ultrasound having a unified meeting will allow for all the newest information and development in this combined research field to be shared in the most efficient manner for us mrgfus is an extremely important technology we are presently developing new applications for therapeutic ultrasound that will take advantage of all the benefits that an mr guided system has over other systems including those for treatment planning optimization and validation of therapy our ambitious goals for these applications would not be technically feasible without an mr guided system

8174131 la principale causa va individuata non solo nel minor esercizio fisico ma anche nel consumo di cibi grassi e ricchi di zucchero come le bibite gassate e per questo occorre intervenire nelle case e nelle scuole con una maggiore attenzione ai menu anche a quelli delle mense dove deve essere garantita la presenza di cibi sani come i prodotti tradizionali e la frutta e verdura locale che troppo spesso mancano dalle tavole delle giovani generazioni i ragazzi di questa generazione per la prima volta nella storia potrebbero essere sottolinea la coldiretti i primi ad avere una vita pi breve dei propri genitori proprio per colpa delle malattie causate dallobesit e dal soprappeso secondo lallarme lanciato dal congresso internazionale sullobesit di sidney in australia le malattie collegate direttamente allobesit sono responsabili precisa di ben il 7 per cento dei costi sanitari dellunione europea poich laumento di peso un importante fattore di rischio per molte malattie come i problemi cardiocircolatori il diabete lipertensione linfarto e certi tipi di cancro sulla base dei dati ue

8174183 barangsiapa mendekatkan diri kepada allah dengan suatu pekerjaan kebajikan di dalamnya samalah dia dengan orang yang menunaikan suatu fardhu di dalam bulan yang lain
8174184 ramadhan itu adalah bulan sabar sedangkan sabar itu adalah pahalanya surga ramadhan itu adalah bulan memberi pertolongan syahrul muwasah dan bulan allah memberikan rizqi kepada mukmin di dalamnya

8174207 we would say amcor is in conspiracy with the accc
8174208 allegations of that kind are rejected by my client in the strongest possible terms
8174209 weve unwound all gains since january so after such a fierce move i think technically it suggests the aussie may be due for a bit of consolidation
8174210 theres a long way to go on the us housing correction theres still a huge overhang of inventory and the sales that we are seeing are being generated on much lower prices
8174211 the interest rate differentials are certainly when you look in the big scheme of things are not going to move in the aussies favour anytime soon
8174212 there was no fundamental catalyst for any of it price movement
8174213 it was one of those days that you do not want to read too much into of two or three ticks action on low volumes
8174214 construction work done data was much weaker than expected but it was not a major catalyst for the price action

8174217 us treasuries are responding more to a flight to quality type concerns at the moment the credit kind of things
8174218 they are starting to drop their inflation concerns and focus more on the growth

8174223 bad management must be sanctioned a rescue is justified only when there is a threat to the entire financial system
8174224 there was a commitment but there was not a diligent application in the four terms of the beattie government
8174225 weve made more progress in the 12 months of anna bligh than we did in the four terms prior to that
8174226 were making pumping progress now we have a premier and a bureaucracy here in queensland that is steadfastly committed and that is making the changes that are needed
8174227 i watched that last term of the beattie government and you know it was just a story of no progress
8174228 the state was consumed with all sorts of other priorities and it kind of underlined for me how indigenous affairs and the prospects of the most miserable can easily be put off the agenda and youve got to wait three years before you get another chance
8174229 were not going to make progress unless there is a generational commitment across political parties and across elections

8174244 after considering the evidence the committee believed the measure to lift the exemption from an excise on condensate is justified and supports the governments introduction of the relevant legislation

8174266 we know from studies of both animals and humans that at least three factors can make a huge difference in how the body responds to a given stressor whether there is any and whether the human or animal thinks they have any emerge as modulating factors again and again in research studies of stress
8174267 the scenario of predictability has been studied in army rangers training at jump school to become paratroopers at the start of the training the soldiers underwent enormous increases in cortisol levels during each jump but by the end of the course their stress responses were virtually nonexistent by making the stressor more predictable the stress response of each soldier was controlled to a much greater degree though skydiving will probably never become a completely stress free activity

8174276 it was a woman a psychiatric social worker named sarah haley in the big va outpatient clinic in boston whose research into veterans stress disorder literally blew the existing psychiatric definitions to pieces and began to put a whole new definition on the map
8174277 sarah haley initially seemed the least likely person in the world to make waves
8174278 one day a young man in a highly agitated state was brought into the clinic by his parents
8174279 indeed any other intake worker might have dismissed this recent vietnam veteran as delusional but haley had reason to believe him
8174280 haley had nothing to go on but a big hunch but she decided to follow it
8174281 she further realized that the stuff was eating away at them would have to be brought slowly and steadily to the surface that there were no quick fixes like 5 mg stelazine daily
8174282 most of the vietnam veterans haley found were coming in to see a va psychiatrist merely so that they could get their next months supply of valium
8174283 during those first few years at the va haley encountered a great many vets who talked about participation in atrocities
8174284 doc i think im a murderer i slaughtered innocent civilians
8174285 working with these men and the material they brought up was so painful that it took haley almost two years to complete her article which was immediately recognized as a landmark work by precise delineation of the symptoms of several veterans she had treated haley established that the vietnam veteran who had witnessed or taken part in atrocities could not be handled merely as a traditional case of traumatic war neurosis but presented a completely new challenge to psychotherapy

8174291 he was not totally unconscious but it was hurting him he was moving his arms when they took him away on the stretcher
8174292 a witness near him saw what he believed was a spark of electricity between him and the tool he was reaching for
8174293 a few guys saw it but im not sure if it hit him or right beside him
8174294 one of the guys said it hit the top of his head but i didnt see his shoes messed up

8174322 if as a nation we are serious about lifting overall student performance and addressing underperformance and underachievement what we would have seen today is a statement of certainty from the prime minister
8174323 the loss of 1000 teaching positions would put upward pressure on class sizes and see the collapse of educational programs as a nation we cannot afford that
8174324 in a broad sense i think ways of rewarding high performance are welcome but the devil is in the detail mr mcalpine said
8174325 so long as its done in a way that reflects the genuine complexity and context of schools and the challenges of both leadership and teaching then i think it will be good thing
8174326 make a real difference but questioned where the funding would come from
8174327 i think it would be much better if the federal government could make direct funding to schools of an average of half a million dollars each and that funding be used to improve the learning in the school rather than the state governments having to meet the federal governments commitments he said
8174328 we are really concerned that this government is really not talking to the people it needs to talk to before its making decisions about whats best for australia she said
8174329 hes stating he knows what parents want well were not sure how hes actually engaged with the parents of state schools when he hasnt run this past the national body

8174352 he used to sit with his little guitar and amp and play in the chart room
8174353 as he got more popular people would be knocking on the door with a six pack of beer in their hands wanting to play music with him
8174354 most of the time they hit my door because it was on the front
8174355 i wasnt sure i wanted to make a job out of something that was a sanity break that i really loved
8174356 if i made it a job would it be as enjoyable and fun

8174365 if you look at the speakers the vast majority come from the 18 battleground states
8174366 these conventions are about trying to get swing states to move and winning on nov 4 theres nothing else at stake here zero
8174367 look at the seating arrangements on the convention floor same thing its not that complicated its not about individuals its about winning the key states thats what all of us want
8174368 i think its an important foundation state new jersey new york california these are the places that need to be strong
8174369 our basic obligation is to do our jobs to make sure barack doesnt have any problems in our state
8174370 i think the only lingering element of disunity is that the republicans are trying to take a fairly small slice of disappointment and turn it into a major issue
8174371 thats not been our concern our concern has been a tendency for longer amortization periods like 40 years and for purchasers putting very little money down weve seen nothing in canada like the u s subprime situation

8174376 im honored to stand before you tonight as gov caseys son and a proud supporter of barack obama
8174377 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion
8174378 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8174379 because as pennsylvanians know joe biden is one of us and barack obama is one of us too
8174380 and if you look past the speeches to his record its clear john mccain has never believed in renewable energy and he wont make it part of americas future
8174381 its clear the only thing green in john mccains energy plan is the billions of dollars hes promising in tax cuts for the oil companies and the only thing hell recycle is the same failed bush approach to energy policy
8174382 we have made very clear that we were awaiting a verification mechanism that could assure the accuracy of the statements that north korea made in its declaration
8174383 we actually are in discussions with the north koreans and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
8174384 the u s is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search
8174385 what is going on here is one of two possibilities either they have not been bargaining in good faith and have no intention of giving up their nuclear weapons or they are just trying to negotiate the best bargain they can
8174386 they are not in any rush to expedite the process
8174387 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8174388 failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8174389 barack obama has called for strong american leadership and renewing strong alliances to finish the fight against al qaeda and press russia to live up to its obligations
8174390 now i missed a few years of the cold war as a guest of one of our adversaries
8174391 but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but rather because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8174392 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8174393 if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8174394 2008 will be a very good year as good as last year and perhaps even better
8174395 i didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
8174396 the only reason i came by is to tell you that i love you
8174397 this is the first time ive ever had security senators dont matter
8174398 the only reason i accepted the nomination so the delaware delegation could be moved up front
8174399 that doesnt mean the issue is any less important doesnt mean were on the right track
8174400 we have a much weaker economy than a year ago much higher inflation very unlikely that this trend will continue into 2008
8174401 in face of crisis different states are doing the best they can to come up with band aid solutions
8174402 is this fact the majority of those people without insurance are employed
8174403 whether its 47 million or 45 million uninsured americans thats not an acceptable number
8174404 i realize as difficult times continue you may see people dropping coverage as they lose jobs or employers cut back
8174405 were just as concerned with keeping costs down for those who have coverage as with getting the 45 million into coverage
8174406 although housing prices on a year over year comparison continue to show single digit percentage increases we are beginning to see more price reductions in properties listed on the market today
8174407 homes priced at a competitive level continue to sell quickly but it is important for people to accurately identify their homes value when putting it on the market
8174408 today i was so happy to get a job at last to feed my wife and two kids
8174409 i used to work as a day laborer in construction but theres no construction in the area and its hard to find work
8174410 we will not abandon our work if we do so we will abandon our honor as well because al qaeda would take full control over our area
8174411 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8174412 and whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8174413 it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8174414 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8174415 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8174416 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever because he thinks americans overall are better off thanks to president bush
8174417 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home
8174418 well in john mccains version theres no place like home and a home and home and home
8174419 over the last eight years your lives are less secure those are the facts and john mccain is not promising to do anything different than george bush did
8174420 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8174421 weve got to start smacking back in short understandable bites
8174422 everybody is nervous as all get out everybody says we ought to be ahead by 10 15 points what the heck is going on
8174423 not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8174424 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8174425 and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8174426 not ready 08 a mile high and an inch deep
8174427 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president of the united states of america

8174462 i would love to be there in london but it may well become untenable who knows
8174463 the support that we got from australia was incredible the messages of support to all the athletes were unbelievable
8174464 i want to win i remember the last time we went there i only played half a team because we had a monday league game against newcastle
8174465 when i saw lazio celebrating at the end it was like they had won the world cup i was not too pleased i thought that will not happen again
8174466 i grew up here so ive been seeing fringe shows forever so its a big deal to be a part of it

8174471 i cant guarantee its for everybody id definitely say dont bring the kids
8174472 we would have loved to do a bigger more expensive production with a budget we applied for all the grants we could apply for but despite all the accolades and awards it didnt happen were going back to square one to do it again with 50 cents and a roll of tape
8174473 its giving us an opportunity to stage it that is what the fringe is great for
8174474 there has been a lot of interest and talk from different parties about developing it as a feature film or tv series and there are a few people interested but they really need to see it
8174475 in my view if don bradman was playing today he would still have an average as twice as good as any other batsman in the world
8174476 with the advances in bat technology and training imagine how good don would be today it would be scary he is by far and away the best batsman ever and would still be today

8174483 it was a tough day said singh who went head to head with garcia when sutherland was eliminated on the first hole
8174484 it wasnt easy to get close to the hole so birdie was difficult to come by it was drying out really really a lot and youve got to play almost conservative on some holes
8174485 it was a tough day but it was a great playoff though i enjoyed that
8174486 i think through the past weeks and months and years with the media talking about my putting and writing about my putting and people talking about my putting and people want to help me i must have had hundreds of letters and phone calls and all saying that they can fix my putting said singh who is now 8 4 in playoffs
8174487 you know at the end of the day it kind of gets to your head that youre not a good putter
8174488 so i made a point after last week that you know im going to change that attitude and i believed in myself that im the best putter and i came out here with a different attitude and i putted great this week if i keep doing this im going to win a lot more golf tournaments
8174489 i thought that was one of the worst greens ive ever putted on if you have a mindset on seeded greens that big and that ugly we should never play it really im sure padraig harrington who won the pga championship loves the greens but he played well
8174490 you should never be rewarded for bad shots and those greens were kind of like that
8174491 i played really well and just nothing happened he said
8174492 so again the greens were huge so it was a putting event there and every hole had obs left and right and i dont like that
8174493 this tops westchester every single player out there absolutely enjoyed this golf course tee to green its great and on the greens
8174494 my trainer walked on wednesday and he came across that fifth green and said
8174495 definitely everybody thats playing the fedexcup wants to win said singh whos won 33 pga tour events in his career including three majors
8174496 i mean i want to win as much as anybody else but that doesnt prove that im going to win it i have to go out there and do it thats what im looking forward to
8174497 ive got a great start and i just have to go ahead and play hard for the next three other events the guys behind me the way the system works now the next guy that wins can just overtake you its going to be tough but im ahead and ive got a head start so i just have to go out there and play consistent solid golf and hopefully win at the end
8174498 being part of a bowling unit it does not really matter who takes the wickets we have also got the knowledge and experience of andrew flintoff and steve harmison and they are always passing it on
8174499 we are all bowling for each other and the fielding has been fantastic which only gives the bowlers confidence hopefully we can seal the series on friday
8174500 we are doing everything well at the moment we are turning up on time turning up on form and hammering the training sessions the recipe for success is hard work and the boys are doing the simple things better than the other team but i am not going to go overboard we have not won the series yet
8174501 we can only apologise for a very poor performance people were rightly angry that they did not get a proper game
8174502 it is difficult to put a finger on what went wrong we have a number of injuries but that is no excuse we were just not good enough on the field
8174503 we have got to pick ourselves up and make sure our next performance is a lot better
8174504 my office has given a directive to all development officers around fiji to organize weekly fitness training and conduct lectures for referees
8174505 this started two weeks ago and the response was overwhelming we have also organized a seminar on september 13 14 in suva those who fail to turn up for weekly training in their respective zones and the seminar up will not be considered for the courts homecentres idc
8174506 there is always pressure on referees officiating big games and people should realize that referees are also human i admit that they make blunders but manhandling and abuse does not help anyone
8174507 we have match commissioners present at matches to judge the performance of referees and assistant referees if they find any referee making a wrong decision then we will address that seriously
8174508 we sent an assistant referee home after he awarded an off side goal in the suva rewa match during the fiji fact this year and we will come down hard against any referee that under performs or does not do justice to his job
8174509 we kept it nice and tight we got that early goal everything was going perfectly but there was going to be some stage when we had to push forward and get that second goal
8174510 unfortunately they caught us on the break there and punished us back to 1 1
8174511 our commitment is to assist in the education of players and officials on the path of a professional player and how to uphold professionalism
8174512 in light of the growing popularity of the o league and the rise of professional players in the competition ofc needed a mechanism to help look after its players this mou will help to provide minimum standards for professional players across the region
8174513 on 2 november 2006 fifa and fifpro signed an mou and this was swiftly followed by uefa and fifpros european division signing a somewhat similar document in october last year and now it is the turn of fifpro division asia oceania to do so
8174514 this mou clearly shows that the ofc understands that players are an important stakeholder in the game and that for the game to prosper it is essential to integrate them into the development process
8174515 were looking forward to sending our youth squad to the oceania championship and to have experience players like ofa and brittany is a big bonus for us
8174516 both players have played at the olympic qualifier and they have toured with the national side in regional tournaments their experience is something we need in the team the sprite light league has also played an instrumental role in the selection of players and now the focus is developing the talents for international exposure
8174517 the girls are working on some basic drills as they have gone through their court work and fitness and i believe that the challenge now is to build more confidence to take down the big teams
8174518 i believe we have a strong squad and i believe in the players i have instead of always looking at who might be coming in
8174519 it is up to us as a team to show personality strength and belief within the squad that will make the difference
8174520 we just look at the right player and if we can get him we get him if we dont we dont
8174521 if nothing is done it will not limit our ambitions because of it
8174522 we have talked about everything needed to be successful in a team and commitment is needed for any success no matter how much quality you have
8174523 we live in a world now where you have to accept the critics and a definite conclusion from everybody
8174524 but i know my squad is good my team is good our spirit is good
8174525 we are intelligent enough to know we did not play well on saturday but we know as well we have the needed quality to respond
8174526 we completely understand the critics because we were not good but we promise we will come back and play well tomorrow to put a good performance in
8174527 we have done the job well at twente but the job is not over
8174528 we have to respect twente and come into the game with a desire to win
8174529 it is not always easy to go into a match when you lead 2 0 but i want us to be positive and to win it
8174530 senderos has gone to milan and will complete a medical
8174531 at the moment he does not get the games here and so now he can play somewhere and remains in a top level club
8174532 we have johan djourou we have kolo toure we have senderos we have alex song william gallas and mikael silvestre now who can play centre back so we have a congestion there
8174533 this is not on and i am calling on fiji fa to take the matter seriously as the labasa president has just made a mockery of himself and has burdened the parent body which had to borne costs to set up the committee to look into claims said sharma
8174534 i have full faith in the enquiry team and am anxiously awaiting its outcome which somewhat seems to be taking a lot of time to be released
8174535 if they did not have enough or no evidence at all then why did they come up with such cheap and nonsense allegations
8174536 i will wait for the outcome of the committee and see what fiji fa does on the issue before going to the courts to seek justice as i my players and officials have gone through a lot in the past two months
8174537 i had even received death threats and had to go through a lot of trauma and if justice is not done to me by the committee and fiji fa then the long arms of law will definitely be used to bring the issue to rest for once and all
8174538 definitely the claim would be based on character defamation as my character as a district official prominent businessman and above all a law abiding citizen of navua and fiji has been defamed by the labasa president and his officials
8174539 i am not going to compromise or settle the matter as i have suffered a lot and it would only be nice and fair that the opposition also get the same treatment
8174540 i know that serevi has accepted the offer letter but what i will ask tomorrow is why the delay
8174541 they have to act quickly because the season is approaching i want to know why it is taking too long to come to an agreement
8174542 the only thing we have so far is the 10 000 donated by the interim government we are hopeful for miracle because we need money
8174543 we want to move ahead with our preparations for the mini games next year and the world under 21 championships in the cook islands there is no money so we are stuck with our preparations
8174544 no overseas based players have shown interest but walker will select 15 players for the u21 and 30 for the main national team

8174553 when your blogging career takes off im staying at home with the kids
8174554 the tournament is a nice start to the season and gives the players some match experience at a new age group
8174555 it will obviously be a learning curve for everyone involved but thats what these tournaments are all about
8174556 italy and portugal have a history of producing good teams at youth level so theyll be a great test
8174557 israel will provide a different kind of opposition theyll be strong and competitive so it will be a good mix of games
8174558 i deliberately chose songs that werent lullabies so that people who dont have kids at all will just think its a nice record
8174559 we did a few test listens and we got comments like i like mellow records like norah jones and this is something i would listen to in the morning
8174560 i didnt want to limit the audience to just parents and kids but the inspiration did come from being a mom and wanting to make a record for them that would be really high quality
8174561 i tell anyone else whos in the mom zone that this record will put kids to sleep without driving you bonkers i dont mean its going to bore them silly but it will lull them to sleep in a good way and the title came from the idea that you could play it a thousand times without getting tired of it
8174562 ive never done covers before but i chose songs that would work on two levels like devoted to you by the everly brothers sung with sexsmith which is a non lullaby lullaby and if you sing it to your child it becomes something beyond this beautifully simple love song
8174563 i was pleased with my song choices because the songs are all classics but they also take on a new meaning when you put this new interpretation on them
8174564 i thought i would maybe record it give it to my friends my mom would probably like it and it could be something id post on the website
8174565 but as we were recording i started to get more ideas about how it could go
8174566 it went to a place i wasnt expecting it to go and its fun when youre not even trying really and an idea just goes
8174567 now ive got a record to promote so im doing these maritime shows and im doing a mini tour of ontario and its great to be doing these shows its not easy its a juggling act i have a busy husband and were always tag teaming it but more and more im doing these mini tours where i can go out and play for three or four days and come back home again its perfect
8174568 do we treat teenagers like animals in heat or like people with a brain that have the ability to control themselves
8174569 we believe human beings can control their sexual desires and should be encouraged to
8174570 there has been a groundswell of opposition to these programs from states across the country and we thought we had put the issue to rest here in pennsylvania too
8174571 we are just trying to be fair across the board and make sure everyone has access to the funding they need
8174572 is being treated as a criminal investigation avalon is aggressively and immediately pursuing answers
8174573 we want to find out whos responsible for this act
8174574 authorities were fortunate to get some clues early in the investigation
8174575 but this wont take them to a specific office or individual like dr jones office in atlantic city
8174576 we cant comment on the source right now thats what were investigating
8174577 i think mayor pagliughi is probably right somebody came by and wanted to get rid of it medical waste
8174578 they knew it was illegal i cant imagine it was a mistake
8174579 i think it was done intentionally and when they find them i hope they stick it to them with a couple of their own needles throw the book at them
8174580 every shore community feels for avalon because someone might want to do it along their shore avalon is a great place with clean beaches
8174581 it could have fallen off a barge but it wouldve had to be really close to the shoreline barges are usually five to seven miles out
8174582 it would have to remain in a container or bag until broken apart by the wave action on the beach
8174583 someone could have taken a hike along the beach and gotten rid of the stuff in the middle of the night
8174584 we are carefully and continually monitoring the avalon beaches during this unfortunate event and will do everything we can to keep the beaches safe and open
8174585 that doesnt mean the issue is any less important doesnt mean were on the right track
8174586 we have a much weaker economy than a year ago much higher inflation very unlikely that this trend will continue into 2008
8174587 in face of crisis different states are doing the best they can to come up with band aid solutions
8174588 is this fact the majority of those people without insurance are employed
8174589 whether its 47 million or 45 million uninsured americans thats not an acceptable number
8174590 i realize as difficult times continue you may see people dropping coverage as they lose jobs or employers cut back
8174591 were just as concerned with keeping costs down for those who have coverage as with getting the 45 million into coverage

8174595 the boys come from all sides of the town for example epping mill park and taylors lakes and these players have come and migrated from fiji theyre staying here and working full time
8174596 this is our first year the boys have come together we started playing socially at hampton park and we decided to give it a go in a league
8174597 we approached michael herbert the president of hampton park and he said we could play third division
8174598 from there i became a committee member we started training and thats how we got into the league
8174599 its not only soccer after the game we come together in the club rooms and we throw a barbecue and theres a good bond with the boys
8174600 another thing with the fijian boys theres a good culture to respect their upper elders and also respect among the players and towards me as a coach
8174601 they come and play just because of our culture what it means is a friendly environment and everyone loves playing soccer theyre full of passion for it
8174602 his name and what he achieved its so far out of any players reach in his time or any player who has played since its almost like he played a different game to what were playing

8174604 the worlds spiritual home of cricket don being by far the best cricketer of all time
8174605 it will not only be the bradman museum but it will be the international cricket hall of fame whose captain will be don bradman and the team will be obviously the best
8174606 the initial team of 12 people will be from all over the world i dont know exactly who they will be but they will include people like sachin tendulkar from india

8174622 fog formation does require all of the elements that normal cloud formation requires with the most important being condensation nuclei when the air is saturated additional moisture tends to condense rather than staying in the air as vapor condensation nuclei must be present in the form of dust aeresols pollutants etc for the water to condense upon when there are exceptional amounts of condensation nuclei present especially hydroscopic water seeking such as salt see below then the water vapor may condense below 100 relative humidity

8174631 there was this horrible sucking sound and i rushed through from the conservatory where i had been pruning the bonsai oaks and i saw that all that was left of him was his bum spinning to a standstill on his chair
8174632 it was kind of gross shouting into a bum like that

8174634 he may have been careless he may have been naive he may have been loads of things but so far there are no convictions so how can aig suddenly decide as a so called reputable insurance company sponsors of football clubs and all the rest of it that there is no cover i just dont understand
8174635 well i suppose we can simply ask aig for a formal statement what is the legal basis not opinion just the legal basis for voiding someones insurance policy because im sure anyone out there thats got an insurance policy with aig will be wondering where they stand at the moment
8174636 aig ireland pays all its legitimate claims we cannot comment on any individual claim due to client confidentiality as with any insurance company policies they are only voided if there is just cause to do so in accordance with local laws

8174639 the current economic climate presents a challenge to all media companies throughout the world it also presents opportunities not least the potential for joint ventures shared investments mergers and divestments which may change perceptions of the structure and nature of media
8174640 the pattern of these unusual structural opportunities will we believe be of benefit to shareholders and bring renewed confidence back to the sector as the global economy goes through its present recessionary period

8174651 an attempt to demonize bill as a way of damaging barack obama
8174652 why does barack obama have a relationship with an unrepentant terrorist
8174653 why is barack obama not being forthcoming about his relationship
8174654 ive never heard anything as awful or as sexist or as racist as to call her that for supporting hillary
8174655 last night i was called an uncle tom by emil jones in the lobby of the hotel right in front of ald freddrenna lyle and ald leslie hairston and ald latasha thomas
8174656 i walked over to him and asked him what did you just call me
8174657 i think its a misuse of words theres no uncle toms anybody supporting hillary obama its just a mischoice of words
8174658 there are people who want to hurt barack obama because of his race and sometimes i fear for his safety
8174659 editor could we get this straight once and for all barack obama did not vote against the iraq war for the simple reason that he was not in the u s senate at that time a minimal requirement for a vote wouldnt you agree he did make a speech according to him in chicago during anti war protests but no one seems to have a tape of it i can certainly agree with reader glenn kardel on one point though obamas suggestion that we invade pakistan would be a disaster this would be especially so considering that he has absolutely no foreign policy experience or expertise a week in europe doesnt count and certainly 143 days in the senate doesnt cut it either
8174660 as more and more details emerge regarding his nefarious connections to william ayers not just a neighbor down the street the jailed felon resko quid quo pro 14million funneled to him by barack via the state of illinois for a below market real estate deal to barack and michelle obama along with his extreme leftist ideology reparations redistribution of wealth etc and illegal campaign donations from foreign residents it will be a cold day in hades before he moves into the white house

8174673 the charges submitted are sufficient to warrant a hearing on the merits and a stay of the proceedings is inappropriate
8174674 conceal from or fail to disclose to the council information material to its review and approval of the settlements
8174675 the requisite taint identified by the court for purposes of official misconduct is established when a public officer engages in activities in his official capacity for personal gain and conceals information about those activities
8174676 courts have restricted application of the due process clause to situations affecting a persons life liberty or property
8174677 the protections afforded an accused officer do not include the right to suspend a removal proceeding while criminal charges are pending even when those charges are based on the same facts and circumstances
8174678 this is so because the two proceedings are inherently different in their nature and purpose such that the onset of one proceeding before during or after the other neither deprives the individual of due process nor violates the constitutional prohibitions against self incrimination and double jeopardy
8174679 we intend to present evidence that proves the mayor did not misuse public funds for personal gain and that there was no failure to appropriately inform city council about the facts of the court ordered settlement
8174680 our only expectation for the hearing next week is that it is rooted in law and not the political pressures that have surrounded this matter it is only fair that every person in these united states receives a fair trial and that includes mayor kwame kilpatrick
8174681 my reading of this is the governor carefully considered these issues looked at them very carefully did her own independent research clearly and issued a detailed careful and very well crafted opinion
8174682 i believe its eminently fair balanced and ultimately likely to result in justice
8174683 i would encourage the governor to move forward and not be hamstrung by that
8174684 however the governor is a lawyer a former attorney general
8174685 she must have thought it through carefully im disappointed but i cant second guess her

8175021 for me a phase of weakening and a progressive convalescence is the most likely scenario
8175022 domestic demand in particular is developing less strongly than anticipated but this weakness will be temporary
8175023 weak banks should be allowed to disappear from the market

8175030 no recibir gol en la ida nos da una peque a ventaja
8175031 the population of the united states is almost a bulls eye for rolla
8175032 actually the last time i heard it was a steel mill about nineteen or twenty miles southeast of us
8175033 we just wanted to show our support for barack obama
8175034 well ive heard him speak i follow politics on tv and in print and everything i do the best i can to keep up with it and from everything ive seen of course im a little prejudiced because im a democrat and he got the democratic nomination and hes the one im supporting
8175035 to tell the truth at first i was for joe biden i like him because he says what he means if he gets upset with something i mean he gets with it but he didnt get traction so now with biden as vice president i got both of what i wanted
8175036 the reason we chose this is several years ago mel carnahan of rolla missouri was running for governor
8175037 we just kind of thought if we had rednecks for carnahan well wed have rednecks for obama
8175038 ive seen so many people coming by here going look at that and weve had a lot of camera action
8175039 ive had people step out here and ask me what entitles me to call myself a redneck
8175040 shoot im from the country i was raised without running water in the house till i was out of high school i went to a one room schoolhouse ive raised hogs ive raised cattle ive raised chickens i hunt i fish i own guns i own a boat a four wheel drive and i like nascar if that dont qualify me to be a damn redneck i dont know what the hell does
8175041 yeah thats the message were trying to send out dont be afraid to vote for obama
8175042 i dont know some people just dont like change and weve never had a president that was the skin color he is but that dont cut no ice with me i dont care if youre black green or yellow if youre qualified for the job and he certainly is
8175043 maybe people will think if these rednecks are from rolla maybe it aint so bad being for obama
8175044 did exposure to tce from the cts site cause more than the expected number of cases of the types of cancer known to be related to tce
8175045 if surgery is advised researching the best possible doctor and hospital for the child is essential
8175046 parents have many questions about the surgical procedure and almost always they first ask me where can i find a child surgeon
8175047 the more knowledgeable parents are about their childs condition the better they will be able to manage his or her care
8175048 regardless of the surgeons opinion if parents feel uncertain they should not hesitate to ask questions for further clarification
8175049 once the parents have developed confidence with the medical team and facility their child will sense their level of comfort
8175050 the parents will be able to express their support and love much more comfortably because their minds will not be preoccupied with as much uncertainty
8175051 were playing everything by ear well sit down with a big sigh of relief whenever and however its completed
8175052 these folks get to be mourned get to be remembered and get to be honored
8175053 ive made the calls before but ive never been the head coach im looking forward to it

8175055 we wanted to get students involved with the team and really create that home court advantage here at moby especially since this is supposed to be such a big year
8175056 the fan base is really important to our team and we want to connect with the fans and show them that their support helps us play better at home and we want to show them that we are a good team
8175057 im most excited about the opportunity to return a serve from one of the players
8175058 the idea by design is to minimize the amount of waste going toward the landfill to reuse and resource the materials that are being used inside here
8175059 were kind of sorting it all out and trying to keep the landfill part to a minimum
8175060 as far as we know this is the largest effort ever made to do this
8175061 its a big goal but our team is going to work as hard as they can to reach that goal
8175062 the steps being made to do that minimize landfill bound waste for example are the vendors the food vendors theyre only allowed to use biodegradable materials
8175063 if we want the american people to read this weve got to produce it in a length that theyre comfortable with
8175064 were looking for rising leaders the one unifying factor for us is leadership capability so these students already come with a desire to make a difference
8175065 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8175066 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8175067 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8175068 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8175069 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8175070 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8175071 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8175072 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8175073 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8175074 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8175075 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8175076 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8175077 were still receiving tips that some of the other fugitives at least one or two of the other fugitives could be in
8175078 working that angle very hard and thats going to be a very high priority focus
8175079 i saw burned bodies wounded people and small pools of blood
8175080 det r andra kvartalet i rad som antalet tidsbegr nsat anst llda minskar vilket visar p ett tydligt trendbrott mot den utveckling som funnits p arbetsmarknaden under de senaste ren
8175081 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8175082 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8175083 wij doen alles wat mogelijk is om een nieuwe koude oorlog te vermijden
8175084 maar in deze situatie ligt de bal in het kamp van de europeanen
8175085 indien zij europa een verslechtering willen van de relaties dan zullen zij die uiteraard krijgen
8175086 maar als zij strategische relaties willen behouden wat helemaal in het belang is van zowel rusland als europa dan zal alles goed gaan

8175109 john mccain zegt dat het fundament van onze economie prima is john mccain denkt dat 47 miljoen mensen zonder gezondheidszorg geen crisis is en in 2008 denkt hij nog steeds dat het ok is om vrouwen voor hetzelfde werk minder te betalen dan mannen met zon agenda is het geen wonder dat george bush en john mccain volgende week samenkomen in de tweelingstad st paul minneapolis want deze dagen zijn ze maar moeilijk uit elkaar te houden
8175110 ik ben erg blij dat ze zo duidelijk was over haar steun aan obama dit is wat de partij nodig had maar dit is nog maar het begin clinton moet dit soort toespraken steeds opnieuw geven en twijfelaars duidelijk maken dat obama onze leider is want alleen als we met zijn allen achter obama gaan staan kunnen we winnen in november

8175141 with search users type what they want to find with ubiquity they type what they want to do
8175142 the move back to language started with web search engines in general with google placing the capstone when its name became the house hold verb for typing to find what you want
8175143 in fact googling is almost always faster than wading through my bookmark menu which says there is something wrong with using menus as a mechanism for accessing bookmarks

8175148 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8175149 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8175150 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8175151 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8175152 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals

8175161 if were managing coral reefs we need to integrate that management with the surrounding forests

8175168 the cane toads cannot survive in much of southern australia because they would be too cold to move about and forage or spawn
8175169 we found that cane toads can barely hop once they get below about 15 degrees celsius

8175177 its so easy to demolish a building thats been there for 100 or 150 years we just dont value them
8175178 in the past 20 years slowly but surely most of our heritage buildings are disappearing
8175179 right now the reduction in taxes is an incentive to demolish a building

8175181 he is one of the best strikers in the world and in the summer he was sensational
8175182 with robbie keane we are even more dangerous many european clubs would be happy with a strikeforce of torres kuyt and keane
8175183 it is a luxury and we are guaranteed many goals in the competitions
8175184 it would be naive to assume they wont be targeted
8175185 the taliban have shown a capacity to strike in places where they werent active before and that is an issue
8175186 in the early stages of reconstruction there is a risk management issue
8175187 it depends on the region and in those regions where security risks are highest you have to approach it differently
8175188 its appropriate that its not just foreigners who are delivering the aid
8175189 theres a glimmer of hope that we hope the guy is not going down the wrong path

8175197 some of them dont like the sound of the clippers
8175198 theyre what we call very docile horses very easygoing very adaptable to all sorts of situations whether its climate noise people
8175199 being a male they are larger than the average this way we have a very calm horse and a very large horse out there for display
8175200 they just know when the harness goes on that its time to go to work
8175201 theyre great to work with and im just very proud to be working when them and representing the company
8175202 theres a substantial amount of information we have yet to see
8175203 my understanding is there was a boyfriend girlfriend relationship between the accused and victim of the alleged assault
8175204 the only thing i can comment on at this time is that it appears the assault had taken place before the actual homicide took place
8175205 gee how should i get this guy out oh i guess ill do x this time
8175206 were playing everything by ear well sit down with a big sigh of relief whenever and however its completed
8175207 these folks get to be mourned get to be remembered and get to be honored
8175208 i saw some guys tent thrown on the fire then his bags then he got beaten up
8175209 when the security guy tried to stop the fire his extinguisher was taken off him and he got taken out
8175210 this was going on opposite our tents in the indigo camp we ended up having to pack up our stuff at 3am because of the w s ruining it for everyone
8175211 packed up before tenacious d and then left after metallica i wanted to keep my tent and contents for next year
8175212 i know sunday night involves some people acting stupidly setting fires and blowing up the canisters which i detest and hate
8175213 some idiots started a fire behind our camp which then attracted many more rioters around the fire chanting and then the chant became gazebo
8175214 they proceeded to attack another tent pull it apart and put it on to the fire at this point one individual then pulled out the content of a girls tent out broke her guitar and started to throw it on the fire and then started to remove more contents
8175215 the girl along with my daughter then tried to stop him removing the contents as it was just behind our camp and could see it escalating more and taking in our tents
8175216 this is the very most serious bit the guy was very abusive toward the girls he told her to get out of the tent or he would burn her with the tent which she refused to do
8175217 he then started to pull the tent with my daughter inside toward the fire
8175218 luckily another guy held on to the other corner of the tent and stopped the burning of the tent and human contents as she was unable to scramble out
8175219 he was heading for a charge of assault gbh manslaughter or worst case murder

8175241 indias jewellery manufacturers are paying as much as 5 to 6 an ounce above the world market price of gold reflecting tight local supplies
8175242 given the recent price responsiveness of demand and the advent of the festival season beginning next week india should provide strong support to the world market cushioning and probably limiting any decline to 800 or below
8175243 demand has been phenomenally high it has been around 20 days since demand revived
8175244 this time demand has been continually good and if prices stay like this it will continue to be good for the next 10 to 20 days the only thing that could stop this would be gold going above 850 an ounce
8175245 buyers believe prices may fall further from current levels but they are not expecting too much of a downside everyone is a buyer now people who earlier bought only for near term needs are now stocking up for diwali
8175246 there is still not much stock around so we are quoting premiums at 1 20

8175260 the tax will fall most heavily on the weakest so the conclusion is the weak are going to get weaker and the strong will be able to take advantage of the weak
8175261 the numbers are alarming but we are coming off of an incredibly low base of problem institutions and failures
8175262 this is nowhere near what we had seen during prior periods of weakness are we done i dont think anyone would predict that we have a ways to go

8175281 i wasnt sure clark was a good enough football player
8175282 but he was a good kid i thought maybe someday hed be a linebacker something like that i wasnt sure at all hed ever play quarterback for us
8175283 he was at kiski a week and he called me and said jay theres no girls here
8175284 we look at hundreds and hundreds of tapes and sometimes we cant figure out if we like someone or dont like him
8175285 and im talking about guys who have coached great players but i gotta say daryll clark surprised me
8175286 i just think that clark is a little bit ahead of the other two hes had a little bit more experience hes done everything weve asked of him i felt he was the best choice for our football team
8175287 jay was trying to get me to play clark more in 2007
8175288 i just didnt think it was right for morelli morelli was getting all kinds of hell from everybody and i didnt think it was fair i had a little loyalty to morelli
8175289 its sad because ive been a quarterback since i was 6 years old so i know what i can do
8175290 where you find out about somebody is when the games on the line 2 minutes to go youve got to drive the ball down the field to win it

8175302 why does my company need to do press releases how will press releases benefit my seo campaign
8175303 thats one of the most common questions i get from the parents why do we have to treat these theyre just baby teeth arent they going to fall out
8175304 we need those teeth not only for function but for speech but also they serve as kind of a spacer to guide in the permanent teeth
8175305 if we havent seen them before theyre three and they havent had the opportunity to learn about how to prevent diseases by not putting your infant to bed with the bottle or sugary liquid or juice and how to limit the snacks then unfortunately sometimes when i have a 3 year old come in the decay is so extensive that we have to put them to sleep under general anesthesia
8175306 make sure that youre not sharing spoons and forks with your child the baby is not born with the bacteria that causes cavities so youre actually transmitting it
8175307 in small circular motions massage the teeth around the gums because thats where the plague is going to develop first plaque is the bacteria that causes the cavities
8175308 then they grow up without the fear and anxiety of seeing a dentist and your children could be cavity free for life if we start early
8175309 jean knows her product and shows up on time we can count on her so we purchase from her

8175312 i talk to a school nurse and thats the only one who ever offered to help us
8175313 they took care of his teeth and he smiles at everybody now
8175314 studies have identified dental problems as a primary reason children miss school
8175315 if you do enough programs with kids on proper cleaning it does continue throughout the years and lowers the amount of decay
8175316 you can treat something forever but if you dont prevent it youre never going to get on top of it
8175317 we teach them about brushing flossing the value of nutrition
8175318 so it does not stop with the children we want to reach out to the whole entire family
8175319 i want to make sure her teeth stay good and healthy so shell have them for a while and so she doesnt have problems as an adult

8175323 weve got a great coaching staff and we work hard on preparing them everyday

8175342 la parte reazionaria del discorso del comico lo sfott c una grande differenza fra il teatro sfott e il teatro di satira il teatro di satira sempre morale basti pensare al timore al panico che hanno avuto sempre i potenti davanti ai problemi della satira perch la satira in molti casi ha determinato la presa di coscienza della gente soprattutto delle classi inferiori ha fatto capire di avere il potere di ribaltare le situazioni di avere il coraggio quindi temuta qual la differenza che esiste fra fare satira e fare sfott allora posso dire a un giovane attento che giocare esclusivamente sulla pura caricatura legata a un personaggio anche a un uomo politico che grasso piccolo magro magari ha la gobba magari si intartaglia non realizza niente questo fa fare soltanto una risata fine a se stessa ma se non c la dimensione morale se tu attraverso la satira non riesci a far capire il significato opposto delle banalit dellovvio dellipocrisia soprattutto e della violenza che ogni potere esprime e porta addosso ai minori ebbene il tuo ridere vuoto proprio lo sghignazzo ventrale e non quello dello stomaco e dei polmoni

8175351 goddess im going broke trying to pay for three college educations for my children how are you going to pay for 16
8175352 had a good spring practice and a really good preseason
8175353 so were going to go with clark and start him but i dont want him looking over his shoulder
8175354 theres a psychological element that goes into playing quarterback joes not saying ive tattooed this position on your back but a quarterback has to know that hes going to have some ups and downs and still have our confidence
8175355 i told clark and ill tell him again before he goes on the field and when we meet on friday hey just go in there and enjoy it
8175356 clark smiles i said to the other two kids you guys ok with that yeah lets go win that was it
8175357 pats a competitor and im sure hes looking at it that its not done yet
8175358 both of them can run the same offense but their strengths are different
8175359 pats been the guy more comfortable in the pocket and darylls more of a get him out of the pocket and let him make plays guy
8175360 i know people are going to say we picked daryll because hes the older guy
8175361 number one if we did that we would have picked paul a graduate student so that debunks that and number two thats not being fair to daryll
8175362 in three years afghanistan has gone from 82 percent of the provinces growing poppy to approximately 60 percent of the provinces being poppy free
8175363 at this point in time i would like to ask nato and isaf to concentrate on these three very physical targets targets in the hands of either insurgents or criminal groups
8175364 and therefore not attacking the farmers but attacking those who provide the opportunity for farmers to cultivate opium
8175365 india has no reason to clamp down on peaceful protests
8175366 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8175367 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8175368 it is prudent for the governor general to remain in canada
8175369 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8175370 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
8175371 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8175372 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8175373 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8175374 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8175375 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8175376 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8175377 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8175378 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
8175379 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum
8175380 all around peshawar on every side the situation is volatile because of the people coming from bajaur bara dera adam khel and the people from swat and waziristan
8175381 all of this is impacting the infrastructure in peshawar the schools the health system everything is overloaded
8175382 we had no idea it was going to happen the government didnt tell us anything and we didnt see them anywhere
8175383 we are doing what we can to support the people here
8175384 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus and the department has begun this assessment
8175385 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
8175386 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
8175387 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
8175388 we have great news related to the hardware but our priority is to drive home the message that zune is so much more than just a device
8175389 the take home message for women is that whether you are hooked on caffeine or not if you need a boost coffee improves your mental alertness and can have a calming affect on your heart rate
8175390 in addition a large coffee has more than enough caffeine to see these changes
8175391 for people at risk for high blood pressure if youre a habituated coffee drinker reducing your caffeine intake would be an effective way of potentially reducing your blood pressure
8175392 imprisoned during at least some of that time at a secret site
8175393 something is really dirty here everything about the governments story smells
8175394 whatever happened to this woman is terrible and its incumbent on us to find out what it was
8175395 zardari is a very unpredictable guy what kind of politics is he playing that kind of inconsistency will be very bad for pakistan
8175396 in my view if don bradman was playing today he would still have an average as twice as good as any other batsman in the world
8175397 with the advances in bat technology and training imagine how good don would be today it would be scary he is by far and away the best batsman ever and would still be today
8175398 its almost like hes separate from the game his name and what he achieved its so far out of any players reach
8175399 ricerche indipendenti hanno dimostrato che wave keyboard rende totalmente pi comodo scrivere a computer

8175401 the interior minister has instructed us to restore law and order as soon as possible
8175402 if they want to arrest us we will let them put us in jail and we wont seek bail
8175403 but the rally will continue they cant arrest us all there arent enough jails
8175404 its always been a mystery to us how they find their way back to a suitable habitat
8175405 weve actually narrowed down the chemical signals that they may be using to find their home
8175406 we were quite surprised to find that one of the things they were using was a terrestrial cue leaves falling into the water
8175407 have important implications for the management of island reef ecosystems
8175408 if were managing coral reefs we need to integrate that management with the surrounding forests
8175409 reefs with islands on them should be targeted by reef management because they become places that people use and theres usually a limited land area on islands which quite often is modified
8175410 oleh karena bangsa ini datang mendekat dengan mulutnya dan memuliakan aku dengan bibirnya padahal hatinya menjauh dari pada ku dan ibadahnya kepada ku hanyalah perintah manusia yang dihafalkan
8175411 can we afford four more years is it time for a change when do we need it and who do we need as the next president of the united states of america that s right barack obama is the change we need
8175412 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama as the next president of the united states
8175413 or any stage of the life cycle of the salmon
8175414 there is a high risk of pollution in the states biggest salmon watershed the mine while not yet designed is expected to produce billions of tons of tailings the initiative wouldnt necessarily stop pebble but would require the mine to use much more protective measures that reduce the risk to bristol bay fisheries
8175415 and hand the new law over to the legislature to clean up the rough edges
8175416 to save one of the last healthy wild salmon populations left
8175417 one of the greatest remaining runs is at risk from a giant gold and copper mine that would dominate the headwaters of alaskas bristol bay an extraordinarily rich fishery that produces about half of the wild salmon sold in north america
8175418 fundamentals for both the copper and molybdenum markets remain solid and we expect this to continue well into 2009
8175419 with our sound financial position we continue to make good progress with the groups plans for sustainable growth and this should result in further profitable volume growth from 2010 and beyond
8175420 barack obama e il mio candidato e dovra essere il nostro presidente
8175421 ho fatto la mia corsa presidenziale per rinnovare la promessa americana per ricostituire la classe media e sostenere il sogno americano voglio chiedervi questa campagna era solo per me o per quella madre che combatte il cancro e alleva due bambini malati il progresso e sempre difficile ma sara impossibile se non combattiamo per mettere un democratico alla casa bianca per questo dobbiamo eleggere barack obama
8175422 on my first record i didnt have a direction i just wanted to make a record
8175423 i feel pass it along is the best body of work ive done this is where i am now and where ive come from
8175424 how to make the world notice your video game blog
8175425 bowser takes peach mario chases after bowser bowser falls into some lava the end
8175426 it has a certain quiet elegance to it that is timeless and never quite goes out of style
8175427 this new series will be of the same caliber as the other two these writers know what they are doing they can write good television youve been with us this long stay with us for the ninth inning itll be worth it and thank you for the five years youve given us
8175428 i think network is going to take a page from the cablers and start developing scripted for summer as well
8175429 i dont think they will be able to get along over the next several years without going toe to toe with us in the summer
8175430 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8175431 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
8175432 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way how can anyone be this narcissistic you wonder in disbelief in appalled fascination after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book
8175433 handsomely reconstituted by new directions from the scarce original editions the unfortunates comes in a box of 27 unbound chapters
8175434 the young cartoonist dash shaw comes down firmly on the symbolic end of the comics continuum
8175435 all fears to the contrary however american wife is no hatchet job no gossipy kitty kelley bio in disguise nor is it hagiography or the sort of seamy political pulp fiction in which denizens of the capitol have been known to dabble rather it is an intelligent well crafted psychologically astute novel that granted will anger the overly literal and the easily outraged but such people are unlikely to be eager readers of contemporary fiction this book is for those of us who are
8175436 murray bail plays a laconic self concealing game cunningly luring the reader in to his interlinked stories the pages is not an easy or open book but it is an oddly compelling one the spell is most powerfully cast in which can make the world come alive on the page after all perhaps it is fiction that does best what this philosopher is trying for to grasp what he saw before him ordinary objects to fit words only to what can be seen
8175437 then there were wigs max persuaded cecil b de mille in town to direct the large scale western the squaw man that wigs and hairpieces painstakingly formed of real human hair 135 168 individually knotted strands went into an average max factor wig
8175438 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8175439 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8175440 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8175441 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8175443 cuando los hispanos necesitaron un amigo qui n estuvo all qui n habl por ustedes john mccain
8175444 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8175445 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8175446 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8175447 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8175448 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8175449 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8175450 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8175451 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8175452 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8175453 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8175454 the sense of smell connects the deep subconscious regions of the brain and triggers different emotions and behaviours
8175455 for example the aroma of food triggers a mouth watering sensation in preparation for digestion
8175456 conversely bad smells can protect us by warning us to stay away from something that might harm us
8175457 certain feelings are evoked by scents so lemon is traditionally associated with cleanliness and freshness but interestingly it also has antidepressant qualities too
8175458 i couldnt think about it you know me just brush it under the carpet and hope it will go away
8175459 theyd sent a letter to me ages ago telling me i needed to go in but id been too scared to do anything about it
8175460 though tension prevails in kandhamal the situation is improving gradually security forces have been able to enter inaccessible areas by removing obstacles placed by miscreants
8175461 this is similar to what others have found in autistic infants
8175462 btbr is the first mouse strain to have all three
8175463 we can begin to understand how the genetic mechanisms may all be working together
8175464 im glad countdown is over that was a long year of dc nation for me
8175465 when i first started at dc one of the franchises i really wanted to invigorate was teen titans as the legend goes paul levitz my boss didnt believe teen titans were going to work that well because we had done so many reboots before that and they all seemed to trip over it
8175466 when titans came out by geoff johns and mike mckone and was a big hit paul came into my office threw a copy of teen titans onto my desk and goes too bad we cant do the same thing with legion
8175467 we know theres an audience out there and we keep on trying to get it right
8175468 one clear interpretation of the legion by the time were through
8175469 i dont think i ever said bart allen was dead i am serious
8175470 there were stories that were going to be told and there were definite crossovers taking place at the moment of the death of bart allen so there is a good chance there is going to be more resolutions to that character and what happened to him in the very near future or the very far future
8175471 driving a tremendous demand for telecommunications and information services this in turn is creating a huge market for us
8175472 is the british muslim allowed to kill british civilians whether they are nonbelievers or muslims who support the war against afghanistan iraq and others
8175473 the links between those arrested and umar rabie are central to this any attempted contact between rabie and known extremists is significant
8175474 the cane toads cannot survive in much of southern australia because they would be too cold to move about and forage or spawn
8175475 we found that cane toads can barely hop once they get below about 15 degrees celsius
8175476 their range would also be constrained by the limited availability of water for their tadpoles in some parts of australia
8175477 our study is particularly helpful in predicting where cane toads could live under climate change because we have identified a cause and effect way that climate limits the toads
8175478 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8175479 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8175480 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8175481 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8175482 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8175483 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8175484 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8175485 who are open to doing something on the production side
8175486 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8175487 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8175488 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8175489 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8175490 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8175491 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8175492 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8175493 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8175494 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8175495 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8175496 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8175497 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8175498 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8175499 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8175500 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8175501 maruti has been a consistent performer achieving a consistent growth in revenues and net profits over the last six years its margins both operating and net profit have also improved consistently since 2001 02 highlighting improved operational efficiencies
8175502 on the basis of our research we feel that this is a good stock to buy at the current market price of rs 631 85 if everything goes well the price is likely to appreciate to rs 830 0 within 12 18 months translating into a gain of about 32
8175503 yeah mate i noticed your homeport is juneau alaska our boat is also from juneau we bought it there in the mid 1990s it was a commercial fishing vessel and we converted it to an ocean going sailboat we sailed it from alaska to new zealand and are out here cruising now
8175504 i dont know why you came but i am here to praise the lord
8175505 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8175506 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8175507 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8175508 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8175509 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8175510 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8175511 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8175512 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8175513 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8175514 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8175515 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8175516 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8175517 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8175518 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8175519 the disk you inserted cannot be read by this computer
8175520 am very interested to also learn how to stop my chihuahuas from running up down the stairs i have tried to walk up the stairs first blocking them on every third step or so sometimes it works other times the three little brats run past me and believe it or not these brats do not respond to treats
8175521 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8175522 not at all sir it would have been a privilege to be in the same theatre as you even if you were sweeping out the stalls
8175523 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8175524 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8175525 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8175526 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8175527 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

8175717 mr broadus has not been granted a visa there are further steps required beyond character assessment before a visa is granted
8175718 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus

8175732 people may question that a true freshman comes in here and gets a few snaps on thursday night but i just want to try to take advantage of every opportunity and show what i can do
8175733 jaybo opened a lot of doors for people here at flowery branch
8175734 his senior year he probably checked off 85 percent of the time
8175735 he asks every day how was practice and how are classes coming
8175736 he tries to come out here when he can and watch practice but of course hes got a team to coach my family will be here thursday night and im very grateful for that
8175737 i think hes good enough to help us win the game so were going to put him in there and see what he does under fire
8175738 it did take some time to get back used to taking the snap and getting the reads
8175739 hes football smart as well he understands structures of defenses i knew once he got to the next level he would grow more there was a lot of room for improvement thats a fantastic coaching staff and i knew they would take him on

8175745 it was acting you know i wasnt great at working with others or the group collaboration at the time all i could handle was making music with four other people
8175746 coming from the rock n roll genre i was used to this real guys mentality durham county put me in this world run by these powerful intellectual women with something to say im forever indebted to them
8175747 there was anger there but our music was of a time and a place
8175748 there was so much mediocrity in music at the time nirvana had just come out but i honestly never thought about getting a record deal or the money we didnt care if we played to nine or 10 people all our spare money went to a rehearsal space and beer and the accoutrements
8175749 as a young man i never thought id make it past 30
8175750 i wanted the jim morrison live fast die young mentality
8175751 bruce showed me how to find a way into acting as an art form and then i gradually got into it
8175752 its good composition its a strong story its literate and the audiences get it and really like it
8175753 bragging rights are nice but its nice for our audience to say theyre the first audience in canada to be able to see this work its not about the company doing it first
8175754 as soon as you get into that too much emotionally youre doomed because then youre not paying attention to whats right for your audience and your community ive seen colleagues over the years get all excited about what they were doing and how it was enhancing their international reputation and pretty soon they didnt have a job
8175755 lots of times were asked isnt this going to make your long term subscribers upset
8175756 not at all long term operagoers are the ones who want to see something new theyve seen nine boh me s they really welcome good newer work
8175757 when you only do three or four productions a year four in our case if you are not thoughtful about how and when you do this work you can really get a company in trouble
8175758 you never know which part of the internet youll need which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8175759 that kind of gave him a spark for the films
8175760 hes one of those filmmakers who wants to be a musician and i think that the way his films are trying to capture little fresh moments is a cool approach
8175761 its very important to me to not let the musician try to make the song perfect
8175762 its so much more human when a musician is doing this beautiful version of a song but messes up and then continues yeah thats beautiful to me
8175763 as far as the modern world is concerned these are natural environments
8175764 its filmed in its own elements from where it came from the streets and the bars and peoples apartments
8175765 lets put the final nail in the coffin on the term music video and allow it to be something of the past because thats exactly what it is
8175766 it served its purpose very well in the 1980s and 1990s music videos time came and went
8175767 i dont think music or film has been in a more exciting place in 20 years
8175768 i was just blown away by their beauty and how raw they were
8175769 we were just getting a little bit bored of watching the music promos
8175770 we didnt have much clout or really any money so the idea was to try to find a way to get our vision out there and get people to buy into it
8175771 a significant shift in the way people are watching music film
8175772 with search users type what they want to find with ubiquity they type what they want to do
8175773 the move back to language started with web search engines in general with google placing the capstone when its name became the house hold verb for typing to find what you want
8175774 in fact googling is almost always faster than wading through my bookmark menu which says there is something wrong with using menus as a mechanism for accessing bookmarks
8175775 it was obviously maybe the biggest pitch in the game
8175776 we got ourselves in a position where one pitch can turn the game around and masterson comes in and makes one pitch and gets out of the inning that was huge
8175777 in my respects hes a good righthanded hitter and when im called upon im supposed to get the job done i won that time
8175778 obviously i love that stuff thats why you play the game
8175779 we dont panic here you hit the panic button you just get worse right right
8175780 lou cucuzza the clubhouse guy got me some dirt from the mound its pretty special playing in this league the last 14 15 years and pitching here for such a long period of time its such a cathedral of sports
8175781 to walk the hallowed grounds that such great players before us have played their game and walked and ran and hit its pretty special
8175782 thats about as big a situation as youre going to find poise is not a problem he deserves to be used in those situations
8175783 that was probably what we were hoping for getting one pitch and getting out of that inning is the best case scenario he made a very good pitch and we got out of that inning
8175784 you see these do you guys have these now go strap on a set and get out there and win this f ing game

8175874 as with all businesses woodside must pass on increased cost
8175875 the idea that we can somehow afford this cost into our business is unrealistic
8175876 this unexpected new tax is no different to any other cost
8175877 it will be passed on to customers over the next few months and years as we reopen and renew domestic contracts and well recover as much as we can if not all of the tax burden

8175930 that is a danger to be complacent but there is so much at stake it would be criminal not to be focused
8175931 it is either being in the group stages on friday or being out
8175932 anything can happen at that level because we had a very difficult first leg but it cannot be just because you were taking this game lightly
8175933 the tie is not dead because you could see from the first leg how quickly we could score two goals from nothing
8175934 we have done the job well at twente but the job is not over
8175935 we have to respect twente and come into the game with a desire to win

8175988 it seems that all the goals i set for myself at the beginning of the filming have all been achieved
8175989 this was my first kbs drama and my first sageuk drama that in itself ive already accomplished two goals
8175990 actually as i have a recurring back injury i already declined several projects as i was thinking that i should try doing other things rather than to aggravate the injury but the people around me encouraged and motivated me
8175991 if i decided to rest because it was getting tough i think it would have become more difficult for me if i rested any longer when we first started my back was giving me trouble but after the training i can now do simple stunts like horseriding it feels good
8175992 i hoped for health i hoped for my spirits to be lifted and i hoped for the people who have supported and protected me all this while will be happy
8175993 before we started filming i said that i hoped for the ratings to hit 15 and although it was the olympics and other reasons that helped us to achieve that but we achieved that goal anyway my back is getting better too an average of 11 12 of korean viewers were tuning in and although i cant say im 100 satisfied but yes weve achieved what we set out to do
8175994 i did hope for more support for the drama although we cant say that there was a consistent review of whether we did well or not but its good that no one was hurt by the remarks although the results were less than desired in korea but i hope that it will do better overseas
8175995 firstly well be going on a short trip together jeon noh min hyung cant join us because he has to start on his new weekend drama but the rest of us are planning for a short vacation together
8175996 die hochschulpr sidenten haben die notwendigen kompromisse gemeinsam mit dem ministerium erarbeitet das gilt auch f r die frage wo die nth k nftig ihren sitz haben wird
8175997 das projekt nth ist auf initiative der beteiligten hochschulen entwickelt und nicht von oben verordnet worden es bleibt dabei dass die politik die rechtlichen und finanziellen rahmenbedingungen schaffen kann aber die hochschulen werden die nth selbst mit leben f llen m ssen
8175998 es war mir gerade in diesem projekt besonders wichtig die beteiligten universit ten fr hzeitig und kontinuierlich einzubinden denn eine konstruktive zusammenarbeit von universit ten die auch eine wissenschaftliche schwerpunktbildung bewirken soll ist nur m glich wenn die professorinnen und professoren die angestrebten vorteile wollen und erkennen
8175999 vielmehr erwarte ich dass bereits bestehende kooperationen noch weiter ausgebaut werden und neue hinzukommen

8176012 the message is loud and clear childrens lives are meaningless a child is worth five years
8176013 this was a little defenceless child this will not deter others
8176014 that and taking responsibility are indicators of remorse and show whether or not an individual has the potential to change
8176015 it seems to me that he was showing more remorse towards himself
8176016 i believe that he should have been assessed to gauge the future risk to society and more specifically to his other children he should also have been exposed to therapy because we do not know what sparked the incident
8176017 killing of children is on the increase they are being used as scapegoats by adults who cannot control anger and aggression in the face of this this sentence and the way this matter was dealt with is of great concern
8176018 who can guarantee us that other children will be safe when he comes out of jail
8176019 how do you stop the angry person without enough sense
8176020 its not going to take very long for it to be a total massacre
8176021 which risk is more likely that someone is going to accidentally set off a gun in class and god forbid hit a student or someone will come in off the highway and start a random shooting spree
8176022 thats the place people could go if they are feeling crazy or mad at the world and get a big body count
8176023 most high school seniors been huntin on their own since the age of 12
8176024 these are country people they grow up with guns its nothing unusual
8176025 a lot of responsibility for someone who already has a lot of responsibility in the classroom
8176026 they then perform inappropriate treatments resulting in unsatisfactory results and complications that require dermatological treatment
8176027 the word laser is charged with the promise of high technology and conjures up expectations that almost reach magical proportions
8176028 in practice however inappropriate treatment given by inadequately trained and inexperienced operators casts a spell on patients that may last for the rest of their lives
8176029 we wish to warn prospective patients to first check the qualifications of operators before undergoing treatment and to preferably consult a trained medical professional to achieve optimal results without unnecessary complications and unrealistic expectations
8176030 and a colleague had a case where dilated veins were treated with an nd yag laser leaving the patient with a thick scar on her leg
8176031 he also tells of a case where a general practitioner misdiagnosed a basal cell carcinoma skin cancer and tried to treat it with a laser
8176032 another of my colleagues has seen complications from botox injections and electrocautery done by a beauty therapist a practice that is illegal
8176033 what were seeing is an overwhelming preponderance at this point of these untrained people getting their hands on these devices and using them

8176083 we expect that banks and thrifts will keep building up reserves for the next several quarters
8176084 the tax will fall most heavily on the weakest so the conclusion is the weak are going to get weaker and the strong will be able to take advantage of the weak
8176085 the numbers are alarming but we are coming off of an incredibly low base of problem institutions and failures
8176086 this is nowhere near what we had seen during prior periods of weakness are we done i dont think anyone would predict that we have a ways to go

8176109 i heard last night the most remarkable speech ive heard in my life
8176110 when this convention is over and three and four years from now in the comments of why the democrats won it will come back to the single most amazing event at the democratic convention it was michelle obama not barack obama not bill clinton not ted kennedy
8176111 ladies and gentlemen other than ending the war in iraq the single most significant thing that barack obama will do will be to determine who the next members of the supreme court will be so folks remember when you go out there it is not only a womans right to choose that is at stake it is also whether or not you will have a fair shot at a fair wage it is whether or not you are treated equally in every aspect of your life it is literally literally at stake
8176112 ladies and gentlemen most of them ladies thank god for small favors
8176113 i just want you know that this is a great honor being nominated as vice president of the united states and im proud of it but it pales in comparison to the great honor that ive had

8176125 dergelijke demonstraties zijn elders in het verleden wel eens uit de hand gelopen ik probeer hier confrontaties te voorkomen
8176126 ervaring is iets wat je hebt net nadat je het nodig had
8176127 werkgevers zullen de komende jaren forse inspanningen moeten verrichten om werknemers voor hun organisatie te behouden
8176128 zeker bij de jongere generatie zie je wisselingen sneller plaatsvinden
8176129 goede jonge mensen weten dat er schaarste is zij hebben ook de neiging te denken zo ik ben ergens goed in ik verbind me aan dit bedrijf voor een bepaalde klus die kan n twee of drie jaar duren en daarna is het wel weer leuk om eens iets anders te gaan doen
8176130 ze gaan als zzper of zelfstandige aan de slag en verhuren zich aan bedrijven
8176131 neem de aanwezigheidsplicht vroeger moest je om negen uur op de zaak zijn tot vijf uur halfzes en als je om tien uur binnenkwam hoorde je er niet bij nu willen mensen eerst hun kinderen wegbrengen of ze moeten eerder naar huis dat moet gewoon kunnen is de gedachte
8176132 ze moeten erin geloven dat mensen verantwoordelijkheid kunnen dragen dat het belangrijker is dat ze worden afgerekend op de klus die ze klaren dan of ze aanwezig zijn je moet vind ik beoordelen belonen en ontwikkelen op output
8176133 maar dat is een breed begrip het kan via scholing maar ook door het stimuleren van bezigheden naast het werk bijvoorbeeld vrijwilligerswerk dan draait het meer om persoonlijke ontwikkeling in plaats van vakinhoudelijke kennis
8176134 als iemand meer in zijn mars heeft moet je niet bang zijn dat hij buiten je bedrijf gaat kijken als jij verder geen mogelijkheden hebt je kunt beter mensen ontwikkelen en tijdelijk aan je binden terwijl je weet dat ze over drie jaar weggaan daar zijn afspraken over te maken
8176135 maar misschien zit er wel een duidelijke visie achter omdat iemand na twee drie jaar telkens iets anders wil doen trouwens jobhoppen kan ook binnen het eigen bedrijf de cruciale vraag is zit de werknemer aan het roer van de eigen ontwikkeling
8176136 het wil niet zeggen dat je het goed gedaan hebt als je lang ergens zit f dat je dan geen jobhopper bent iemand kan wel twintig jaar op dezelfde plek hebben zitten jobhoppen zonder zich te ontwikkelen
8176137 we gaan immers van incident naar incident en dat is niet goed dat is met de partijen besproken
8176138 te denken valt aan het verstrekken van informatie van het college aan de raad maar bijvoorbeeld ook hoe we omgaan met moties die door een raadsmeerderheid worden aangenomen en toch niet worden uitgevoerd zaken die wagenaarhoes onlangs ook heeft aangedragen

8176147 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8176148 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8176149 everybody was tired of hearing about it so they finally had to step up and do something to make a change
8176150 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8176151 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8176152 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8176153 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8176154 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8176155 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8176156 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8176157 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8176158 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl

8176271 i observe much psychological strength even in some of the most traumatised children these include childrens sense of autonomy early in life their ability to understand psychological issues their capacity for humour and their general creativity and playfulness evident in their love of drama art and imagery they have a strong sense of commitment to their siblings and family the very fact that aboriginal peoples are the oldest living culture and have survived the impact of colonisation is testimony to their resilience and the elders must have passed this on to the children of today

8176275 he was on his first solo flight and came quite close to a collision and was forced to do a spiral dive
8176276 he would have been doing circuits which means you are not more than 1 000 feet high and couldnt have had time to do it safely
8176277 i watched the plane fly over and thought it was coming very close to another plane then i saw a third plane and that was the one that it hit the right wing tip hit the tail of the plane that crashed
8176278 i think the attention of the pilot would have been on the first plane that he was getting really close to

8176301 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8176302 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8176303 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic
8176304 its going from bright ice to a much darker ocean
8176305 that allows for the breakdown of that by bacteria and other organisms that release co2 or methane depending on how the breakdown occurs
8176306 by the end of summer it gives me a 4 foot wall of plants and i can step out of my kitchen and grab a tomato

8176318 het staat ook voor ons buiten kijf dat de diefstal op zich zelf bezien afgekeurd moet worden de wijze waarop de stukken in de openbaarheid zijn gekomen is te betreuren het is echter evenzeer te betreuren dat de kamer in toenemende mate van bijzondere gebeurtenissen en van toevallige omstandigheden afhankelijk wordt een parlementaire democratie kan op deze wijze niet naar behoren functioneren wij verlangen van de regering voortaan tijdige en volledige opening van zaken

8176343 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8176344 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8176345 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8176383 i had a long breakfast with matty this morning and hes in a really good place at the moment when he was left out he didnt open his mouth or anything he just went back to the drawing board at sussex and has done a fantastic job there
8176384 hes turned up back here with us as a different bloke and hes been brilliant fair play to the guy because he could have gone away and felt sorry for himself but hes gone away and scored hundred after hundred for sussex
8176385 i was pleased he finished not out with six catches its brilliant because it has been a headache for however long with our wicketkeeper but lets hope it stays good because hes a hell of a batsman
8176386 we came off such a high in the test series some of the best moments in my career and this is right down there in terms of the lowest
8176387 we have to regroup pretty quickly take this blow on the chin come back from it and play our kind of cricket your confidence can take a big dent when you lose like this
8176388 its obviously been a factor playing on the minds of oil markets at the moment
8176389 theres a potential impact on production in the gulf of mexico area
8176390 were getting some pretty powerful data that suggests slower growth and higher gasoline prices have really crimped oil demand in the u s
8176391 after investigations the conclusion we reached is that these guns were stolen from policemen who have been the victims of criminal attacks
8176392 the global credit crunch is now entering its second year with few signs of easing world growth is deteriorating and the bear market is seemingly entrenched
8176393 this is not a good operating environment for any investment bank
8176394 globally we expect weaker equities volumes investment banking pipelines and softer commodities trading opportunities placing further pressure on macquaries revenues
8176395 there isnt a fence or a wall between the shrubbery and the couples property
8176396 the three men then presumably gained access to the house through a bathroom window they switched on the lights in the house which woke the elderly couple
8176397 my husband sat up with a fright and said what now
8176398 my husband shouted no and then the robber shot him on the left side of his chest its terrible he shot him before they said or asked anything
8176399 the robbers took all the womans rings off her fingers tied her up with rope and fled on foot about 45 minutes later taking a tv set and more jewellery
8176400 many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets but they keep some for their family
8176401 not only are our poor eating it but there is also demand from vietnamese living on the border with us
8176402 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8176403 how grateful he was for her support that she gave a terrific speech
8176404 he loved her line no way no how no mccain
8176405 senator obama also called and spoke with president bill clinton for several minutes saying senator clinton could not have been better and made the case for change
8176406 obama said he knew how proud he must have been watching as he was last night watching his wife michelle speak and how grateful he was for their support
8176407 weve unwound all gains since january so after such a fierce move i think technically it suggests the aussie may be due for a bit of consolidation
8176408 theres a long way to go on the us housing correction theres still a huge overhang of inventory and the sales that we are seeing are being generated on much lower prices
8176409 the interest rate differentials are certainly when you look in the big scheme of things are not going to move in the aussies favour anytime soon
8176410 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
8176411 examine from this point of view the consequences of russias decision
8176412 looking at a variety of options with regard to consequences for russias behaviour in georgia its aggression in georgia
8176413 if they want relations to worsen they will get it
8176414 russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point agreement
8176415 the united states and some european capitals are promising saakashvili defence by nato calling for the re arming of the tbilisi regime and already starting new arms deliveries to him
8176416 break the georgian state undermine the fundamental values of georgia and to wipe georgia fron the map
8176417 this is the first attempt in europe after nazi germany and the stalinist soviet union to put a neighbouring state on its knees and to change the borders of europe by force
8176418 international relations you cannot have one rule for some and another rule for others
8176419 there was no fundamental catalyst for any of it price movement
8176420 it was one of those days that you do not want to read too much into of two or three ticks action on low volumes
8176421 construction work done data was much weaker than expected but it was not a major catalyst for the price action
8176422 unfortunately there is not much we can look forward to
8176423 the positions and the risks have been set ahead of next weeks rba decision
8176424 us treasuries are responding more to a flight to quality type concerns at the moment the credit kind of things
8176425 the baby is healthy he is breathing on his own mum is jetlagged but stable
8176426 i got the operative end one got the comforting end the breathe breathe breathe end and the other got the looking after the baby end
8176427 there were four of us one surgeon one orthopaedic surgeon one kidney specialist and a humble gp who was the only one whod done very much in the way of deliveries so i got that end
8176428 i think we all had fun once we knew it was all safe
8176429 she was fortunate enough to have doctors on board the flight
8176430 dad is over the moon and he has rung grandparents back in india to tell them the news
8176431 we are hoping to reunite mother and baby this afternoon
8176432 if as a nation we are serious about lifting overall student performance and addressing underperformance and underachievement what we would have seen today is a statement of certainty from the prime minister
8176433 the loss of 1000 teaching positions would put upward pressure on class sizes and see the collapse of educational programs as a nation we cannot afford that
8176434 in a broad sense i think ways of rewarding high performance are welcome but the devil is in the detail mr mcalpine said
8176435 so long as its done in a way that reflects the genuine complexity and context of schools and the challenges of both leadership and teaching then i think it will be good thing
8176436 make a real difference but questioned where the funding would come from
8176437 i think it would be much better if the federal government could make direct funding to schools of an average of half a million dollars each and that funding be used to improve the learning in the school rather than the state governments having to meet the federal governments commitments he said
8176438 we are really concerned that this government is really not talking to the people it needs to talk to before its making decisions about whats best for australia she said
8176439 hes stating he knows what parents want well were not sure how hes actually engaged with the parents of state schools when he hasnt run this past the national body
8176440 we dont support any league tables weve seen what they can do in the uk weve seen cases of parents fighting with each other buying addresses raffle tickets so you can get in the line to get into a school thats higher up the league table she said
8176441 i knew it was a robbery the first thought that came to mind was to save the money he told the
8176442 in the midst of the commotion the robbers grabbed the money changers bags thinking that i had already placed the money bag onto the trolley he said
8176443 hold on ill call the cops and if they say pay him 20 then ill give you 20 dollars
8176444 nothing just look and if you like something well give you a good price and if you dont like anything you dont have to buy
8176445 i love arts and i would be more that happy to look at your work but im starving and need to eat first
8176446 watch out im coming through whether you move your butt or not
8176447 ober hir on da right side ees the execushon site
8176448 no one can afford to miss the musings of the chatty jancis
8176449 weve been committed to taking the practical steps to sustainability
8176450 there are a number of things you can do that are not outrageous but are responsible and use good common sense
8176451 were really proud of the steps weve taken and if you compare another event thats taking place the next week we feel really good about our track record
8176452 having someone stand next to a trash can i dont think so
8176453 we are trying to be stewards of the environment and are trying to encourage others to be
8176454 the republican party is home to theodore roosevelt who was the first american president to consider the long term needs for efficient conservation of natural resources
8176455 its more important what they talk about inside the convention the campaign platforms have to match the behavior
8176456 there was no car crash david and victoria beckham were driving a car that had been scratched the day before when it had been left parked at the airport they were not involved in any accident at all there was no police no crash no paparazzi chase etc just very incorrect reports via internet gossip sites
8176457 il avait entrepris des tudes de m decine mais il a tout lacher pour consacrer tout son temps au livre la vie dans le livre
8176458 we will see a much higher increase in dismissals as we are going to go into a recession
8176459 i think its going to easily last a couple of years or longer a recession historically lasts for a couple of years and i can see no reason why it would be shorter than that
8176460 when you have a major car manufacturer like mitsubishi close and another manufacturer like ford reduce its volume substantially and gm holden in a lacklustre position the components companies have reduced orders and there have been redundancies at component manufacturers as a consequence
8176461 they place great store in the need for living independently as long as possible in having easy access to health care services and in staying in their neighbourhood of choice and being close to loved ones

8176472 his addition to the arizona staff is an important piece in the future success of this program
8176473 we made the decision to take alemao out unfortunately it was a tough decision but we just thought that with cassio and diego theyve already been there and know what to expect and cristiano has got a fair bit of experience
8176474 we have also got cover if we have to on that side but it wasnt an easy decision because i would have liked to have all of them in there
8176475 obviously hes very disappointed but he copped it on the chin pretty well and i think the pleasing thing from alemao was that he said that it doesnt change anything hes still here and hes going to be committed for all of the other games
8176476 all four of them want to play but unfortunately i cant have all of them in there so that was the decision we made you have to play within the rules and thats the way we decided to go
8176477 im very sad that im not going to be able to go but now i will just be like one of the fans i will be cheering the team on
8176478 nothing is going to change im going to keep working hard and focus on doing my best in the hyundai a league

8176492 so many of my friends have had them and theyve gone wrong
8176493 one of my friends t ts started growing like the giant peach and blood started coming out the nipple
8176494 and then another friend of mine had one that sort of moved up to her shoulder one tit was normal and the other was up by her collarbone
8176495 i know only one girl who has good ones and most of them are so hard you can knock on them like a door
8176496 im not into them i mean if i got all saggy like the sacks some women have after they have children id have them done
8176497 im not against them but if you have normal ones just to have them enlarged for the sake of having big ones
8176498 weve got mounds of evidence that an extremely powerful and unprecedented climate driven change is underway

8176515 its going to have to be in the 4 to 5 range or its not going to float
8176516 obviously this is what we have to determine through the survey but i suspect that people are only willing to pay slightly more than a bus or a link service
8176517 if someone has to get in their car drive to the ferry find a place to park and then get on the ferry thats not going to fly at 2 or 7
8176518 but if we get people in and out efficiently if they can walk or shuttle or use a park and ride and make the price affordable then i think it could be interesting
8176519 im not ready to sign off on this yet i want to see the study and i want to see the cost because if its not going to be used then im not going to buy in
8176520 council has not definitely said go ahead were doing this
8176521 and i think many of us on council will continue to do that
8176522 is certainly more than the last information we had which showed us people would be less likely to use it if it were anything over 4
8176523 we have to make sure people are going to use it otherwise it would be a huge waste of money
8176524 we would expect that as the fares increase the number of people who would ride it would drop
8176525 but to understand where the cut off points are we need to test a fairly extensive range
8176526 our expectation from the first study is that the ferry can break even that it can cover its operating costs by fares
8176527 but well confirm that with the upcoming review of the business case based on this new market data
8176528 it costs us more to operate but it also increases the number of people who want to take the service so it pretty much evens out in the end
8176529 its a contract for both designing and building the vessels and most groups do either design or build
8176530 so they have to make partnerships in order to bid on that and that takes some time
8176531 theres a substantial amount of information we have yet to see
8176532 my understanding is there was a boyfriend girlfriend relationship between the accused and victim of the alleged assault
8176533 the only thing i can comment on at this time is that it appears the assault had taken place before the actual homicide took place

8176537 in the lack of certainty about an election date it falls to the government to create that certainty
8176538 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty
8176539 its not a matter of polls as you know the polls arent particularly wonderful
8176540 its a matter of my responsibility as prime minister to make a decision on whether i think the fall session of parliament can be productive certainly spending weeks and weeks playing telephone tag with guys to set up the meetings with opposition leaders doesnt help me confirm that things are going to be very productive
8176541 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in a space of a few weeks

8176549 it appears to the government that the liberal caucus is desperate to score political points off the backs of what is really a tragic event

8176589 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8176590 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8176591 we know that president obama will end the war in iraq responsibly bring our troops home and begin to repair our alliances around the world
8176592 this race is all about the future that is why we must elect barack obama as our next president because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas when we put solutions over stalemate and when hope replaces fear
8176593 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 men and 15 women
8176594 this matter is of grave concern to the united nations we have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8176595 we share the same common goal as the iraqi government and that is to turn over more and more of the security responsibilities to the iraqi security forces
8176596 thats proceeding well but at the end of the day nothing changes from the fact that we believe strongly that the withdrawal of u s forces of coalition forces ought to be based on the conditions on the ground and what we are seeing is a dramatically improved situation in iraq with respect to security and an ever increasingly capable iraqi security force

8176616 im studying the effect knowing that your voting is public has on participation

8176627 the data here clearly show as they did in a national study we conducted earlier this year that a site based on information from a local mls will give consumes a more accurate picture of whats available in a local market
8176628 are still struggling to collect a comparable comprehensive data set of accurately displayed listings
8176629 until now very little research has been done on listing accuracy a key demand of todays online shopper
8176630 understanding that web sites get their listing information from a variety of sources we were interested in knowing the differences
8176631 wav group research established that searchable housing information on idx powered web sites is the most accurate public home search available usually 96 percent to 98 percent accurate
8176632 clearly brokers and agents are looking to promote seller listings online in the best possible way to reach as many buyers as possible unfortunately the process in place today for getting accurate and complete listing information to third party web sites is an awesome challenge

8176691 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8176692 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8176693 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8176694 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8176695 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8176696 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8176697 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8176698 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8176699 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8176700 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8176701 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8176702 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8176703 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8176704 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8176705 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8176706 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8176707 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8176708 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8176709 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8176710 the way they are acting it must mean they are desperate
8176711 our rationale is that we dont want customers to get in a situation where they cant afford their outstanding commitment
8176712 the largest banks are trying to limit their exposure to housing in general
8176713 but the delinquency rates have been rising for the last several quarters
8176714 it does represent a hardship for customers and we recognize that
8176715 pnc has always managed its home equity lines of credit based upon a borrowers ability to pay and we continue to believe this is the most relevant predictor of repayment
8176716 this touched a nerve with me because i find it kind of underhanded
8176717 im stuck i dont know what im going to do with st joes i have to contact their bursar and see what kind of arrangements we can make
8176718 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8176719 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8176720 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8176721 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8176722 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8176723 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8176724 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8176725 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8176726 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8176727 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8176728 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8176729 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8176730 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8176731 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8176732 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8176733 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
8176734 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8176735 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8176736 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8176737 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8176738 this is the biggest bid that i have ever made i am quite confident that it will go through
8176739 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8176740 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8176741 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8176742 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8176743 no one works for someone we all just work together
8176744 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8176745 they want to escape the pressure of the funding markets
8176746 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8176747 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8176748 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8176749 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8176750 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8176751 regrettable and we reaffirm our attachment to georgias territorial integrity
8176752 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8176753 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8176754 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8176755 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8176756 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8176757 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8176758 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8176759 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8176760 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8176761 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8176762 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8176763 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8176764 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8176765 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8176766 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8176767 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8176768 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8176769 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8176770 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8176771 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8176772 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8176773 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8176774 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8176775 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
8176776 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8176777 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8176778 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8176779 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8176780 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8176781 i dont think the total decision should revolve around whether theres a sign on a building
8176782 the system is functioning the way it is supposed to and we are restoring integrity to the zoning process
8176783 the bulk of our conversations had not been about signs
8176784 i think its a bad decision for the city and it will reflect poorly when businesses look at working deals out with the city
8176785 if you cant even make a deal business dont want to fluff around with that nobody wants to sit around and negotiate with someone who cant make a deal
8176786 it will potentially weaken the mayors ability and commerce directors ability to attract business although its not the end of the western world
8176787 hardly any new homes are being sold but at least the sales pace seems to be hitting a bottom
8176788 a rise in new home sales in july looks like good news on the surface after all most analysts had expected a decline
8176789 this is a necessary adjustment to bring the market back into balance
8176790 it will take another year perhaps two to work off all that inventory but at least it is no longer rising
8176791 the housing crash is not over but the bottom is finally coming into view
8176792 the good news is that while year on year price declines continue to set records the steepest price declines are behind us and some markets have moved up over the past few months
8176793 this helps a lot just the confidence the guild has given us in this vote means a lot
8176794 its 25 a week thats five bucks a day i think thats an appropriate sacrifice
8176795 a seasonal tweak to account for a lower traffic period
8176796 we take issue with the states characterization of our conduct and the parties voluntary settlement
8176797 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
8176798 overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
8176799 exhaustively documented all our spectrum holdings at amp t seems to be a little upset that someone should have more wireless spectrum than at amp t
8176800 the year 2008 will be drastically worse than 06 or 07
8176801 the numbers for this year will see a rise in poverty
8176802 i have to be honest with you 2006 and 2007 were bad but not as bad as this year
8176803 people are struggling more than in 06 theyre struggling double
8176804 they understand as long as they get the birthday cake
8176805 theyre coming here to save some money to pay their bus pass to fill their gas tank
8176806 the gap between the rich and poor will become bigger
8176807 and we expect the inequality numbers in pennsylvania to get worse
8176808 i expect poverty will go up in every one of philadelphias suburban counties when 2008 numbers are calculated
8176809 the decrease in philadelphias poverty seen between 2006 and 2007 will be erased
8176810 they are behind and their children may be terminated from the program because they cant pay 20 a month for day care
8176811 id go on interview after interview a resume without a college degree didnt help
8176812 for mums who work used to work or want to go back to work one day as if looking after children isnt work enough
8176813 samanathas read a few books about it because shes really interested in it but the main thing you do is talk with friends comparing and contrasting i think the problem lots of parents have is they dont have people to talk to they dont have their parents to help them out or the wider social networks people who could say you know that giving them chocolate at 10 oclock well it might not be the best idea in the world
8176814 i dont think the total decision should revolve around whether theres a sign on a building
8176815 the system is functioning the way it is supposed to and we are restoring integrity to the zoning process
8176816 the bulk of our conversations had not been about signs
8176817 i think its a bad decision for the city and it will reflect poorly when businesses look at working deals out with the city
8176818 if you cant even make a deal business dont want to fluff around with that nobody wants to sit around and negotiate with someone who cant make a deal
8176819 it will potentially weaken the mayors ability and commerce directors ability to attract business although its not the end of the western world
8176820 the government has spooked everyone into thinking that we need nuclear by saying theres going to be a terrible energy gap the lights are going to go out in the middle of the next decade
8176821 within 24 hours it will be omitted from our web site please use the original e mail adress of your company when sending the e mail
8176822 within 24 hours it will be omitted from our web site please use the original e mail adress of your company when sending the e mail
8176823 our businesses have started the second half of the year well and this together with our continued emphasis on cost control leaves us well placed to meet our expectations for the full year
8176824 we are going to be looking for the guys to come out enthusiastically
8176825 this could be a historic win and a big plus for this program i am sure it would help the guys realize that they can go out there and compete in 11 man
8176826 offensively we are going to use our speed to get to the outside
8176827 we are a passing team and we are sticking with what we know our goal is going to make them come out of their defense so that we can run up the middle as well
8176828 we are using an offense that weve been working on for the last five weeks
8176829 on saturday at a scrimmage this offense scored five times we had some hiccups with dropped passes and bad snaps but when we ran our plays without mistakes we were able to execute we feel like we are on schedule and have had some long practices in order to catch up
8176830 i didnt have any clue or know anything about six man football and boy that is a wild game
8176831 i told my boys what it was and we started working preparing for a lot of receivers going out i think it is going to be like arena football last year we did play beaumont legacy and bay area christian two schools that have spread offenses
8176832 they have a new coach and new assistants but are returning six players from last year
8176833 size wise we matchup with them pretty good but they have a couple of running backs that are pretty quick their offensive line is small but their quarterback is very talented
8176834 bradley scored four or five touchdowns a game last year because he is so quick
8176835 josh is a pretty good passer as well so we will try to get those two the ball as often as we can we are still learning as we go but i believe we can tire them out with our speed
8176836 they pretty much play 11 man with a six man team by using different runners to tire you out with those big guys up front
8176837 but i am looking for our defense to get some containment on them if we can keep them down to 30 points we will be able to win most games because we score 40 to 50 points a game
8176838 the baby is healthy he is breathing on his own mum is jetlagged but stable
8176839 i got the operative end one got the comforting end the breathe breathe breathe end and the other got the looking after the baby end
8176840 there were four of us one surgeon one orthopaedic surgeon one kidney specialist and a humble gp who was the only one whod done very much in the way of deliveries so i got that end
8176841 i think we all had fun once we knew it was all safe
8176842 she was fortunate enough to have doctors on board the flight
8176843 dad is over the moon and he has rung grandparents back in india to tell them the news
8176844 we are hoping to reunite mother and baby this afternoon

8176861 late payment is on the rise according to our research with more than half of respondents saying it has become more of a problem over the last 12 months
8176862 the government should be doing more both by paying on time itself and by implementing measures to tackle the problem without increasing the burden of legislation faced by small firms
8176863 the research shows that worrying trends are emerging supplier abuse appears to be widespread and many smaller firms are in a catch 22 situation fearing that if they take action and use the legislation to charge interest these larger companies will simply refuse to deal with them again
8176864 a change to contractual terms cannot be made unilaterally this is a simple matter of contract law
8176865 suppliers should be careful about fulfilling orders received after this letter was sent since to do so may indicate acquiescence and therefore acceptance of the new terms the letter seeks to impose

8176888 kami meyakini bahwa fenomena yang terjadi di alam semesta tidak memiliki permulan azali dan tidak akhir abadi menurut kami alam semesta ini senantiasa ada dan qadim tidak huduts kami datang kemari untuk membahas persoalan ini apabila anda sepakat dengan kami maka jelas bahwa keyakinan kami yang unggul dan sekiranya tidak demikian kami akan menentang keyakinan anda
8176889 apakah anda meyakini bahwa fenemona semesta tidak berpermulaan dan abadi senantiasa ada
8176890 iya beginlah keyakinan kami lantaran kami melihat tidak ada permulaan bagi alam semesta ini dan demikian juga kami tidak melihat kefanaan dan akhir darinya kami menghukumi bahwa fenomena segala kejadian yang terjadi di alam semesta ini senantiasa ada dan demikian seterusnya
8176891 saya ingin bertanya kepada anda dari sudut pandang lain apakah anda pernah melihat keazalian dan keabadian setiap benda di alam semesta ini
8176892 kami tidak mengklaim demikian bahwa kami melihat keazalian dan keabadian seluruh maujud
8176893 kalau demikian adanya anda jangan menilai dari satu sisi saja karena dengan pengakuan anda sendiri kalian tidak pernah melihat keazalian maujud juga tidak pernah melihat keabadiannya lalu bagaimana kalian dengan melihat satu sisi saja membuat kesimpulan dan berkata karena kami tidak melihat keabadian dan keazalian maujud maka seluruh maujud dan fenomena yang ada adalah azali dan abadi
8176894 apakah kalian melihat siang dan malam yang senantiasa saling bergilir satu dengan yang lain
8176895 apakah kalian melihat siang dan malam sedemikian sehingga keduanya senantiasa ada semenjak dulu dan akan senantiasa ada
8176896 menurut anda apakah ada kemungkinan siang dan malam berkumpul pada satu tempat mekanisme perputarannya tidak berjalan sebagaiman mestinya
8176897 kalau demikian adanya keduanya terpisah satu dengan yang lain ketika giliran salah satunya selesai berpindah giliran kepada yang lain
8176898 kalian sesuai dengan pengakuan kalian sendiri sampai pada kesimpulan tentang terciptanya pergiliran siang dan malam tanpa kalian melihatnya oleh karena itu kalian jangan mengingkari kekuasaan tuhan
8176899 apakah sesuai dengan keyakinan anda siang dan malam tidak memiliki permulaaan azali qadim atau memiliki permulaan hadis apabila kalian berkata memiliki permulaan maka hal itu merupakan bukti bagi kehudusan fenomena semesta dan apabila kalian berkata tidak memiliki permulaan maka perkataan ini meniscayakan sesuatu yang tidak memiliki akhir tidak memiliki permulaan ketika siang dan malam dari sisi akhir terbatas akal sehat berkata dari sisi akhir juga akan terbatas dalil keterbatasan akhir siang dan malam adalah keduanya terpisah bergilir satu dari yang lain
8176900 kalian berkata alam semesta adalah qadim azali apakah kalian memahami keyakinan ini atau tidak
8176901 apakah anda melihat bahwa seluruh maujud di alam semesta ini satu dengan yang lain saling bertautan dan dalam keberadaan mereka saling memerlukan sebagaimana kita melihat pada satu bangunan bagian bagianya batu semen cat tanah masing masing saling bertaut dan untuk bertahan saling memerlukan satu dengan yang lain tatkala seluruh bagian alam semesta demikian adanya bagaimana mungkin kita memandangnya sebagai sesuatu yang qadim dan tetap 2 apabila bagian bagian ini yang saling membutuhkan qadim bagaimana sekiranya ia hadis

8176904 very strange its realistic but it has special effects its a mix between cronenberg and i dont know what um the dardenne brothers
8176905 but it is easier to show someone who is not a genius a bad painter rather than a picasso for me its not important that angel is a poor writer whats important is her energy her will her strength i think angel has a gift but her problem is she becomes popular when she is too young it happens all the time barbara cartland was a success with this shit that she writes and she never changed maybe if shed been a big flop she would have become emily bront
8176906 he asked me is it because your film is low budget that all your special effects are so bad i said its a choice its to explain the disconnectedness of the characters some people dont understand that they havent seen those old films which look like that they are used to harry potter and the lord of the rings where the effects are perfect i realized at that point my film was complex before that i thought it was mainstream maybe its mainstream for people who are 60 years old or for gay men i dont know if you dont have that perspective maybe it seems too strange too perverse when i make a film i always assume the audience is clever
8176907 thats why i like her i love monsters i know everyone wont like her but for me shes very touching i think romola is so clever she understood the part completely she said angel is a character shes acting her life we are all acting but with angel its more extreme
8176908 with melvil poupaud who played a photographer dying of cancer in time to leave i felt like he was an actress he was very easy to work with as was michael fassbender in angel they had no problem being directed by a man
8176909 many many men have that problem they cant accept their feminine side it becomes this big fight and sometimes its boring i want to work not fight
8176910 it was a dream of me i didnt actually kill my parents only in the film
8176911 i recognise myself in her as this child living in her dreams

8176916 russia is a state which has to ensure its interests along the whole length of its border this is absolutely clear
8176917 will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8176918 looking at a variety of options with regard to consequences for russias aggression in georgia
8176919 todays announcement further inflames an already tense situation in the region
8176920 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
8176921 we again call on russia to abide by international law as the basis for resolving this crisis and to implement urgently and in full russias commitments to withdraw forces
8176922 we fear a war and we dont want one if its hot we dont want it
8176923 the current atmosphere reminds me of the situation in europe in 1914 when because of one terrorist leading world powers clashed
8176924 i hope mikheil saakashvili the georgian president will not go down in history as a new gavrilo princip
8176925 saakashvili chose genocide to solve his political tasks the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have more than once spoken in referenda supporting the independence of their republics we understand that after what had happened they have the right to decide their fate themselves
8176926 i dont think we should really be afraid of isolation
8176927 i dont think isolation is looming i dont believe this should really be a doomsday scenario i believe common sense should prevail
8176928 some people in the west have been in denial for a long time
8176929 now there can be no more denial the west has to show that this will cost them really cost them you are dealing with bullies here and bullies do not understand the tender message

8176938 the way the emergency department is running at the moment is fast going from critical to dangerous and this has been communicated to north coast area health on a number of occasions
8176939 its a hospital not a hotel and you get surges of demand from time to time
8176940 when youre working at an occupancy rate close to 100 per cent you dont have to be a rocket scientist to work out demand surges cant be met and you get bed block
8176941 it is an ongoing problem with the ed at the hospital we have been highly concerned for some years
8176942 the community has been fighting to finally get a new ed but earlier this year we were told stage three is not planned for the near future
8176943 of high concern is that not only the medical practitioners but the staff and allied services at the hospital have conveyed to me their concerns in relation to what theyre faced with in the emergency unit
8176944 it reinforces the need for us to continue to get the government which might also include the federal government to commit to stage three of the hospital
8176945 i understand lismore base hospital experienced a very busy morning and early afternoon yesterday
8176946 i am advised only a small number of people arrived by ambulance and were cared for appropriately while they waited to be transferred to the emergency department
8176947 i am additionally advised that by mid afternoon the hard working doctors and nurses of lbh had cleared the backlog of patients
8176948 a larger emergency department is a key part of the lismore base hospital stage three planning strategy
8176949 experienced a very busy morning and early afternoon on tuesday august 26 with a surge of patients
8176950 ambulances patients awaiting transfer to the ed are in a clinically managed environment and there were no adverse consequences as a result of the delay

8176953 this season we are privileged to have been entrusted with the sale of the imperial seals from the estate of mile guimet and it is the first time that objects from this most celebrated collection come on to the market the seals represent an extraordinary counterpoint to the two qianlong imperial scrolls that we will offer for sale which symbolise respectively the emperors military might and his supreme cultural achievements and are both unrivalled masterpieces in the field together the seals and the scrolls represent the most tangible legacies of this emperors power
8176954 it is through our father that we learnt about our great grandfather but also through his letters and his numerous travel accounts we have always lived in the family home at fleurieu our collection of seals was always kept in the family dining room where we ate our meals they were carefully placed in a fine 18th century dutch cabinet instead of porcelain which is kept there today one could say that they were part of our daily lives our research has made us love them first of all for their aesthetics for the fine sculpture and the quality of the jade material and then for their strangeness which were most often dragon heads and now for the tremendous imperial history that they represent and for the great influence of the emperor qianlong
8176955 i have been particularly blessed by heaven which is why i had the tianen baxun zhibao seal carved to express my gratitude to heaven

8176962 here in lismore you can easily spot of 40 species of weedy vines groundcovers shrubs and trees just by taking a short walk around town
8176963 many of these weeds are running rampant in local backyards so we want to raise awareness among residents about what species to look out for and encourage landowners to replace weeds with native plants
8176964 lismore is one of the states poorest areas yet has one of the states dearest councils in terms of rates
8176965 so that we do not find ourselves with another mcleans ridges fiasco
8176966 that means people who will be out of their council area interstate or overseas on election day should arrange for a postal or pre poll vote so they can exercise their democratic right and to also avoid a fine for not voting
8176967 electors particularly those in isolated areas are encouraged to apply as soon as possible in order to avoid any delays in postal delivery that could render their vote invalid
8176968 in order to cast a valid vote residents or patients must be enrolled in the local government area where the institution is located or make a postal vote if they are enrolled elsewhere
8176969 can welcomes all to attend this important opportunity to hear from the people who may hold the future of our local government area in their hands and to question them on the issues important to you

8176975 no one wants a six pack of any kind on council

8176977 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus and the department has begun this assessment
8176978 one of the most important things we can do is to change our shopping habits because in an average household shopping accounts for over half of all household greenhouse emissions
8176979 it is not always easy to work out how to shop smarter and this new research by our students will make this easier and test consumer response to labelling
8176980 our labels indicate carbon emissions up to the time of sale obviously it is preferable to use a product with lower emissions but after sale behaviour can make a big difference to the whole of life greenhouse footprint
8176981 your decision to drive or walk to the store to make a special trip or to combine shopping with other errands to bring your own bag and to dispose of or recycle containers will all make a difference to the overall emission burden
8176982 if you prefer a black label product you can compensate in other ways but if you have no particular preference do something good for the environment and buy a product with a smaller footprint

8177000 gustav could regain hurricane strength wednesday or thursday once it clears the southwestern peninsula of haiti
8177001 more significant strengthening is forecast on thursday when it passes between
8177002 if gustav is able to thread the needle passing through the yucatan channel into the gulf of mexico it could intensify to category 4 or 5 strength over the warm water in the gulf
8177003 gustav should pass between jamaica and the southeastern coast of cuba
8177004 its obviously been a factor playing on the minds of oil markets at the moment

8177012 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8177013 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8177014 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8177015 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8177016 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8177017 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8177018 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8177019 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8177020 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8177021 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8177022 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8177023 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8177024 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8177025 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8177026 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8177027 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8177028 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8177029 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8177030 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8177031 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8177032 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8177033 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8177034 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8177035 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8177036 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8177037 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8177038 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8177039 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8177040 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8177041 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

8177044 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8177045 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

8177051 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8177052 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8177053 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8177054 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8177055 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8177056 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8177057 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8177058 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8177059 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8177060 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8177061 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8177062 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8177063 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8177064 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8177065 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8177066 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8177067 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8177068 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8177069 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8177070 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8177071 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8177085 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8177086 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8177087 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8177088 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8177089 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8177090 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8177091 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8177092 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

8177130 its because im short isnt it but no it wasnt
8177131 my profile is created at a us based millionaire dating site i met quite a lot of interesting guys and it helped me decide what i did and didnt want from a relationship
8177132 i didnt meet anybody i thought was really weird they were fairly nice guys but i was careful to meet in a public place and tell people where i was going
8177133 i never put myself in any danger and the guys were normal to a certain degree they just didnt suit me
8177134 then i got this really nice email from a guy who looked normal there wasnt any weirdness and we liked talking about the same sort of things
8177135 if you are on the right place i think you can find somebody if youre careful and do it right but i do worry about young girls who get themselves into tricky situations and perhaps arent old enough or wise enough to get themselves out of it
8177136 i wasnt really into going to pubs and clubs and none of my friends had any for me i had a few workmates at the time who were having a go on the internet and i thought what have i got to lose
8177137 if i thought they sounded interesting i sent them a hi message and something most women dont seem to do i was keen to meet them quite quickly
8177138 i wasnt into the whole chatting online forever because my theory was worst case scenario we meet and dont hit it off i still have an ok sort of date get to meet someone new have a nice meal and nice conversation
8177139 i dont believe theres any way the virtual world can really represent who someone really is
8177140 no one turned up and went ew yuck how revolting

8177223 after beijing i thought i might not be able to compete here and i really tried to do everything possible for my recovery
8177224 im a very big competitor so obviously i want myself to win but i think at the moment its a lot to ask for i just want to take it match by match
8177225 this match is definitely going to help me because it was very challenging i was sad i was 4 2 up and had a couple break points and everything was looking fine i just dropped my concentration for a moment and then it was very hard for me to get back into the game so definitely a match like is going to help me in the next rounds obviously i was missing a lot of my match practice so i got a tough one today
8177226 it made me angry because the whole reason that we asked that this woman not be pursued criminally for what she did to these fellas is we felt sorry for her and we felt to some degree she had been victimized by the process and she was very sick

8177232 we suspect we will get little information on the once a week byetta filing and the call will focus more on byetta with the most important points being the monotherapy indication label revisions on pancreatitis safety concerns and whether a risk evaluation and management plan will be implemented and whether that is restrictive to use

8177263 the five point harness system takes the force of a crash and spreads it evenly across the strongest point of the childs body and does it better than the three point system does
8177264 putting your weight into the car seat is what makes the difference as you are pushing it down into the seat of the car and it tightens it up
8177265 you cant take a child and put him in twisted straps and expect it to evenly distribute the weight during a crash the force of the crash you cant do it when it is twisted like that

8177305 superior to xbrl tagging of information for other forms of disclosure
8177306 the tagging and taxonomy requirements under xbrl for the more free form non financial disclosure may be formidable in the extreme
8177307 we are also concerned that extending xbrl to non financial disclosure would add to the cost of the disclosure system could raise difficult issues regarding the legal liability that might arise in the event of a contested xbrl tag and would fail to provide for the flexibility inherent in the questionnaire driven approach
8177308 its important to keep in mind that data tagging that makes information interactive isnt just about numbers its about words too or it could be about pictures graphs anything that you like can be tagged this way
8177309 a more efficient process would promote a direct to database design that would make it easier and cheaper for registrants to provide the necessary information and for users to analyze the information provided by registrants an online questionnaire is we suggest the most efficient means of achieving this objective
8177310 although the proposed on line questionnaire can take many different forms we presently conceptualize the questionnaire as being composed of a combination of binary yes no responses pull down menus numeric fields and textual responses information corresponding to current 10 k disclosure requirements would be updated annually information corresponding to current 10 q disclosure requirements would be updated quarterly and information corresponding to that now required by form 8 k would be updated on the occurrence of specified events
8177311 ideally the databases generated by this online disclosure regime would include audit trails that allow easy identification of the date and content of any modification thereby allowing users easily to reconstruct any filers disclosure history as to any disclosure item it would then for example be easy to track the history of changes in any filers description of its own business risk factors or any other disclosure item
8177312 the experience of the online community in developing open source code and wikis is we believe salient though alien to the legal community and to the administrative process this preliminary description of an on line questionnaire driven disclosure regime is intended to provoke among securities lawyers and regulators the sort of open discussion debate and commentary that is the norm in the internet community and that can help build a more efficient disclosure regime that reduces costs for filers while improving the quality of information available to investors

8177315 as a western business journalist odcs seemed mysterious questions filled my head such as how an odc actually operates and how two teams of engineers on opposite sides of the globe can be able to work together to create a successful product
8177316 i was honored to have an opportunity to visit this state of the art facility in pudong on the eastern side of chinas most vibrant commercial city
8177317 hayden phoned jim speedsmarts u s vp of engineering to discuss recruiting efforts speedsmart was a long time client and hayden has had conversations with him before
8177318 but part of building a team for our customers of course requires us to find the team
8177319 we went into the conference room where the rest of the magicimage odc team a total of six was sitting and dialed into a u s bridge
8177320 by listening to the discussion i could tell both teams understood the system equally well and had formed a close relationship
8177321 he took me to the magicimages odc area where vivian explained to me how the complex system works i didnt understand much
8177322 the process involves requirements specifications system modeling and analysis design build test iteration project acceptance and delivery and postmortem
8177323 i asked hayden when he would go home he said he had another interview at 6 p m and he would leave after it concluded
8177324 three reasons recruiting network service orientation and cost savings very often the talent they need is not something they can recruit easily to their satisfaction or within a meaningful time frame
8177325 the change of season calls for a change of scents
8177326 the light smells of summer are replaced with warmer scents as winter approaches
8177327 its time to make the switch from summer fragrances to warmer scents with notes of exotic flowers vanilla musk lavender fruits and spices
8177328 summers light crisp fragrances make way for more sensual and spicy smells
8177329 up until this point our humanitarian journeys were based on horseback rides
8177330 so many people over the years who werent horseback riders asked if i had trips in which they could participate the educational and medical relief mission is at the heart of what we do i wanted to share our experience with as many people as possible so i decided to re design our journeys and transport our riders by jeep
8177331 earlier this year i did a needs assessment trip to gujarat i learned that there are over 500 000 blind people living in the state of gujarat
8177332 i knew immediately that rwi could play an important role and that there would be many opportunities for our volunteers to not only have an extraordinary trip but to make an immediate and positive impact on the lives of those we will be visiting
8177333 i have already heard from several rri alumni riders who want to join us again for many of them the trip was a very powerful emotional and spiritual experience they learned about a new and rich culture in a very unique and deep way there is nothing quite like seeing the face of a small child receiving the unexpected gift of books and a soccer ball or watching a woman open her eyes and once again seeing the world around her

8177335 what do you want to do with the rest of your life
8177336 for me a phase of weakening and a progressive convalescence is the most likely scenario
8177337 after the german economy began the year with a bang that was to be expected i nonetheless foresee more than a simple correction
8177338 domestic demand in particular is developing less strongly than anticipated but this weakness will be temporary
8177339 weak banks should be allowed to disappear from the market
8177340 bad management must be sanctioned a rescue is justified only when there is a threat to the entire financial system
8177341 i must say the moldovan had the best defence among all the boxers in beijing he never dropped his guard during the bout
8177342 on the other hand akhil is a very fearless boxer and he plays with his guards down but thats his style technically there was no problem
8177343 he is a very emotional person and was really affected by the quarterfinal loss but put up a brave face to keep the spirits up in the camp he said so what if i have lost jitender and vijender have to accomplish the task and he kept himself upbeat for them
8177344 he always had the confidence and he now has the required experience and that made all the difference in 2012 he can definitely go for the gold
8177345 our goal for the 20th season is to display where we have been and the really exciting path we are on

8177349 the lounge is an extension of my donna toscana tuscan style line of chocolates

8177836 er is veel werk maar er zijn weinig banen onze gemeenten zijn te klein om overal een vaste rabbijn aan te stellen de nieuwe rabbijnen moeten daarom hun hoofdinkomen uit andere bron halen de vijf die nu van de opleiding komen doen dat ook al ze hebben tijdens hun studie in hun eigen levensonderhoud voorzien
8177837 voor het leiden van een synagogedienst heb je geen rabbijn nodig de meeste gemeenten runnen hun eigen diensten maar wie leidt de mensen op die de diensten moeten leiden daar is w l geschoold kader voor nodig ook het pastorale gebied is de laatste jaren ernstig verwaarloosd we hebben een nieuw gebedenboek dat verder ontwikkeld moet worden scholen doen verzoeken om lezingen en dan is er nog het beleid van het verbond waarbij de liberaal joodse gemeenten zijn aangesloten waarvoor ook de nieuwe rabbijnen verantwoordelijkheid moeten gaan dragen
8177838 ik geef veel lezingen over het jodendom voor allerlei groepen scholen in leerhuizen en interreligieuze verbanden en ik leid een verscheidenheid aan groepen rond in de haagse liberale synagoge de joodse traditie vind ik fascinerend maar waar in het land der blinden eenoog koning is voelde ik me niet meer dan een halfoog ik heb joodse les gegeven in de joodse gemeenschap maar vroeg me wel eens af of het allemaal klopte ik wilde graag meer weten me er verder in verdiepen daarom ben ik de rabbijnenopleiding gaan volgen een fantastische opleiding die voor honderd procent aan mijn verwachtingen heeft voldaan de kinderen waren net groot genoeg dus de opleiding kwam voor mij ook nog eens precies op het juiste moment een groot cadeau uit de hemel zo ervaar ik het ik hoop als rabbijn actief te kunnen zijn in een kleine gemeente mijn voorkeur gaat uit naar pastoraal werk en stervensbegeleiding ik zou graag een thuishaven zijn voor mensen een aanspreekpunt met een lage drempel waar ik kan helpen wil ik helpen met onze komst trekt er inderdaad een feminiseringsgolf door het liberale rabbinaat geweldig vind ik dat ik heb mijn hele leven gevochten voor de positie van vrouwen dit is de kroon op mijn strijd we zullen best wel hier en daar op weerstand stuiten een minderheid van de liberale joden heeft moeite met vrouwelijke rabbijnen maar de meerderheid is eraan toe in het buitenland zijn vrouwelijke rabbijnen in het liberale jodendom allang heel gewoon maar zoals rabbijn lilienthal pleegt te zeggen in nederland gebeurt alles twintig of zelfs vijftig jaar later drie rabbijnen zijn of gaan met pensioen de enige jongere is menno ten brink maar die kan niet het hele land bedienen de mensen zullen eraan moeten wennen ik begrijp de emoties wel maar we zijn nu eenmaal een liberale club als je er niet tegen kunt moet je maar naar de orthodoxen gaan we gaan vandaag allemaal in toga om het persoonlijke enigszins weg te halen en ook wel een beetje voor de status daaroverheen draag ik een heel bijzonder kleurig vrouwelijk talliet gebedskleed dat speciaal voor mij is ontworpen en gemaakt door de kunstenares jet naftani l jo l

8177846 la estrategia de putin y medv dev busca subrayar el contraste entre la respuesta rusa de 1991 y la de ahora primero para recordar que mosc ya intent la v a de la negociaci n segundo para demostrar que la ruptura del statu quo es responsabilidad de georgia y tercero y tal vez m s importante para dejar patente que la rusia de hoy no es la de entonces

8177851 est n obligados a defender la integridad de georgia un vecino democr tico al que se le debe abrir las puertas de la otan de manera urgente
8177852 es una lamentable consecuencia de la no menos inapropiada decisi n por parte de varios pa ses occidentales de haber reconocido la soberan a de kosovo sin un respaldo jur dico razonable

8177855 muchos de los errores de occidente surgen de su incapacidad para comprender las tendencias de opini n rusas la relaci n de fuerzas sobre el terreno y la mentalidad de putin el hombre que considera la desintegraci n de la urss como la mayor cat strofe estrat gica del siglo xx

8177857 poco puede hacer occidente ante los hechos consumados ni siquiera arrogarse la superioridad moral cuando eeuu y la mayor parte de la ue hicieron exactamente lo mismo en kosovo
8177858 sin embargo es evidente que washington y bruselas est n obligados a reaccionar si no quieren que la historia se repita en cualquier otro lugar de la inmensa frontera rusa
8177859 el inquietante interrogante ahora es si su belicosa actitud se dar por satisfecha con el desconcierto causado o s lo constituye la evidencia inicial de un plan m s profundo para tratar de regresar a un mundo bipolar
8177860 el problema es que el resfriado es fuerte y que los remedios no se adivinan con efecto a corto y medio plazo
8177861 hay motivos para sentir gran inquietud por un sector que hasta ahora pod a presumir de un crecimiento sano y sostenido

8177883 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8177884 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8177885 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8177886 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8177887 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8177888 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8177889 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8177890 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8177891 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8177892 barack and michelle listened and they understood it was like talking with family it became clear that they are regular people

8177902 e business by 2014 believes that eventually there will be a form of
8177903 movement towards a personal cash card not credit card is starting to begin when that day arrives payment processing for those looking to buy online gaming stuff will be extremely easy reliable and very fast
8177904 because i have a student credit card that allows me to make internet purchases without it id be paying double or triple for my books at the school bookstore whereas online i can find books second hand for a third of the price
8177905 weve got three players all vying for the same market search buy and process google and microsoft have the software and search technology while paypal boasts the most friendly payment processing online all the same google would probably prefer to vertically consolidate this process under their control while hopefully avoiding anti trust and or monopoly issues
8177906 older folks are skeptical of making purchases online fearing identity theft or unscrupulous retailers
8177907 but when they see others buying things with no problems they quickly opt to try it the newfangled way online
8177908 im excited to be starting up this new e wallet
8177909 because weve noted a huge demand for online gaming transactions online in order to meet this demand were going to need high end it and fresh programming platforms with these two elements teamed together we believe we can provide payment solutions for online gaming companies and many others
8177910 essentially we want fast processing but also very secure processing customer confidence is extremely important in the online gaming industry and we aim to be one of the top businesses in this market in order to do that business transactions must be clean
8177911 weve slowly moved away from check processing to credit card sales
8177912 mostly because check processing takes days and credit cards are almost instant further if the check bounces and weve sold a online gaming product it can take a month to track down the delinquent account holder and get our money back with credit cards its up to the respective bank to come up with the money
8177913 credit cards are quickly becoming the payment method of choice for most online gaming purchases because they are extremely convenient and relatively secure
8177914 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts
8177915 in general spatial relationships are not trypically meant for use in random numbers
8177916 but were trying new things now that could yield very promising results

8177924 ive got to collect the set and ill keep going until london thats for sure
8177925 we knew we were competitive but we didnt know how competitive we were so its wicked its probably still sinking in now
8177926 when a disaster happens youre going to have a whole lot of people who are going to need the things that we have and weve got to be prepared to defend them
8177927 every member every male must swear to a conduct and that is to love and protect their family
8177928 provide food clothes roof and be prepared to defend them even if it cost him his life
8177929 civil defence has always tried to drill people in this country to supply themselves and be prepared for these things and we just basically take it one step further
8177930 we go into the bush make up camps find food make sure weve got plenty of supplies a bit of training
8177931 how to light fires when its raining what to look for what kind of food you can eat what you cant eat
8177932 we have a lot of members who arent registered with us
8177933 voluntary firemen nurses doctors lawyers computer experts we have three or four hundred through the whole country
8177934 lo and behold bird flu might get here theres worldwide food shortages all around the world we might have stacks and stacks of people coming to invade here
8177935 theres no racial motivation at all because at the end of the day weve got people of all sorts of descriptions
8177936 we try and keep away from politics that was the idea
8177937 if there was a disaster people like that are going to be the ones who hit the streets and the average joe bloggs will have no defence
8177938 no way or surviving it will be the fittest and the dead
8177939 youve got one organisation using live ammunition and practising shooting down cars and youve got an organisation that teaches people to live from the land
8177940 you can have the best technology in the world and not know how to use it its the same in a survival situation
8177941 you can have all the food and so forth and if you dont know how to defend it and defend your children and your wife girlfriend youre going to lose
8177942 if the preverbal hits the fan you cant sit on a computer
8177943 and if you havent got something like that what are you going to do
8177944 our women are taught it our children are taught it youve just got to look at people who are attacked on the streets today ive done years of martial arts my daughters do it and i just think its something everyone should know
8177945 our children are growing up in a society where they sit in front of the tv and play playstation
8177946 i mean when i grew up you went outside and built huts and went eeling and things like that people are losing it and our children are losing it and this is where if a disaster happened unfortunately a lot of those people are not going to survive
8177947 some still sit in the house while waters flowing through the door
8177948 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8177949 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesn t think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks it s okay when women don t earn equal pay for equal work with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days they re awfully hard to tell apart
8177950 if you hear the dogs keep going if you see the torches in the woods keep going if theyre shouting after you keep going dont ever stop keep going if you want a taste of freedom keep going even in the darkest of moments ordinary americans have found the faith to keep going
8177951 weve been passing out the rights for 50 years and theyre capitalised in the land
8177952 in some regions if you get land that has access to water its probably worth 5000 to 25 000 hectare extra
8177953 this is nothing new the slope has been pretty slippery for the past 150 years
8177954 this is heading down the track of privatisation of water and creating ownership rights so it can be traded
8177955 the government would not support such a move as we believe water is owned by all new zealanders
8177956 it could overshadow the rights of ordinary people to have a say for example about rivers and streams they wish to swim or fish in and drink from
8177957 most acts of homosexual people are being done in dark corners and with corruption and paying bribes they will be kept there for a long time for it is not on the top of our priorities list which is occupied by issues of terror kidnapping and killing
8177958 i hope you can see how sensitive and very important the security issue is for the safe houses
8177959 the fall of saddam was the worst thing to happen
8177960 i would ask about women displaced people children and others before you get to that
8177961 these people are not welcome in the society because they are against the social natural and religious rules
8177962 ive already graduated from high school and i graduated from college theres nothing you can do to hurt me anymore

8177994 the lack of human capital in portugal has become a key obstacle to higher growth despite progress in the past decades portuguese children spend comparatively few years in formal education and they do not perform as well as children from other oecd countries adults especially the least educated do not participate enough in lifelong learning and training programmes this situation does not stem from a lack of resources devoted to education and training but from inefficiencies and misallocation of spending and weaknesses in the quality of the services that compound the low starting point of portugal regarding education modernizing the portuguese economy therefore requires a broad reform which increases human capital at all levels

8178079 studentii cauta pentru inchiriat in special garsoniere si apartamente cu doua camere deoarece acestea au cele mai mici preturi de pe piata precum si costuri de intretinere mai mici in plus la apartamentele cu trei si patru camere exista inconvenientul ca trebuie sa se grupeze mai multi in ceea ce priveste zona tinerii prefera sa si inchirieze locuinte in cartierele marginase unde preturile sunt mai mici sau in zone apropiate de unitatile de invatamant

8178081 piata terenurilor se transforma dintr o piata a vanzatorilor intr una a cumparatorilor acum doi ani se cumpara terenul ca o investitie astfel ca cel care cumpara se gandea ca pretul va creste si de aceea nu se gandea prea mult la pretul cerut acum cumpara fie cei care vor sa dezvolte un proiect fie cei care vor sa construiasca o casa si atunci cand fac o astfel de achizitie analizeaza pretul si cat de rentabila este o astfel de achizitie nu mai accepta orice pret
8178082 pana acum preturile au stagnat dar cred ca la 80 dintre terenurile oferite spre vanzare vor scadea
8178083 la terenurile pentru casa cred ca preturile se vor mentine deoarece o astfel de achizitie presupune un efort ceva mai mic probleme vor aparea din cauza infrastructurii pentru ca daca aceasta nu se va imbunatati nu vor mai fi multi cei dispusi sa aleaga o astfel de varianta si va scadea cererea

8178089 my profile is created at a us based millionaire dating site i met quite a lot of interesting guys and it helped me decide what i did and didnt want from a relationship
8178090 i didnt meet anybody i thought was really weird they were fairly nice guys but i was careful to meet in a public place and tell people where i was going
8178091 i never put myself in any danger and the guys were normal to a certain degree they just didnt suit me
8178092 then i got this really nice email from a guy who looked normal there wasnt any weirdness and we liked talking about the same sort of things
8178093 if you are on the right place i think you can find somebody if youre careful and do it right but i do worry about young girls who get themselves into tricky situations and perhaps arent old enough or wise enough to get themselves out of it
8178094 i wasnt really into going to pubs and clubs and none of my friends had any for me i had a few workmates at the time who were having a go on the internet and i thought what have i got to lose

8178096 i wasnt into the whole chatting online forever because my theory was worst case scenario we meet and dont hit it off i still have an ok sort of date get to meet someone new have a nice meal and nice conversation

8178150 omg who hires these guys by their thinking even my pet cat can become an analyst
8178151 omg who is the journalist that is quoting this guy why doesnt the journalist bother to find a real expert instead of waste time on these clowns who arent getting anything right oh i forgot journalists are too damn lazy

8178154 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men fifteen other villagers were wounded or otherwise injured
8178155 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
8178156 the patience of the afghan people has run out we no longer can afford to see the killing of our children
8178157 i want to remind all parties engaged in the conflict that the protection of civilians must be their primary concern they must respect their duties under international humanitarian and human rights law to protect the people we are here to serve
8178158 well shit ive got a way to go hes like 80 years old
8178159 we dont have much to gain from it japan is very tough on its agricultural tariffs and jpepa needs a multilateral deal not just an agreement between two countries
8178160 it should be beneficial and not just fashionable to the country
8178161 we all know that japan is incapable of producing young fresh and capable laborers in the next 10 years they will have a very aging labor force and without relocating to the philippines it will never survive economic competition
8178162 we negotiated but we did not get what we wanted
8178163 these are exactly the same commitments japan made under the world trade organization wto and there is no added provision in the jpepa there is nothing new in concession granted in the jpepa
8178164 we must determine the direction of where our country is going the direction is not being determined by our leaders but by external forces
8178165 this means that if we dont improve our production dont be surprised if japanese manufacturers here simply close shop and just import all their products
8178166 nagbobolahan lang tayo ditto we are just kidding each other here
8178167 jpepa is silent on fishery subsidies which endangers the livelihood of fishermen and puts at risk local agricultural stock
8178168 sengketa agraria di indonesia sebenarnya disebabkan oleh adanya monopoli lahan secara luas perkebunan perkebunan besar pemegang konsesi hutan atau hph serta perusahaan perusahaan tambang raksasa yang mempersempit lahan produksi petani
8178169 dengan karakteristik umum petani indonesia yang mayoritas adalah produsen pangan skala kecil maka kecil kemungkinan petani bisa memonopoli lahan yang bisa menyebabkan ketimpangan agraria dan melahirkan berbagai bentuk konflik sosial

8178178 and finally we must know that the territorial imperative just one it is true of the evolutionary forces playing upon our lives is the biological law on which we have founded our edifices of human morality our capacities for sacrifice for altruism for sympathy for trust for responsibilities to other than self interest for honesty for charity for friendship and love for social amity and mutual interdependence have evolved just as surely as the flatness of our feet the muscularity of our buttocks and the enlargement of our brain out of the encounter on ancient african savannahs between the primate potential and the hominid circumstance
8178179 the churchs teaching is that faith and the scientific evidence supporting evolution are not in conflict the theologians who went through the intellectual gymnastics required to come to that conclusion can only be pitied

8178188 i think the message to the public and future candidates is that negative campaigning doesnt work
8178189 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8178190 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8178191 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic
8178192 its going from bright ice to a much darker ocean
8178193 that allows for the breakdown of that by bacteria and other organisms that release co2 or methane depending on how the breakdown occurs

8178207 if you look at what the major countries have done to achieve significant results there is huge investment that goes into it
8178208 there is the issue of optimising the current funding we should ask what we can afford as a country and how we disperse those resources effectively
8178209 when i initially came onto the athletes commission i thought it was all sascocs fault but thats not the case the problems are multifaceted and therefore the solutions must be too
8178210 sascoc cant function if they dont get proper support from the government
8178211 we want to involve the athletes more in sitting down with potential sponsors so that they can see who it is that will be wearing their clothing and so on after all they dont want to sponsor an organisation but rather athletes
8178212 we athletes definitely need to be more directly involved in promoting the brand that is sascoc to potential sponsors

8178215 first our money the pound or the euro is very strong and because of that the turnover from those countries is heavier than they used to be
8178216 so for ubisoft turnover europe is actually more important than the us now and by more than 5 percent its become a very strong market for us
8178217 i think there are lots of customers that want to play because in europe we love to play the only problem we had was that the games were becoming more and more difficult to play

8178225 the fact that there are nine western warships in the black sea cannot but be a cause for concern they include two u s warships one each from spain and poland and four from turkey
8178226 the ruling was a political one rather than being judicial
8178227 the decision is an impediment to legislative power of parliament the court has negated parliaments will and moved out of the framework provided by the constitution we are ready for legal arrangements to protect parliaments legislative powers
8178228 the point that the court analyzed the constitutional amendments substance moving beyond procedural flaws was already made the need to revise the constitutions article 148 was then voiced we can elaborate more on these once the parliament opens
8178229 the constitutional courts legitimacy is questioned with this case a power dispute surfaced among constitutional institutions
8178230 the court ruled that the akp was a focal point of anti secular activities but did not shut it down it is a political risk for such a party to remain in power
8178231 turkey is still not on the road to normalization we are heading towards a twilight condition open to tensions
8178232 we have been following the same procedures for years whenever we decide to send objects to exhibitions held in foreign countries currently an object from a turkish museum is being displayed at the exhibition hadrian held at londons british museum and an expert we have sent there protects it the organizers of the byzantium 330 1453 were eager at the beginning but then they changed their attitude our experts are also responsible for reporting the daily condition of an object or objects when they are displayed at a museum in a foreign country staff from the royal academy of arts said they could not accept that and therefore they gave up asking for objects from turkish museums
8178233 ireland does not have the problem of forced sales as yet but our analysis of the stock of homes for sale does suggest a significant overhang of properties in the market
8178234 clearly to reduce this stock further price declines are needed with more extensive reductions in the areas with the most acute oversupply issues

8178239 the excessive pollution has occurred because of the waste from boats that anchor just 50 meters away from the shore and because of the fish farms located in the bay the lack of a sewage system is another cause no one can swim in the bay well continue to protest the situation until the authorities hear our voice
8178240 we cannot swim in the bay because of it we have caught various skin diseases so far i have put my villa up for sale i will not stay here any longer
8178241 they just take a shower and begin sun bathing we cannot suggest anyone goes to swim in the bay since it is terribly polluted we fail in explaining the situation to foreign tourists
8178242 pollution caused by wastes from boats and the fish farms near the islands of kiz and salih turned the aqua bay into a cesspool there are about 50 tourism facilities here in torba out of 5 000 visitors currently residing in the bay only a few can swim in the sea the pollution is spreading alongside the neighboring g ll k bay
8178243 seagulls are dying kids began getting diarrhea we have called the coast guards the district administrators office and the governors office but no officials have visited torba so far no examinations have been conducted and no precautions have been taken
8178244 no waste treatment facility has been built moreover boats have been permitted to anchor 50 meters away from the shore and stay there for days all in all wastes from these boats and surrounding islands have turned the bay into a rubbish heap
8178245 i do not understand why the authorities do not start to take action
8178246 if necessary precautions are not taken we shall have a demonstration with our swimsuits and bikinis on in front of the district administrators office and the municipality
8178247 citizens are right to rise we are working to find out what is responsible for this pollution we will get torba bay under control in 24 hours
8178248 in order for kazakhstan to withdraw from the btc it would have to renounce several agreements
8178249 a new process has begun in regard to the cyprus issue it should be resolved in a short period of time the cyprus issue doesnt have any indeterminate aspects
8178250 the position of the turkish side has remained intact for 30 to 40 years we want a solution to the cyprus problem based on political equality and turkeys guarantorship these are incontestable issues for us
8178251 we are unsure about the real intention of the greek cypriots
8178252 if they are running after image remaking without a content well go nowhere in talks
8178253 the annan plan overwhelmingly approved by the turkish cypriots also made a reference to single sovereignty citizenship for all cypriots
8178254 this appears to be contradictory because for alignment with the eu the lifting of the geographical limitation is a must
8178255 the turkish legislation on asylum immigration and foreigners will be aligned with that of the eu on the condition of maintaining the geographical limitation
8178256 what concerns us the most however is that the turkish policy toward asylum remains the same
8178257 asylum is an international human rights problem that should be handled outside any bargaining many weaknesses in the turkish asylum system are basically stemming from the presence of the geographical limitation
8178258 there is absolutely nothing to link hari puttar with harry potter
8178259 even if it does rhyme with harry potter surely there is a limit to cases
8178260 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
8178261 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted
8178262 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
8178263 since the united states is a permanent member of the security council this simply will be dead on arrival in the security council
8178264 turkey is being drawn into the picture but it is not even as influential as germany
8178265 we will disturb them if we are disturbed we know how to disturb them
8178266 my first big break was when i was five because i had learned to read and write i am sure prisons and asylums are full of people who cannot read or write
8178267 it took me more than 70 years to realize that
8178268 its that simple and its that profound i left school at 13 and had no formal education beyond that when i realized i wanted to become an actor and not a football soccer player i went out and got myself an education i read and i went to the theater
8178269 there is a lack of scottish history in our schools
8178270 it was always about english kings and queens scotland just didnt figure it was just about all things english
8178271 i didnt pay much attention to that i was more interested in how much money i made
8178272 the status was not something i was generally interested in or thought about
8178273 i saw donald trump in new york when he had just made the announcement of what he was going to do i said well that sounds terrific but i had not known what the local implications would be
8178274 i have come into a different cycle in my life since i decided not to do any more films i have a feeling that something is cooking something is afoot i dont quite know what it is yet
8178275 the total investment in the tarsus shopping center will be approximately 50 million euro
8178276 f rat and dicles return created excitement not only in turkey but also in the international arena
8178277 in 2008 we are going to track five bald ibises including f rat and dicle the data we are going to collect by these birds is very important for the bald ibises to survive in their natural habitats
8178278 i followed my dreams and will continue to sail and ride around the world to show the children that there is nothing they cant do
8178279 i talked to many children in rural areas of turkey via satellite telephone while i was in the middle of the pacific ocean
8178280 i am a mirror for their fears and i show them that there is nothing to fear
8178281 he is powerful inside and outside i am proud of him
8178282 the worst thing for a child is to realize that his dreams cannot become true
8178283 i watched a documentary when i was little and wanted to be an astronaut then i realized that all astronauts were americans so i cant be
8178284 adhan has its own musical mode so muezzins should perform it in compliance with it
8178285 because not all muezzins are trained and have nice voices they simply could not give the call with a harmonic voice five times a day with the introduction of the central broadcasting system each minaret has begun broadcasting the same unique version of azhan simultaneously
8178286 the number of preachers the religious affairs directorate employs is only 1 280 and there are about 80 000 mosques in turkey so we have to provide centrally broadcasted sermons in all mosques
8178287 not a green solution not a carbon safe solution and it will not make turkey energy secure
8178288 if we seem like we have nothing else to do it only shows our commitment to the cause and that we are giving up our free time for it
8178289 sinyad was established 1 5 years ago and in the 69 to 70 weeks since then we have held protests against nuclear energy every week at downtowns u ur mumcu plaza
8178290 even when we are in officially designated protest areas we still feel hostility from the security forces they surround us they record us their attitude is very negative
8178291 the penalty does not match the crime we are charged with resisting the police we never even had a chance to resist the police they arrived and with no warning at all tore the banners from our hands and took us away
8178292 dubai has emerged as the location of choice for foreign bankers
8178293 those fortunate to be working there in any financial discipline will probably enjoy a better bonus than their european counterparts in 2009
8178294 banks have the ability to ship people rapidly but its a reaction to a short term issue not a fundamental shift
8178295 most of the players are pumping huge funds into the banking sector in the hope of netting huge profits
8178296 political instability is not at all an issue in the near to medium term
8178297 we are not putting our toe in the water just to test the temperature
8178298 with the policies we implement and subsidies and incentive policies we expect to attain a yield of 4 3 million tons of corn this year this is a significant rise indicating turkeys capability to meet all its consumption from production
8178299 as the tmo we did not intervene in the price of corn in 2006 and 2007 we supported producers via a premium implementation both in corn and rice in the husk
8178300 our target is to see our citizens not bringing all products at hand to the market theyd better wait and draw advance payment if required
8178301 at present merchants purchase corn for 38 ykr our aim with advance pays is to see price maintenance the price will protect itself unless producers offer all their corn to the market at one time the payment of the purchased produce will be made to producers within 25 days
8178302 the announced price is far below our expectations considering prices of ykr 50 51 5 these prices are rather low for corn
8178303 considering increases in inputs the price should have been higher
8178304 where the 20 billion rand comes from in the sunday times only the sunday times and its reporters know were not facing claims from anybody
8178305 the bankruptcy of a parent tends to harm the credit of a subsidiary
8178306 banks may take a stern approach with asahi homes and it no longer has the option of asking the parent for help
8178307 it might appear that rio with its results slightly ahead of market estimates has done better than bhp
8178308 although we have seen some moderation in growth rates in developed countries the impact on our markets has been modest due to continued strong growth in developing countries
8178309 as with all real estate markets around the globe the australian market has been cooling its heels
8178310 the quarterly data we have shows a reduction in values across all sectors
8178311 dezvoltatorul a mai pastrat 50 de apartamente pe care nu vrea sa le vanda acum in rest am incheiat vanzarile
8178312 by 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars and we could be in a really resource hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in libya russia and saudi where natural gas is limited
8178313 it is those drivers those conditions which will encourage the possibility of landfill mining
8178314 there are some really buoyant prices around because plastic is all manufactured from oil so as the raw price of oil goes up every commodity derived from it goes up accordingly
8178315 several pilot studies have been carried out for research or pre feasibility studies in countries in europe but also in china japan and india
8178316 just imagine the resources that are lying in those landfills it could be incredible
8178317 but the insane thing is that we are talking now about investing millions into tapping into a resource under the ground when the real tragedy is that every week were still dumping tonnes and tonnes of plastic into more landfills its an act of vandalism against the environment

8178326 setelah dikaji segala segi yang berhubungan dengan pelaksanaan ekseksusi itu maka diambil kesimpulan untuk menunda pelaksanaan eksekusi itu
8178327 itu kan pernyataan yang sangat simpatik artinya jangan kita melaksanakan hukuman mati itu pada saat umat islam melaksanakan ibadah ramadan
8178328 menunggu saat yg tepat pada tahun 2008 konklusinya karena upaya hukumnya sudah penuh eksekusi itu pasti dilaksanakan tapi waktunya mencari waktu yang paling tepat agar tidak mempunyai ekses ke yang lain lain
8178329 pernyataan pak jaksa agung pun waktu itu tidak definitive hanya harapan bisa dilaksanakan sebelum masuk bulan puasa ternyata dengan pengkajian pengkajian yang dilakukan dianggap timingnya itu sekarang tidak tepat untuk melaksanakan pidana mati
8178330 yang pertama bulan puasa memberi kesempatan kepada umat islam semua termasuk saya
8178331 saya sudah telepon kejaksaan tinggi bali dan kejaksaan tinggi jateng untuk menyampaikan kepada mereka bahwa eksekusi itu kita tunda sampai waktu yang paing tepat

8178389 he definitely flirted with dannii throughout last years series but he seems to have moved on hes flirting with cheryl this year
8178390 yes you might say that hes definitely paying attention to cheryl now not dannii
8178391 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8178392 i liked the handle usually bats like that break easy this felt pretty durable
8178393 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year leveled off in july it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
8178394 if i had to tilt one way or the other like an airplane id tilt that way
8178395 it would be safe to say that im leaning toward that
8178396 the most important thing to me is us getting ready as a group and getting ready for miami
8178397 the more work he does with our guys in the group the better
8178398 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8178399 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8178400 i havent made any decisions yet on what direction im going to go as far as playing time
8178401 we will just wait until we get to the game day and i will determine how long i want everybody to go
8178402 those things happen and thats all part of the game
8178403 ive played in a lot of games and i hope that works to my advantage
8178404 i feel like ive gotten better on defense but special teams is where im going to make an impact
8178405 i feel comfortable with my assignments ultimately its up to the coaches but i have no regrets on how ive worked and the progress ive made
8178406 do i want him to have more reps yes i would love to have him in there
8178407 but thats the way it is he has to catch up when he can
8178408 within the world of basketball within those trail blazers teams he was a jokester
8178409 he was a big loving teddy bear at times guys got frustrated because he didnt have a mean streak
8178410 this is just one of those injuries that you have to take your time with
8178411 if you dont take your time with it youll have it the whole year
8178412 youve got greg youve got hank and we even worked jason avant in there a little bit this past game
8178413 i dont want to go out there and not be full speed
8178414 if im not full speed ill do what i have to do its strong and feeling good but its got a little ways to go
8178415 its kind of frustrating trying to pick up a position this late in the preseason
8178416 its like all right youve been doing this for a year and a half but now were going to try something different you have to start all over and get on the same page as guys who have been in there doing it so you know it is a little frustrating
8178417 he has to continue to take a step forward i need to see him be better than he was last week
8178418 im not going to say he was poor last week but i want to see improvement he is on his second week here so there should be marked improvement there
8178419 ive only been doing this for a week and a half it would be like me asking you how long it would take you to go be an astronaut
8178420 we are an insurance company whose aim is not to follow the market but to lead the market in every country that we operate we also aim for permanent consistent and a high level of profitability
8178421 teb sigorta is a dynamic creative young and promising firm that is why we chose to acquire it in our entry into the turkish market
8178422 as zurich sigorta we are looking into catching an aggressive growth trend in turkeys insurance market
8178423 this acquisition will bring dynamism to turkeys market when zurich financial services global knowledge and the local experience of teb sigorta are combined
8178424 we work on maintaining our profitability rate above 16 percent
8178425 no matter how many foreign investors have entered turkey in recent years the situation has yet to change
8178426 the unchanging grade of this rating is not just a problem for foreign investors it also is a problem for all newborn children in turkey
8178427 no matter what economic and social programs indicate i think management that would move turkey toward an investment grade would be successful
8178428 if some of the developing countries are overtaking us then we are relatively not advancing he said
8178429 apparently we will experience this process for a while furthermore turkey does not have many possibilities and also apparently has little intention to create opportunities from this period
8178430 at the most it could be the shallowness of financial markets the disruption of political and economic stability or that turkeys credit rating is not at an investment grade
8178431 other issues include the risks banks take in proportion to their strength and in line with their risk management principles and the banking authority is regulating and supervising these accordingly
8178432 we shifted to a slightly different policy as of the third quarter of last year from our previous aggressive growth policy we have shifted to a profit and customer focused strategy
8178433 our profit oriented strategy has kept us separated from the excessive and unfruitful competition in particular we abstained from high interest fixed deposits we did not take much of a chance with interest rates in loan interests as a result we only experienced market share losses of 1 2 points
8178434 however we displayed a competitive attitude particularly in our ytl balance sheet hence we were able to keep the balance between the interests we obtain and issue consequently our not pursuing an aggressive policy had a positive impact on our profitability
8178435 wont respond strongly as long as the medium term decline in inflation is not threatened and theres no clear disruption of general pricing behavior
8178436 i understand its only a matter of protocol a matter of procedure were working on one country which has some difficulty in this protocol but we think that its within reach
8178437 french baron de coubertin takes action to revive the old greek olympiads he invites world nations to gather in athens for mimicking the ancient grandfathers two years from now baron thinks these nations are apes is that so
8178438 some trainers are harming the spirit of contests by preparing clandestine nutrient regimes for the athletes and they earn more than athletes by doing so
8178439 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8178440 i think our organization was in favor of it i think its important to get those calls right
8178441 well go along with it im in favor of getting things right if it takes replay then i guess im for replay
8178442 what people dont understand is how it affects you sometimes
8178443 that definitely played a role in that game and then 2 nights later when the phillies lost again after a long rain delay that kind of buried us
8178444 at the same time weve had some go our way
8178445 its all about getting the call right i think thats what everybody wants
8178446 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8178447 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8178448 my opposition to unlimited replay is still very much in play
8178449 i really think the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8178450 i would limit this to in my personal view home runs fair or foul
8178451 i would not go beyond that i think its important to continue to have that human element of people making decisions on the field i think umpires should continue to be an important part of the game
8178452 people are just going to have to get people out
8178453 you define your own role i dont define them well just have to keep doing it until we figure it out and we will
8178454 a lot of times we like to blame one group or another but this was a team effort
8178455 we didnt hold them and we didnt add on weve had some tough losses this year but the sun will come up tomorrow and well play again
8178456 its frustrating to lose when youre ahead by that much
8178457 but in this team with this stadium its not enough this bandbox here is a good place for them to play
8178458 it can do nothing or it can do a lot well find out the next couple games obviously thats not the way you want the game to end after you have a 7 0 lead but well see what were made of
8178459 this is not the first time weve seen this and not just in philadelphia
8178460 it happens all over the place you have to keep playing hard right through the 27th out
8178461 we probably should try to stay away from him tomorrow
8178462 were having trouble scoring runs and everybody probably goes up there squeezing the sawdust out of the bats
8178463 i dont think theres any magic formula other than keep going out there and fighting the frustration we seem to be experiencing
8178464 id rather have that any night than no balls hit to me it makes it fun they can hit to me every time thats what i think thats what youve got to think i take a lot of pride in my defense
8178465 airstrikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
8178466 mission is based on a u n mandate and carried upon the invitation of the afghan government
8178467 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
8178468 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
8178469 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
8178470 of course why not if there is a suspension of military cooperation this is military cooperation
8178471 no one with common sense can expect to co operate with russia in one part of the world while acting against it in another
8178472 its not in russias interests for nato to be defeated and leave behind all these problems
8178473 wed prefer nato to complete its job and then leave this unnatural geography
8178474 but at the same time well be the last ones to moan about natos departure
8178475 not an inch is not a policy that has much to commend it in a dynamic europe that wants to move forward
8178476 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage
8178477 we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
8178478 we have to recognize however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
8178479 engaged with the public and produced an alternative document which sets out in detail the changes which need to be included
8178480 any proposal to re run the lisbon referendum is an affront to the democratically expressed will of the people
8178481 instead of wasting this money we could have provided a monthly income of ytl 3 147 to 68 million people
8178482 if we invested this money in industrial development we could have provided a source of ytl 150 000 for small and medium enterprises
8178483 in 2003 our internal debts were ytl 51 5 billion and in 2007 the amount went down to ytl 41 5 billion we appreciate the governments efforts but it is still not enough the money borrowed from internal sources goes into paying for other debts or covering the black holes
8178484 we need a change of mentality to prevent waste we need to strengthen turkey to increase our standards
8178485 let there be no mistake about it we are united
8178486 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity
8178487 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so
8178488 senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall
8178489 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
8178490 i wasnt sure clark was a good enough football player
8178491 but he was a good kid i thought maybe someday hed be a linebacker something like that i wasnt sure at all hed ever play quarterback for us
8178492 he was at kiski a week and he called me and said jay theres no girls here
8178493 we look at hundreds and hundreds of tapes and sometimes we cant figure out if we like someone or dont like him
8178494 and im talking about guys who have coached great players but i gotta say daryll clark surprised me
8178495 i just think that clark is a little bit ahead of the other two hes had a little bit more experience hes done everything weve asked of him i felt he was the best choice for our football team
8178496 jay was trying to get me to play clark more in 2007
8178497 i just didnt think it was right for morelli morelli was getting all kinds of hell from everybody and i didnt think it was fair i had a little loyalty to morelli
8178498 its sad because ive been a quarterback since i was 6 years old so i know what i can do
8178499 where you find out about somebody is when the games on the line 2 minutes to go youve got to drive the ball down the field to win it
8178500 our quarterbacks havent been in that situation yet itll be interesting to see how they react to it
8178501 i also want to be the guy whos there at the end when it counts
8178502 is there any reason any morality in collaborating and making amendments in the constitution with a party condemned of violating a fundamental principle of the republic
8178503 rodriguez said last month at the big ten media days in chicago
8178504 i mean what did i do i changed jobs thats all i did
8178505 after a while it was just stand in line and throw some more darts my way
8178506 im just anxious to coach football and let people judge me on that
8178507 i dont want to put a time frame to it other than sooner rather than later
8178508 but i will say this we want our guys to have a sense of urgency to be successful right away
8178509 our goal every year is to compete for a big ten championship i dont want to say ok well be able to do that in 2009 or 2010 we want to do that this year
8178510 we were not aware that jones was in the bay area
8178511 its a great way to win we pulled it out tonight
8178512 you forget that youre getting paid to play the game we almost felt like little kids with the excitement and kind of a playoff atmosphere
8178513 it was a lot similar to those games last year very much so
8178514 i think any time somebody pops off i think it catches some fire to it between the media and the fans and our players
8178515 i think our players hear that and they kind of take that to heart they get up and they get more determined and everything thats kind of like fighting words it kind of sets them off
8178516 if you notice we seem like we are in a more business frame of mind so that means we dont particularly want to associate with them i like that ive always liked that i think when we come to the ballpark when i put my uniform on were going to come out here and beat you i dont have any friends on the field when were playing weve got a couple guys like that and i really love that part about them
8178517 thats what i want really my birthday present is to win today
8178518 i dont want to get too amped because then i leave the ball up if i get too hyper and thats not me
8178519 just kind of relax a little bit and narrow my focus all that is going to happen once you get on the mound once the game starts its fine
8178520 i shall dream of a world where crapatacularone is more than just a human search engine or a free online spell checker
8178521 our goal is to find all of the americans living abroad in turkey and get them registered to vote we dont have a lot of time because in many of the states the deadline is sept 4
8178522 ill set up my computer and type their information for them
8178523 ill do anything because its so important there are a potential 12 000 votes in turkey and i think this election could very well be won by absentee ballots
8178524 my plan for being there is to learn as much as i can im so new to everything
8178525 were all patriots and we care about the future of our country as much as any american at home but since we live abroad we have a closer view to the effects of american foreign policy on our international image were on the front lines here
8178526 most of us that are here are concerned with the war because we border iraq whatever happens over there is going to affect us in some way
8178527 a new perspective and a new direction in american economic and foreign policy
8178528 the computer models are all over the place right now
8178529 its too early to theorize on galveston the potential is there but its too early to narrow down where it might go
8178530 these measures should help the process run smoothly as long as citizens do not wait until the last minute

8178539 the nordic and baltic regions are becoming ever more popular with business travelers
8178540 we are delighted that ipass has become teliasoneras first software based inbound roaming partner and thrilled with the success we have had in the region with blue chip enterprise customers such as nokia scania and the volvo group
8178541 we are thrilled to be working with lgc to bring fluidigms integrated circuit for biology to researchers in the uk

8178544 i think that it is no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
8178545 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
8178546 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8178547 this measure has been effective on aug 14 and related parties have been notified of it
8178548 north korea is trying to muddle through and delay as much as possible
8178549 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
8178550 i think the timing of the hu jintao visit to south korea was very depressing to the north koreans
8178551 i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
8178552 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
8178553 we are sad over nawaz sharifs decision we want to move together and solve the problems facing the nation
8178554 we will request nawaz sharif to return to the government
8178555 i dont anticipate it would have any impact on our joint efforts to combat extremism
8178556 within the worlds emerging economies millions of new businesses are demanding just the technology they need at the prices they can afford from a vendor they can trust today we answer that need by introducing new products that join our existing vostro product line
8178557 together with our partners dell will play an important role in bringing more technology to more people than ever before whether in business or in the public sector vostro is a key building block to unleashing the potential of the connected era
8178558 the need for fine tuning without bloodshed and within the framework of mutual compromise
8178559 we were expecting all that theres nothing to get worked up about obviously they are becoming much more agitated than we are
8178560 i wish nothing had happened however we used to lose over two thousand people per year between the years 1994 and 1999 this year that figure is around 80
8178561 the voice of people of kurdish origin who try to get their human rights
8178562 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8178563 a group of people who are doing this for leisure time and who have nothing better to do
8178564 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
8178565 unfortunately they were ignored also by nato and the un
8178566 this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity a principle based on the international law of nations and for this reason it is unacceptable
8178567 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
8178568 we consider that this is a regrettable decision and we reiterate our commitment to the territorial integrity of georgia
8178569 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
8178570 this is a great day in the history of our country and our people
8178571 this decision has no legal force russia will face harsh political consequences from this
8178572 the accused intending to exterminate in part a group of muslims participated in the forcible transfer of the muslim population with the aim to execute more than 7 000 men aged between 13 and 70
8178573 turkey gives importance to georgias independence sovereignty and territorial integrity and is deeply concerned over the latest developments
8178574 we trust justice and maybe we are doing paul pacuraru a favor
8178575 paul pacuraru is a current minister his credibility is the credibility of the entire cabinet
8178576 back to hannibal the return of tom sawyer and huckleberry finn
8178577 we fing too do not want to see the excessive deficit procedure launched but we do want to see additional measures being combined with something that will help solve long term problems rather than targeting temporary ones
8178578 the long term sustainability of public finances requires that additional measures are taken to effectively contain the rate of growth of primary expenditures and combat tax and social security contribution evasion
8178579 kosovo has a significant commitment from nato nato will stay in kosovo for a while as a guarantee for security
8178580 my feeling is that natos commitment to the balkans including kosovo is for decades probably
8178581 will it be the same size will it be the same way probably not
8178582 to start training and getting used to the nato way of doing business
8178583 how long this will take is difficult to say some years probably
8178584 but to reach that objective you need two basic conditions one is a good legal framework which is responsibility of the government parliament and the second key condition is security and stability
8178585 as kfor we are responsible for security and stability and we are committed to it
8178586 its a real struggle for power inside the orthodox church
8178587 its the nationalists versus the relative moderates its also about who takes the reins after the patriarch dies
8178588 bishop artemije stands as the sole obstacle to the kidnapping of kosovo
8178589 it is certainly between conservatives and less conservative forces inside the church
8178590 i dont think there is any positive prospect for macedonia without membership in nato and i mean quick membership in nato
8178591 its part of the progress and integration with europe that you all wanted therefore i think this should be your priority objective
8178592 the government should make clear its intention to solve the kurdish problem through democratic methods we are saying that you cannot solve this problem in the next five 10 years using weapons bombs
8178593 if kurds are not tolerated with democratic politics these people will feel excluded and segregated
8178594 the view i want to see is a dtp which is not closed a dtp which maintains its quest for reconciliation and dialogue

8178625 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood

8178627 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
8178628 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
8178629 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
8178630 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
8178631 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

8178636 theres a general strengthening in the us dollar that is being felt not just by the peso but also by other major currencies in the region
8178637 we all know that in the fourth quarter there will be an increase in foreign exchange inflow particularly due to the influx of remittances from ofws overseas filipino workers this will serve to support and stabilize the peso towards the end of the year

8178655 the bitter pill we had to swallow after the earthquake in 1999 seemingly had an immense effect on every level of the society but after nine years we see that nothing really has changed
8178656 there is an obvious example to that which is almost all of the decisions made in the council of earthquake since late 2004 there were representatives from public bodies universities or ngos in the council organized by the ministry of public works but the laws concerning the earthquakes have not been revised as they were planned to be then
8178657 pumps are destroyed in tahtal dam due to the water decrease we had to make water shortages we are sad to see that citizens are out of water so finally due to the heavy demand from the citizens we again opened the sar k z and g ksu reservoirs the water we will distribute until the purifications are completed will again increase the arsenic level but we dont want citizens of zmir to be experiencing a water shortage in these very hot days
8178658 according to the report from the health ministry that determines the arsenic level as 10 micrograms in one liter of water the citizens should not either drink the water or use it while cooking they can use the water while taking a bath or for their other needs
8178659 if there had been 30 million cubic meters more water in tahtal dam we wouldnt have applied this until the last moment we have tried to give the healthiest water to the city and succeeded to do this since june but currently through making the necessary warnings we are distributing the water containing arsenic to the water supply network

8178728 of course if you want to allow tennessee to remove big cities and the majority of its murders then you have to allow other states to do that as well otherwise you have unequal comparisons
8178729 what is it that makes red state cities so bad in these categories both when compared to other blue cities and to the non urban population within their own state
8178730 states x y and z voted for bush in 2004 states x y and z also have high murder and divorce rates therefore voting republican leads to murder and divorce
8178731 and one more disclaimer i am not certain that divorce should be seen as a sign of social dysfunction in any way shape or form many marriages suck people make mistakes staying married to stay married seems to me a much worse dysfunction that those who end and start a new and often better marriage
8178732 what is it that makes red state cities so bad in these categories both when compared to other blue cities and to the non urban population within their own state

8178794 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8178795 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8178796 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic

8178820 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8178821 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8178822 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8178823 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8178824 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8178825 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8178826 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8178827 my mother was born before women could vote but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8178828 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8178829 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights here at home and around the world
8178830 our defense was pretty strong and im proud of that
8178831 these three individuals were seen at the front gate of 8 croydon road very close to the time that xi zhou arrived home from work on 7 august
8178832 it is important for us to trace these three and speak to them as they may have important information
8178833 we were a little bit off the first half our touch was off our shots were a little bit off and we werent winning any 50 50 balls
8178834 i thought the second half we played 35 good minutes out of the 40
8178835 the first goal just made me want to score more
8178836 especially after they scored theirs i just had to score another one to close the game
8178837 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
8178838 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support
8178839 that sends the message to the kremlin that it risks international isolation
8178840 mr cheney is widely viewed by the russian political elite as the toughest hawk on russia in the
8178841 it hasnt gone unanswered in fact id say its been loudly answered
8178842 i dont think theres any question that russias reputation has suffered since it took these disproportionate military steps in georgia
8178843 theres no question that russia hasnt lived up to the cease fire agreement
8178844 was von den usa f r gut befunden wird das muss auch ich als moralisch richtig verkaufen und verteidigen eine eigene meinung habe ich dabei nicht geschweige denn einen objektiven standpunkt

8178870 if you have seen our league action our league action has been pretty good we dominated an everton side who finished fifth in the premier league on saturday
8178871 any win is nice but it wasnt to be tonight we wont dwell on it too long we move on
8178872 the premier league is our bread and butter and we are looking forward to every game we have started very well
8178873 as a manager who realises it is 38 games it is all about the performance for me and if we play as well as we have done we will win games
8178874 disappointment is the overriding factor of course they probably deserved the victory on the night and good luck to them
8178875 it was a disastrous result for us really but fair play to northampton because they came here set their stall out and made it difficult for us
8178876 weve spoke after the game and we cant be happy with that performance we know as players that we have let ourselves down as well as the gaffer the staff and the fans
8178877 this was a massive chance for us to go on and do something outside the premier league and maybe get into europe through this route
8178878 but it wasnt to be and now its all our attention to the league because thats all we have got until the end of december
8178879 i am back in moscow and i will not play in kiev and i can confirm i am going to tottenham

8178883 i do not know why we are always under pressure to buy 30 million or 40 million players
8178884 we can buy a robinho but we have not to look at chelsea or manchester united or liverpool we have to look at ourselves
8178885 we have no complex with the names the names dont impress me what is impressive for me is the attitude and the quality and all the rest is the media
8178886 i am under pressure to buy good players and good players are not always necessarily linked with the price of a player there is still a market to buy the right players we are struggling to find them but we will find them dont worry
8178887 we have the required squad and i believe in the players i have instead of always looking at who might be coming in
8178888 we lost only three games last year and why should we not be capable of repeating that
8178889 he is one of the best strikers in the world and in the summer he was sensational
8178890 with robbie keane we are even more dangerous many european clubs would be happy with a strikeforce of torres kuyt and keane
8178891 it is a luxury and we are guaranteed many goals in the competitions
8178892 clearly i want to win all the time but ive learned that sometimes its more advantageous to score as many points as possible and live to fight another day
8178893 my aim is still to win the world championship and you dont do that by ending up in the barriers after making an opportunistic move
8178894 in valencia we scored a very useful haul of points and ive actually come away from the weekend having extended my lead in the championship despite losing two points to felipe

8178899 they used to be teased every time they used the boys toilets so they started using the girls toilets instead but that made the girls feel uncomfortable it made these boys unhappy and started to affect their work
8178900 they girls dont have problems with transvestites but going to the same private area like a toilet makes them uneasy
8178901 the transvestite kids may behave even more effeminately than the girls do but their anatomy is still like that of a boy
8178902 it was inconvenient when we didnt have our own toilet
8178903 then we had to use both male and female toilets when there were no people in them it was a bit uncomfortable
8178904 a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
8178905 when working on our new game we decided to mix three popular casual game genres and give a classic game play a new look with innovative twists explosive bonuses spectacular visual effects and fascinating storyline we believe all that made 4 elements very attractive
8178906 based on the initial reviews we received from our partners and customers we expect the game to show outstanding results both online and in physical retail where by the way we are still looking to explore new markets in europe and asia

8178948 following so closely on their righteous pride and that of the country it is truly heartbreaking that they must now contemplate the loss of a beloved son and brother
8178949 i was able to help marco i found him at 8 000m he was sitting in the snow unconscious he was completely flat lying down i had taken one small bottle of oxygen for emergencies and i was able to use that after about 10 or 15 minutes he started to move and became conscious
8178950 tonight will surely be yet another test of their courage as their limbs are thawed and the extent of their injuries is revealed

8178998 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor

8179034 sie begibt sich in die h nde einer partei die einfluss ohne verantwortung ohne jede verpflichtung h tte die w chentlich daf r sorgen kann dass regierungsf higkeit wieder verloren geht
8179035 es st rt mich dass die linke nicht in eine politische haftung genommen werden w rde
8179036 it was when hillary and bill came and it was like 90 to 100 degrees i just handed people water and stuff i was wearing a gore t shirt
8179037 is just helping people get set up in the morning
8179038 it was pretty cool seeing ted kennedy and michelle obama i just liked how many people had their signs up
8179039 he was put to work hed go to events and hand out literature bumper stickers a lot of publicity stuff
8179040 american people had their first date with michelle obama and it was matched in another way by another generation by ted kennedy
8179041 spanned the generations to the way people were inspired and motivated by john kennedy those of us who were their age at one time had a similar opportunity to be motivated by change
8179042 ted kennedy inspired us one more time and michelle obama is modeling that change it was an unusual historic event and ive never been prouder to be a democrat in my life
8179043 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8179044 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8179045 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8179046 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8179047 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8179048 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8179049 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8179050 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8179051 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8179052 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8179053 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8179054 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8179055 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8179056 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004
8179057 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8179058 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
8179059 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
8179060 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
8179061 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
8179062 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
8179063 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
8179064 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
8179065 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
8179066 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
8179067 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
8179068 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
8179069 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
8179070 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
8179071 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
8179072 we know there are people out there with vital information that can assist us in identifying the six youths who came to the tower block that day
8179073 it may be that they havent contacted us because they dont want to get involved or think other people are bound to come forward
8179074 i urge these people to contact us in the strictest confidence and talk over what you may have seen know or have heard no matter how insignificant you feel the information may be
8179075 from cctv evidence we have recovered it is apparent minutes after ahmed fell to his death five of the six youths left the area
8179076 they were seen riding on pedal cycles leaving the trelawney estate along paragon road away from mare street one of the male youths left the area on foot running away towards tesco did you see this person
8179077 he was a nice kid a friendly guy he didnt get in trouble
8179078 he was at home most of the time he always helped people out if he could
8179079 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8179080 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8179081 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8179082 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8179083 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8179084 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8179085 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8179086 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8179087 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8179088 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8179089 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8179090 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8179091 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8179092 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8179093 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8179094 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8179095 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8179096 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8179097 if george w bush was seeking re election wed be 20 points ahead
8179098 in arizona the only way to get around is by small private plane
8179099 we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
8179100 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8179101 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8179102 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8179103 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8179104 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8179105 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8179106 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8179107 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8179108 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8179109 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8179110 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8179111 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8179112 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8179113 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
8179114 seems everyone that believes in gravity also hate ice cream
8179115 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8179116 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8179117 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8179118 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8179119 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8179120 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8179121 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8179122 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8179123 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8179124 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8179125 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
8179126 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8179127 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8179128 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8179129 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8179130 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8179131 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8179132 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8179133 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8179134 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8179135 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8179136 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
8179137 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8179138 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8179139 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8179140 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8179141 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8179142 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8179143 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8179144 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8179145 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8179146 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8179147 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8179148 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8179149 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8179150 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8179151 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8179152 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8179153 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8179154 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8179155 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8179156 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8179157 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8179158 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8179159 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8179160 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8179161 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8179162 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8179163 the same speech hes been giving for months why didnt he give the germans something more
8179164 it was a tent in the desert 100 degree heat off and on for what seemed like forever
8179165 why was i held by the united states like that when i was their ally
8179166 if theyre exaggerating and distorting this much in august what will october be like
8179167 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8179168 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8179169 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8179170 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8179171 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8179172 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8179173 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8179174 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8179175 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
8179176 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
8179177 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
8179178 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
8179179 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
8179180 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
8179181 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
8179182 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
8179183 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
8179184 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
8179185 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
8179186 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
8179187 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
8179188 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
8179189 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
8179190 the first half of 2008 has been characterised by the very challenging trading conditions in the uk us and spain
8179191 the board remains convinced of the fundamental value of the business over the medium and long term and our primary focus is to amend certain of the existing borrowing agreements
8179192 to this end the group is engaged in constructive dialogue and is not aware of any issues which would prevent these amendments being finalised by the end of this year
8179193 constructive discussions with the relevant lenders are ongoing and the board is of the view that a satisfactory conclusion will be reached
8179194 tell people that biology and the environment causes obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8179195 as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves
8179196 girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses
8179197 our need and not just in relation to public health issues is to act on the environment while fostering positive peer pressure and social norms we have to take away the excuses
8179198 leadership information and incentives and empowerment will be characteristic of our approach no nannying
8179199 lots of warm words but with very little policy substance
8179200 everyone believes that individual responsibility matters but the tories are using individual responsibility as an excuse for their lack of effective policies in this area
8179201 by contrast we are committed to the 75 million healthy weights healthy lives campaign which encourages the public supermarkets retailers and local sports clubs to help people lead healthier lives
8179202 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8179203 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8179204 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8179205 children and families living in areas already experiencing relative deprivation therefore face further inequity because they have less access to high quality childcare provision
8179206 local authorities should strive to support improvement in settings in these areas
8179207 its particularly encouraging to note that where we found inadequate provision in previous inspections these settings have improved significantly
8179208 however there is still more to do to ensure that outcomes for all children are of a consistently high standard and that every child has access to the same quality care particularly in areas where provision is generally poorer
8179209 too often staff ratios are low and numbers of qualified leaders and staff do not meet requirements putting at risk the quality of childcare in these settings
8179210 key issues include being unable to identify or respond to child protection concerns and lack of training and understanding in first aid
8179211 providers judged to be inadequate have significant improvements to make if they are to meet the demands of the early years foundation stage and provide the high quality education and care children deserve
8179212 its heartening that childcare in this country is improving but we want to drive up standards even further
8179213 that is why we are introducing the early years foundation stage in september which will give every child equal right to the best quality care and learning
8179214 we have also allocated 305m for early years graduate leader training as we know that this is the best way to improve standards
8179215 sure start has an important role in driving up the quality of all forms of childcare in the most deprived areas these figures show sure start is falling well short of the mark
8179216 despite spending 3 billion a year on early years the government has failed to ensure that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds consistently have access to a choice of high quality childcare
8179217 it is unacceptable that childcare does not reach the standard needed to give children the best start in life in areas with the highest deprivation
8179218 we are really keen to hear from amateur radio clubs and individuals interested in taking part in the event
8179219 this year were launching a new category a young persons prize for special achievement aimed at the under 18s
8179220 the award will go to the young person who has made an outstanding contribution to the transmission event for example in fundraising helping others or making a high number of contacts
8179221 the specially adapted sets are a blessing for people who are unable to see
8179222 they are designed to be easy to use and to help give blind people greater independence
8179223 both the uk and scottish governments should ensure that changes to legislation that has an impact on the administration of elections are not applied to any election or electoral registration event held within six months of the new provision coming into force
8179224 the uk government should take the opportunity of any future legislation to introduce individual electoral registration in great britain to produce a clear legal framework for the registration of electors aiming for rationalisation as a minimum and simplification wherever possible
8179225 the uk government should also undertake to rationalise and consolidate existing legislation relating to election management ensuring that the legal framework focuses on clearly articulating electoral policy rather than micro managing the delivery of elections
8179226 when we make decisions about how elections are run we all need to think about the voters interests above all else
8179227 elections are the opportunity for citizens to take part in the democratic process and have their say about how we are governed and the services we receive
8179228 the planning and running of elections need to be more robust and co ordinated we are still trying to run 21st century elections with 19th century structures and the system is under severe strain
8179229 ensuring that returning officers remain independent and are reinforced with the leadership support and direction of the chair of an election management board would build on the strengths of the current system
8179230 our proposal is designed to allow local returning officers to continue to respond to local circumstances while ensuring that there is a consistently high standard of service for all electors across the uk
8179231 as usual labour ministers are just burying their heads in the sand
8179232 they must not ignore the calls from across the political spectrum for urgent action to tackle electoral fraud
8179233 we have been calling for individual electoral registration for years but the government will only talk about it what we need is action
8179234 individual electoral registration and accurate electoral registers are essential for a free and fair democratic process gimmicks like weekend voting are pointless if the very foundations of our democracy are being called into question
8179235 this new protocol is implemented through a windows application that uses a computer sound card for all the analog to digital conversion it provides error free arq transfers within 200 500 or 2000 hz bandwidths
8179236 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8179237 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8179238 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8179239 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
8179240 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8179241 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
8179242 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
8179243 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
8179244 four years ago if you said wed be at a hillary happy hour at the dnc i would have called you crazy but today is a great opportunity for people who agree that sen barack obama doesnt have the experience to be president of the united states
8179245 im a registered republican for the first time in my voting life
8179246 he reminds me of what the jimmy carter era was like if they think jimmy carter had it bad just wait if obama gets into the white house that will be bad news in so many ways
8179247 the simple fact remains change will occur anyway no matter who the president is for every man woman and child change will happen question is who is best able to handle that change
8179248 four years ago if you said wed be at a hillary happy hour at the dnc i would have called you crazy but today is a great opportunity for people who agree that sen barack obama doesnt have the experience to be president of the united states
8179249 im a registered republican for the first time in my voting life
8179250 he reminds me of what the jimmy carter era was like if they think jimmy carter had it bad just wait if obama gets into the white house that will be bad news in so many ways

8179256 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
8179257 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
8179258 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
8179259 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
8179260 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
8179261 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
8179262 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
8179263 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
8179264 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
8179265 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
8179266 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
8179267 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
8179268 mae bt yn araf iawn i ymateb yn y byr dymor mae angen trwsior offer ond yn yr hir dymor mae angen uwchraddior gyfnewidfa i ddatrys y broblem

8179272 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8179273 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8179274 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8179275 its vital that older people claim money thats rightfully theirs to help with their day to day needs
8179276 rising living costs are leaving many pensioners struggling to make ends meet yet millions are missing out on their share of up to 5 billion in pension credit and other benefits unclaimed each year which could make a huge difference to their quality of life
8179277 with the rules on backdating of benefits changing in october we would urge any older person struggling to make ends meet to make a claim now to ensure they dont lose out on cash thats rightfully theirs
8179278 pensioner poverty is a real issue which must be tackled urgently and claiming benefits which belong in older peoples pockets is crucial to that
8179279 the operation has now entered its fifth week and initial results are very encouraging
8179280 feedback from the community has been extremely positive and it would appear that there has been a reduction in anti social behaviour and juvenile victims of crime
8179281 we have seen an increase in parental supervision over the past few weeks which has been welcomed by the community
8179282 only a small number of young people have been out unsupervised beyond the times of the voluntary curfew with a number of these not living in the close hill area
8179283 it is the view of west sussex county council that this approach makes no sense and will leave gatwick unfit for purpose for the olympic period and beyond
8179284 gatwick is going to be a major gateway into this country for the olympics second only to heathrow and we need a fast efficient and effective rail network to move people around
8179285 it would be a major disappointment if we only get the concourse improvements before 2012
8179286 we need the track signalling and platform improvements for the long term future of gatwick as part of ensuring that its growth from 35 5 million passengers a year to a predicted 40 million by 2015 is as sustainable as possible
8179287 that means we need to encourage more people across the south east and beyond to leave their cars at home and use public transport for journeys to the airport
8179288 it surely also makes much more sense to complete all the work needed at gatwick as a single package instead of adopting a piecemeal approach completing the full scheme at the same time is also going to minimise disruption
8179289 at this stage were looking at 13 victims and were following up those lines of inquiry at the moment
8179290 they got a group between eight and 12 of us together and theyd just start chanting and i would wake up during these sessions and see what was going on
8179291 we have an enormous opportunity to create real energy independence for the uk freeing ourselves from the shackles of foreign oil coal and gas this will require the kind of ambition and political will that succeeded in putting man on the moon
8179292 i am delighted that nick clegg is calling for a green revolution in the way we produce power i would add that we need to support into emerging carbon capture technologies hydrogen fuel cells technology and environmentally friendly methane hydrate mining and use
8179293 the recent russian invasion of georgia and the ongoing troubles in iraq and iran show just how dangerously reliant britain is on energy from unstable parts of the world
8179294 we have to build up our own energy supplies and as an island nation we have an abundance of natural and clean energy sources that both labour and conservative governments have failed to develop
8179295 whilst labour and the conservatives joined together earlier this year to agree britain should have a new generation of nuclear power stations liberal democrats believe this will leave a legacy of radioactive waste for future generations
8179296 so my teachers always said i better go to medical school
8179297 coming to unmc feels like coming home to me since im originally from the midwest
8179298 howard fox is a highly respected scientific leader in the field of neurodegenerative medicine recruiting someone of his stature is immeasurable
8179299 most people look at neuroaids from a viral aspect how the virus affects the body but i began looking at it from a brain and immune cell response to infection
8179300 we were one of the first to do immune studies on how certain t cells work to control or not control the virus in the brain
8179301 howard fox is a highly respected scientific leader in the field of neurodegenerative medicine
8179302 recruiting someone of his stature is immeasurable he is extraordinarily intelligent has the highest moral integrity for his work and complements the work our scientists are currently doing in this department
8179303 the environment that has been developed at unmc to study neurodegenerative disorders is among the best
8179304 it was not only the new facilities and state of the art equipment which of course are key components but the people at unmc the scientists their work and the leadership are outstanding in this department and at this university
8179305 in the academic medical environment of unmc i can do more translational work
8179306 i hope to develop a connection with the clinical side and work with the neurologists and psychiatrists who treat disorders of the brain
8179307 gustav is headed right toward the centre of the gulf of mexico hurricanes taking this route are usually threatening

8179311 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
8179312 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
8179313 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
8179314 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
8179315 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
8179316 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
8179317 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
8179318 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
8179319 heres yer bologna sandwich with a turkey feather on it

8179341 i am worried about my father and mother they are coming from nyala on this flight no one has any information about the situation they are in
8179342 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala
8179343 im not sure if its connected to kalma but its related to that the government kills and the international community does not intervene what can the darfurian people do

8179371 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
8179372 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
8179373 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
8179374 we zijn tevreden dat we kunnen rapporteren dat ons herstructureringsplan wat bestond uit kostenbesparende maatregelen en een sterke focus op marketing en sales zijn vruchten afwerpt
8179375 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8179376 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8179377 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8179378 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8179379 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems

8179384 advertising trends have continued to deteriorate over the course of the year and future performance will inevitably be linked to the economies of the uk and to a lesser extent that of the republic of ireland
8179385 in response to the current challenging circumstances we continue to actively manage our cost base to achieve productivity gains and in a manner which will protect the long term prospects of the group
8179386 to minimise the impact on profitability cost management programmes have been implemented which have benefited the first half of 2008
8179387 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8179388 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates

8179393 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8179394 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8179395 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8179396 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8179397 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8179398 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8179399 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8179400 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8179401 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8179402 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8179403 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8179404 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8179405 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8179406 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8179407 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8179408 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list

8179423 el nacionalismo est agotado y el pa s vasco vive una situaci n insostenible

8179429 es la nica manera que tienen de mantenerse en el poder arzalluz siempre nos ha transmitido ideas y declaraciones bastante estramb ticas y su salida de la vida pol tica no le ha cambiado
8179430 todo lo relacionado con la crisis lo hemos conocido a trav s de los medios de comunicaci n pero a nivel interno nadie ha mostrado su disconformidad
8179431 quienes trabajan con antonio basagoiti le han dado una oportunidad
8179432 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8179433 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8179434 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8179435 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8179436 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
8179437 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
8179438 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8179439 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8179440 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8179441 richard has made a significant contribution to the strategic development of our veterinary services in particular he has led the introduction of preventive services in our petaid hospitals including microchipping vaccinations and neutering his enthusiasm credibility and knowledge is invaluable
8179442 i am delighted to have the opportunity to take on this important role responsible for maintaining and developing the delivery of pdsas veterinary services i shall be building upon the great work already in place and look forward to working closely with all teams across pdsa as we continue to treat many thousands of sick and injured pets every day
8179443 over the last five years as chief veterinary surgeon ive had the opportunity to expand pdsas scope of activity including the launch of our biggest ever pet health campaign long live pets earlier this year in addition i have enjoyed establishing strong links between pdsa and a number of veterinary schools professional bodies and the royal college of veterinary surgeons relationships that i look forward to developing further
8179444 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8179445 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8179446 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8179447 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8179448 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8179449 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8179450 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8179451 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8179452 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8179453 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8179454 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8179455 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8179456 zuid osseti en abchazi zijn en blijven een deel van georgi
8179457 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8179458 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
8179459 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
8179460 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
8179461 given the rapid weakening of the peso at a time when inflation is soaring suggests there are substantial rate hike risks yes this is despite slowing gdp gross domestic product growth
8179462 we expect two and 10 year government bond yields to rise by 200 300 basis points before the yearend

8179478 thanks to the national curriculum and holocaust memorial day the demand for knowledge and interpretation has never been so high
8179479 the fascinating input of norbert herz as well as the other contributors will give teachers the materials to effectively bring this information to their pupils
8179480 this event will provide accurate tools to educators to deal with teaching the holocaust in the classroom and to the local government authorities who organise annual holocaust memorial day events
8179481 it will also acquaint these 80 teachers and educators with some of the newest research on the holocaust
8179482 we need to understand how such a thing could happen to prevent it from happening again
8179483 relying on subjective memory has its place but that is not enough we need to make strong and continuing efforts to understand the facts
8179484 but listening to witnesses is crucial and norbert herz will be the first to talk in our program

8179501 pendirian kami jelas dan kami tidak akan berganjak dengan pendirian untuk menyuarakan rasa tidak puas hati kami kepada menteri atau timbalan menteri walaupun dalam keadaan hujan
8179502 kami berharap supaya ahli parlimen sama ada dalam barisan nasional bn atau pakatan rakyat supaya membahaskan perkara ini dengan serius untuk kepentingan generasi masa depan serta menggantikan dengan akta yang lebih relevan
8179503 selain itu biarlah dengan perbahasan tersebut mampu menghasilkan kesimpulan yang lebih positif kepada semua mahasiswa
8179504 is something our staff our students and our community can be proud of i think it shows our schools are headed in the right direction
8179505 we have a significant number of special needs students in this district
8179506 they make up a significant proportion of our student population and we must provide the same level of growth for them as we do regular students
8179507 are a byproduct of quality instruction im pleased with the hard work and effort of both our educators and our students
8179508 they have generated a lot more thought among teachers the teachers have become more engaged in interpreting the data and talk about it more with one another thats a good thing
8179509 i told them look guys practice is going to be bad tomorrow if we dont step it up
8179510 i dont know what it was but i put it to them and told them that they are the difference and they have to step up and play
8179511 a call doesnt go our way and we got frazzled
8179512 through 60 minutes we had the game controlled play and did what we wanted to
8179513 it all doesnt mean a thing if you cant put the ball in the net
8179514 it was nice to finally have some guys put the ball in the back of the net
8179515 the first goal was a great assist by denardo and i ran as fast as i could and played it softly
8179516 the other i just flicked it over his head and finished it
8179517 i made it so slow and i didnt mean to do it i guess it was for the audience
8179518 we outplayed them and this was a spark for us to show us that we can do this again
8179519 to say are we surprised that she surpassed that record absolutely not shes a fantastic young lady
8179520 we have 20 more games left in the season and then we have postseason
8179521 we just needed to get the nerves out the first game of theseason theres a target on our backs we got through it
8179522 dalton was just really scrappy they went after everything and they just played really good
8179523 we were a little lackluster to say the least dalton was serving very aggressive and we did not serve so aggressive which is usually one of our fortes
8179524 dalton was scrappy as all get out it was a very very good game
8179525 we knew that it was going to be a tough game coming in we knew that northwestern was probably ahead for the league
8179526 kara is such a smart hitter as far as knowing what to do with the ball so that challenge is always there
8179527 it will be a 10 000 pound weight off my shoulder once that facility is built and operational
8179528 in essence right now we are guaranteed 1 175 million in grants which is super absolutely super
8179529 we got exactly what we expected to get from the usda which is good because a lot of times things come through less than what youd expect
8179530 if we get another 500 000 that would basically cover our plant
8179531 regardless of whether we get this grant were under the gun to get this thing built
8179532 hopefully well put this thing out to bid next spring and start construction late next summer
8179533 how do you completely control two games and lose in five i cant answer that
8179534 we just didnt play big tonight there are really no words to be said we just didnt do our job
8179535 were inconsistent tonight was like a rollercoaster but we werent nervous in game 5
8179536 they have shown great leadership and without that we go nowhere
8179537 schwamberger is a four year letterwinner but holly was a jv player last year orrville went after her tonight but she stood in there she was solid all the way through
8179538 she was hitting shots getting her serves in she was really focused
8179539 we let a couple of balls drop and we cant do that
8179540 i just think we were worried about the outcome rather than the performance we were worrying about losing instead of winning
8179541 yes were disappointed but well practice and well play a lot harder well fix it and be ready to go
8179542 it would make life a lot easier if the whole state was quarantined
8179543 eventually its just going to devastate ash trees in ohio
8179544 if i lived on the north end of wooster and i was concerned i would go ahead and start
8179545 its going to affect the ecosystem in ways that are hard to predict
8179546 it would be good for us not so good for the ash trees
8179547 fromthe management and financial point of view there is no optioneven to think about it

8179622 four million people have been pushed back into poverty this year because of rising food prices

8179626 this government is trying to evangelise the whole country and turn it into a protestant state
8179627 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8179628 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8179629 to see how things play out in the coming weeks
8179630 i can confirm that us personnel remain on the ground at the yongbyon facility monitoring the sites
8179631 at this stage if the north koreans are not prepared to make specific commitments on verification i think the process will bog down probably for the remainder of the

8179636 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8179637 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state

8179642 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses

8179648 its a war for identity i am a kashmiri muslim and my dress and look have got nothing to do with what i am shouting for
8179649 this is the generation that was born in the bloody 1990s and grew up in the machiavellian 2000s they have lived and outsmarted violence they enjoy the consumerist goodies but have an anger latent in their hearts and minds
8179650 this generation symbolises the future of kashmir and is politically more aware than their previous generations
8179651 we no longer trust any leaders not even the mirwaizs and the geelanis chairmen of their respective factions of the separatist hurriyat conference not to talk of the abdullahs and the muftis mainstream politicians of the world
8179652 i wish someone was in the driving seat to channel and steer our energy and enthusiasm but all politicians are busy in petty politics
8179653 the uprising we see now is the hidden anger it typifies the failure of efforts by india to win the hearts and minds of muslim kashmiris
8179654 kashmiri public opinion is hardly largely pro pakistan or anti india its distrust that runs deep todays youths have seen it all they are not radicalised islamists as india or its rightwing parties would like to believe
8179655 they are not indifferent to realities they know the failures and successes of both countries but the current conundrum in kashmir is a result of the mistakes of previous generations they have left the dispute unsettled

8179687 idealiter zetten we multi talenten in aan zowel de business als ict zijde zodat men beter op de hoogte is van de mogelijkheden van ict en de bedrijfsdoelstellingen het probleem ligt echter in de nu nog te beperkte inzet van businessconsultants met ict kennis
8179688 de technologie kan echter een grote bijdrage leveren aan de bedrijfsdoelstellingen
8179689 dit gaat veel verder dan alleen procesmatige ondersteuning 53 procent van de ondervraagde managers onderzoekt niet eens de return on investment na een ict project en in 39 procent van de gevallen vindt geen evaluatie plaats aan de hand van de vooraf bepaalde doelstellingen ict is voor veel businessmanagers een onbekende wereld waardoor ze hier zelf niet kritisch naar denken te kunnen kijken
8179690 dit roept om meer tastbare resultaten hoeveel komt er binnen en hoeveel gaat er uit
8179691 door het gebrek aan kennis heeft het bedrijfsleven vanaf het begin van het ontstaan van ict de touwtjes uit handen gegeven waardoor twee aparte werelden zijn ontstaan deze werelden moeten weer samen komen en daarvoor moet het bedrijfsleven de regie weer in handen nemen
8179692 desalniettemin wordt het nog te zelden ingezet om echt vooruit te komen als organisatie of om het verschil te maken met de concurrentie
8179693 het beperkte besef van de potentie blijkt eens te meer uit het feit dat slechts tien procent van de ondervraagde managers als reden noemt dat hij van tevoren weet hoeveel dit hem uiteindelijk weer oplevert in euros daarom zijn wij een groot voorstander van het werken met business cases dan krijgen opdrachtgevers een idee van het mogelijke rendement van investeringen die ze doen dat is bij bijvoorbeeld marketing niet anders denkbaar
8179694 het start saving programma is onderdeel van ons green it provider programma het nieuwe programma is gebaseerd op de green scan van green data systems
8179695 she started yelling her name and i said that i will go inside to get her and she said i couldnt do that i didnt say anything when i went inside
8179696 i lay my life down for somebody and now i know my son will do the same thing makes you feel good makes you feel real good real proud
8179697 we believe in the value of community outreach and taking an active interest in the communities we serve said mike mckinney field vice president for allstates west central region
8179698 allstate is proud to support the kansas school for the deaf through the allstate foundation
8179699 i would like to advocate for more access for the deaf
8179700 ive had people say they talked to a deaf person about something but when i communicated in sign language the deaf person hadnt understood what the person was trying to say
8179701 i was born hearing but i should have been born deaf
8179702 i love the deaf culture i love everything about it
8179703 the treatments that she billed for were not done and even if they had been done they would have served no purpose other than to defraud the insurers
8179704 they can jerk us around downtown but were not going to let them steal our hope
8179705 my directive is youre going to take one at a time
8179706 lets get this done right before we start to worry about another community id like to claim this success before we move on to the next one
8179707 whats hard to communicate is the hope we got after doing this plan for a year it drives your spirit
8179708 every year that they come in and say were doing this redevelopment plan and then they disappear and never come back again that harms the trust in the neighborhood
8179709 and the problems of bergen square the crime rate and the poverty index will continue to rise
8179710 its a direct result of the judge not understanding how redevelopment works
8179711 i hope that john morganelli understands what he did is wrong and immediately sends the city of harrisburg the 6 that he stiffed the city
8179712 there are aspects of his work that have been fine there are aspects that are not acceptable
8179713 i feel really good im really grateful for the votes
8179714 we have a budget workshop on thursday and i need to be fully prepared for that
8179715 we have some important issues that have yet to be resolved
8179716 like some elderly people older animals are often able to compensate for chronic health problems up to a point but when something goes wrong you can have a sudden dramatic worsening of their condition
8179717 she was fairly weak breathing more heavily than elephants would without changes in the heart and lungs
8179718 in a zoo situation were typically not looking at healthy animals for heart disease
8179719 until we get a full medical history we dont know what caused her death
8179720 signs of noncompliance or any issues with the welfare of the animal
8179721 i dont think the total decision should revolve around whether theres a sign on a building
8179722 the system is functioning the way it is supposed to and we are restoring integrity to the zoning process
8179723 the bulk of our conversations had not been about signs
8179724 i think its a bad decision for the city and it will reflect poorly when businesses look at working deals out with the city
8179725 if you cant even make a deal business dont want to fluff around with that nobody wants to sit around and negotiate with someone who cant make a deal
8179726 it will potentially weaken the mayors ability and commerce directors ability to attract business although its not the end of the western world
8179727 i was told at the time they were investigating alleged threats against foreigners by other foreigners and by chinese people
8179728 why are you in beijing what are you doing here who sent you here
8179729 my experience in china prior to that was great everyone was being friendly
8179730 further indication of why i need to do this work
8179731 i dont think the total decision should revolve around whether theres a sign on a building
8179732 the system is functioning the way it is supposed to and we are restoring integrity to the zoning process
8179733 the bulk of our conversations had not been about signs
8179734 i think its a bad decision for the city and it will reflect poorly when businesses look at working deals out with the city
8179735 if you cant even make a deal business dont want to fluff around with that nobody wants to sit around and negotiate with someone who cant make a deal
8179736 it will potentially weaken the mayors ability and commerce directors ability to attract business although its not the end of the western world
8179737 what is more unique about this is that they are actually building it into the curriculum
8179738 were trying to use the city and the metropolitan region as a way of developing real life encounters that will enhance whatever is being taught in class people learn best when they are experiencing something
8179739 its a step in the right direction it just needs more clarification
8179740 if being in philadelphia is part of the appeal of a temple education then rounding out the core curriculum in the opportunities and challenges in philadelphia is a superb learning context
8179741 that only helps us in terms of revitalizing and bringing fresh blood in
8179742 the course is structured so that we lecture on underlying principles related to matter and energy and we try to make it more comprehensible through field trips
8179743 its really great to see local examples of these concepts
8179744 for the most part faculty have made their peace with that and are supportive of the program
8179745 if it hadnt that would have meant people didnt care
8179746 i went back to see if they had reasonable objections
8179747 in light of st bartholomews historic importance to the african american people of camden
8179748 i think its a terrible shame about the pastor hes a great pastor
8179749 where else are you going to find a priest who truly understands what its like to be disabled
8179750 were a larger church and we have a more vibrant worship site than st aloysius we have people coming from 40 different zip codes from three counties due to our youth ministry music ministry and handicapped accessibility
8179751 once the parishes are merged most of the remedies under canon law are gone
8179752 the subpoenas issued by fumo are highly improper and seek the production of personal and confidential educational records specially protected by federal law that he is not entitled to receive
8179753 any and all records related to application to the university including but not limited to letters of recommendation essays and any accompanying documentation
8179754 we have to leave them enough money so they can go out and buy things
8179755 they all want to put west nile virus to rest which makes complete sense
8179756 but this process of informing people does not i cant believe it was done so suddenly
8179757 were talking people walking their dogs eating dinner outside this is perfect weather to leave your windows open
8179758 whats going to happen to the elderly couple out for their evening walk and all of a sudden this low flying plane is dropping a mist on them
8179759 days at least before action is taken its not like theyre tipping off the mosquitoes
8179760 our fear is that right now we run a high risk of this jumping into the human population
8179761 is just that a good precaution does it mean that if you stay outdoors youll have an adverse reaction no but to be absolutely certain and put everybody at ease you can simply go indoors
8179762 is meant to stay in the air where the mosquitoes fly
8179763 reduce the risk of any complications to a very small number
8179764 but we havent asked residents to flip their trash cans over
8179765 is being treated as a criminal investigation avalon is aggressively and immediately pursuing answers
8179766 we want to find out whos responsible for this act
8179767 authorities were fortunate to get some clues early in the investigation
8179768 but this wont take them to a specific office or individual like dr jones office in atlantic city
8179769 we cant comment on the source right now thats what were investigating
8179770 i think mayor pagliughi is probably right somebody came by and wanted to get rid of it medical waste
8179771 they knew it was illegal i cant imagine it was a mistake
8179772 i think it was done intentionally and when they find them i hope they stick it to them with a couple of their own needles throw the book at them
8179773 every shore community feels for avalon because someone might want to do it along their shore avalon is a great place with clean beaches
8179774 it could have fallen off a barge but it wouldve had to be really close to the shoreline barges are usually five to seven miles out
8179775 it would have to remain in a container or bag until broken apart by the wave action on the beach
8179776 someone could have taken a hike along the beach and gotten rid of the stuff in the middle of the night
8179777 we are carefully and continually monitoring the avalon beaches during this unfortunate event and will do everything we can to keep the beaches safe and open
8179778 we have heard from some community residents and some elected officials that they question whether the site they selected is a sound choice
8179779 were partners with the school district and obviously they have concerns as do camelot and the residents and political leaders of rhawnhurst we are in a holding pattern as is everyone else until we can come to some kind of decision
8179780 all sides have valid points i understand the communitys concerns they live there that is their community but 500 kids deserve a right to go to a decent well run school no matter what happened to them before we want to see that happen
8179781 do we treat teenagers like animals in heat or like people with a brain that have the ability to control themselves
8179782 we believe human beings can control their sexual desires and should be encouraged to
8179783 there has been a groundswell of opposition to these programs from states across the country and we thought we had put the issue to rest here in pennsylvania too
8179784 we are just trying to be fair across the board and make sure everyone has access to the funding they need
8179785 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8179786 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8179787 were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8179788 i know now that she is truly into party unity
8179789 at the end that was a truly unified moment i think a lot of people wanted to hear her say it and now we have we can move forward
8179790 there is only one candidate from the middle class that understands the middle class
8179791 george bush has put the middle class in a hole and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8179792 if you drilled everywhere if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards even the ones he doesnt know he has
8179793 if you think the last eight years have been good
8179794 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8179795 and a lot of people that like hillary may say well if it cant be hillary lets have mccain
8179796 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8179797 and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8179798 the timing would never really be good if you live in that park
8179799 i dont know how a person can live with themselves doing this to people
8179800 sollen wir nun auch kommentare auf unserer website erm glichen oder votings oder ein forum
8179801 viele marketingleiter und online verantwortliche grosser unternehmen stellen sich berechtigterweise diese frage
8179802 die digitale marketing spirale der weg vom besucher zum brand evangelisten
8179803 het is allemaal zo snel gegaan ik heb niet eens afscheid van mijn teamgenoten kunnen nemen
8179804 ik was verbijsterd toen ik het weer in de winkel zag liggen
8179805 van gaal had het contract van de columnisten opgezegd dus ik wist niet beter dan dat het zou stoppen later had ze het nog wel over een andere naam voor het blad maar ik heb niets meer gehoord ok dan kappen we er mee dacht ik totdat ik het blad weer zag liggen
8179806 ik heb vijftig procent van catherine media bv maar ik weet niet wat ik kan doen
8179807 alles wat ik doe kost geld en van gaal heeft meer geld ik vind dit z erg het sloopt me
8179808 tja waarom vallen mensen flauw geen idee er was geen gedrang en iedereen was eigenlijk heel rustig
8179809 vooral vooraan zijn er altijd een paar die te lang zonder drinken in de hitte van tegen elkaar drukkende mensen staan het is dat heel gebruikelijk dat mensen dan flauwvallen
8179810 als er al een functionerend systeem zou komen dit veel te complex en te duur zou zijn

8179814 wir hoffen dass die verleger die letzten wochen dazu genutzt haben sich konstruktiv mit unseren berechtigten forderungen auseinanderzusetzen
8179815 wir fordern f r die zweite verhandlungsrunde ein tarifangebot der zeitschriftenverleger die kolleginnen und kollegen in den redaktionen haben ein anrecht auf einen raschen tarifabschluss

8179820 russland ver ndert eigenm chtig und mit gewalt die grenzen europas wenn europa sich das einmal gefallen l sst wird russland es in zukunft wieder versuchen
8179821 sie versteht wie die russen sind sie hat schlie lich unter ihnen gelebt sie wei dass l gen f r sie ein normales mittel der kommunikation ist und dass sie sehr brutal sein k nnen
8179822 wir haben stets darauf hingewiesen dass es danach unm glich sein w rde den abchasen und osseten und dutzenden anderen gruppen in der welt zu sagen dass das was f r die kosovo albaner gut war f r sie nicht gut genug sein soll
8179823 wenn ich georgien verlasse werden die russen unseren luftraum schlie en und verhindern dass ich zur ck ins land komme
8179824 die spirale der provokationen muss aufh ren und zwar sofort sonst kann die lage schneller au er kontrolle geraten als wir glauben
8179825 wenn wir nicht aufpassen ger t die gesamte sicherheitsarchitektur in europa ins wanken mit unabsehbaren folgen f r uns alle
8179826 ganz normal dass am anfang und am ende einer sendung ein kurzer hinweis auf einen sponsor zu sehen ist
8179827 in ordnung wenn sich dadurch ein anstieg der geb hren verhindern l sst
8179828 bei ard und zdf auch nach 20 uhr werbung gezeigt
8179829 sponsorhinweise vor oder nach sendungen bei ard und zdf h ufiger
8179830 wenn sich dadurch ein anstieg der rundfunkgeb hr verhindern l sst
8179831 wer die wogen der ver ffentlichten diskussion um das thema verfolgt hat ist m glicherweise berrascht von der gro en akzeptanz die sendungssponsoring de facto bei den fernsehzuschauern hat aber das publikum wurde hierzu bisher auch noch nicht geh rt
8179832 die berschaubar wenigen und kurzen sponsorhinweise im abendprogramm von ard und zdf und die allgegenw rtigkeit von werbung und sponsoring im t glichen leben lassen bei den zuschauern kein st rgef hl aufkommen
8179833 wir finden eindeutige belege dass sponsoring von den fernsehzuschauern als integraler und normaler bestandteil des programms wahrgenommen wird und das gilt auch f r zuschauer die bevorzugt ard und zdf sehen
8179834 letztlich sind es die fernsehzuschauer die derartige sponsorhinweise anschauen und die wir befragen m ssen
8179835 jetzt haben wir auch nachvollziehbares und umfangreiches zahlenmaterial dass sich unsere zuschauer nicht von sponsoringhinweisen gest rt f hlen
8179836 this is not a case of a hospital going out of business kind of thing
8179837 there are opportunities for consolidating numerous clinical programs to save money and offer patrons better care over time
8179838 i dont believe a merger would result in any significant job losses
8179839 we remain optimistic that we will find a corporate and organizational design that can best bring these venerable institutions together in a way that protects and builds upon their individual unique legacies and yet realizes were going to create a whole new unique health delivery system

8179844 if it goes in the direction of aggravating relations its not going to be our choice i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
8179845 if you give a gorilla a choice of eating fruit or a leaf it will take the fruit every time
8179846 but if you look at a gorillas skull its sharp teeth are adapted to consuming tough leaves they dont eat the leaves unless they have to
8179847 damit positioniert sich e on f r den sicherlich h rter werdenden wettbewerb in den n chsten jahren
8179848 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8179849 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8179850 to see how things play out in the coming weeks
8179851 i can confirm that us personnel remain on the ground at the yongbyon facility monitoring the sites
8179852 at this stage if the north koreans are not prepared to make specific commitments on verification i think the process will bog down probably for the remainder of the
8179853 i dont think the bush administration will cave in on this
8179854 the law recognizes a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8179855 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8179856 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state
8179857 i think that its something that at times the media tried to make more of
8179858 weve always watched them as we watch all the other groups
8179859 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out

8179877 i cant wait to process the data from this internet gambling free zones survey and see where everything stands
8179878 im excited to be releasing news about recent internet gambling free zones item developments
8179879 and we believe this new institution of higher learning will have a great impact
8179880 dont get left out in the cold when it comes to internet gambling free zones technology
8179881 get good deals and second hand hardware when you can
8179882 het is waar dat we zeker een basis engels zouden moeten kennen
8179883 wanneer we winnen moeten we onze reactie in het engels kunnen geven maar vaak ben je op dat moment ook zo opgewonden dat je helemaal niet in het engels denkt
8179884 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses but just for short term liquidity purposes
8179885 problem list of banks increased 30 percent in the second quarter to the highest total in five years as more commercial real estate loans were overdue
8179886 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen
8179887 the results were pretty dismal and we dont see a return to the high earnings levels of previous years any time soon
8179888 riskier institutions so that safer institutions wont be unduly burdened she said
8179889 its kind of surreal to be playing in an atmosphere like here where there are national implications
8179890 my goal was to start from the bottom and work my way up
8179891 whenever i put my heart into something and put my best foot forward i have a great opportunity to come out ahead
8179892 if i make a decision with my best interests at heart its never a bad decision
8179893 i sent them my highlight film and they got back to me and it kind of snowballed from there
8179894 any college football fan should be in awe of the history of the football program
8179895 i remember mike denbrock told me there would be a guy coming in that we needed to talk to
8179896 he came in and looked great on the hoof he started a little slow in camp but hes whittled off about 20 pounds and with that started to come the athleticism you were hoping for
8179897 he said he was tough and he is hes going to be a nice addition hes going to play a little bit this year i guarantee you hes gotten a lot better this last week that was a nice addition there we were a little thin
8179898 i think we knew when we saw some film of when he played at drake that he had some talent and could maybe translate to this level i think it ended up the best way it possibly could for both parties we benefit he benefits and hopefully our team benefits too
8179899 so whenever they call my name on saturday ill be ready
8179900 lartichaut cest bien parce qu y en a plus dans lassiette apr s quavant

8179902 wanneer we winnen moeten we onze reactie in het engels kunnen geven maar vaak ben je op dat moment ook zo opgewonden dat je helemaal niet in het engels denkt
8179903 services are generally of a lower quality in areas where families are experiencing high levels of deprivation
8179904 its particularly encouraging to note that where we found inadequate provision in previous inspections these settings have improved significantly
8179905 however there is still more to do to ensure that outcomes for all children are of a consistently high standard and that every child has access to the same quality care particularly in areas where provision is generally poorer
8179906 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8179907 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8179908 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry
8179909 you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8179910 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8179911 she asked clinton was the featured speaker of the second night of the convention and she followed a series of other democrats to the podium who had ripped into republican mccain as indifferent to the working class and cozy with big oil if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8179912 its time to bring our jobs back and bring our troops home
8179913 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8179914 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8179915 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8179916 i know were at the democratic national convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it
8179917 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade

8179922 we just wanted to give our institutions a heads up that our examiners are going to be focusing on this area
8179923 that was probably the biggest problem in the past few years that our leadership was a little weak
8179924 we didnt always have those guys who took control we expect everyone to get to meetings on time work hard in practice and not give up
8179925 you can fold it in and let another bad season happen or you can get active about it and make the situation better
8179926 fortunately our team has decided that we wont accept another season like that
