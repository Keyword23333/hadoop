3700045 provi solamente a pensare cosa significhi dover fare una predica ogni domenica
3700046 sono molte le vie attraverso cui i nostri discorsi si intasano di formule che suonano forse altisonanti ma sono vuote e comunque inefficaci dal punto di vista del farsi capire
3700047 la differenza fra un pastore e un attore proprio il momento esistenziale che il pastore sia povero quando predica sulla povert che sia schernito quando predica di sopportare gli scherni mentre lattore ha precisamente il compito dingannare eliminando il momento esistenziale il pastore ha precisamente il compito nel senso pi profondo di predicare con la sua vita
3700048 il predicatore parli chiarozzo chiarozzo acci che chi ode ne vada contento e illuminato e non imbarbagliato
3700049 ammonisco ed esorto gli stessi frati che nella loro predicazione le loro parole siano ponderate e caste a utilit ed edificazione del popolo annunciando ai fedeli i vizi e le virt la pena e la gloria con brevit di discorso poich il signore disse sulla terra parole brevi

3700080 our business model is very much a response to what we see as a need for a democratisation of the top level of digital printing with more and more people becoming familiar with photoshop a sharp rise in the profile of digital art and design and an increasing number of photographers even retouching their own work people simply needed the ability to access resources that until now had only been available to a very select few just as we have made our colour profiles available for download we have attempted with theprintspace com to open up our systems to become platforms for user innovation theprintspace is about enabling our clients to act as prosumers to have full creative control over every aspect of their work from start to finish while we provide guidance and assistance whenever it is appropriate
3700081 our whole culture is changing because of digital information is becoming decentralised we need to recognise this change in the industry and facilitate that change and thats essentially what were doing at theprintspace photographers have become well versed in using these technologies so it makes sense to provide and manage the infrastructure for them to use the best possible technologies available
3700082 we regret the timing of this announcement but we were not made aware of the guidance until forty one days after our independent registered public accounting firm received communication on this issue from the sec these non cash write downs or paper loss adjustments are frustrating because substantially all of the issuers in these securities are paying principal and interest as agreed and are expected to do so until maturity the bottom line is that we remain a well capitalized institution and these revisions take nothing away from our core bank operating results for the second quarter

3700096 as we have seen just this year polygamy is not merely a utah problem recent enforcement efforts have shown that polygamists have set up shop in states around the country such as arizona nevada texas and others
3700097 i look forward to hearing the witnesses testimonies concerning the tools and means they are using to effectively crack down on those who practice polygamy
3700098 the hearings focus is not on polygamy itself but crimes associated with it prosecutors and ex fundamentalist lds church members will be among those testifying
3700099 victims of polygamy assistance act of 2008 bill because it will not and cannot serve our families in any healthy or meaningful way but will injure them
3700100 victims of polygamy assistance act of 2008 would establish a task force to focus on abuse extortion witness tampering embezzlement and other illegal activities suspected to be associated with polygamous groups according to reids office
3700101 the federal government has a duty to help fight the serious state and federal crimes committed by these groups
3700102 my bill will improve federal enforcement create a stronger federal state partnership and help the victims of abuse get out of these situations so they can start a new life
3700103 when we first started speaking publicly it was because nobody was speaking from our perspective
3700104 theres a lot of diversity there are people who are happy and functional and doing well blended in society there are some who are struggling there are some having difficulty because they are on the receiving end of bias there are some in abusive situations who dont feel like they can turn to anti polygamists we came to the conclusion there was a need for principle voices
3700105 one thing led to another we thought maybe by organizing wed have a little more credibility
3700106 we could also provide an avenue for those in our culture to speak up
3700107 that was a thrill to see people who havent seen each other for years sit around in my living room
3700108 it seemed like up to that time the groups stayed to themselves they realized that we can do this we can work together we can make a difference
3700109 because of the fact that we are speaking up it helps them be even more protected because they dont have to and yet the message gets out
3700110 a lot of the problems have been created by isolation and a lack of dialogue and information going back and forth
3700111 the polygamists werent talking to government government wasnt talking to polygamists we wouldnt have been able to solve a lot of problems and help a lot of victims had it not been for that open communication
3700112 there are adults who have chosen this freely among consenting adults
3700113 it doesnt work for everybody thats why you get the negative voices of those who had a bad experience they have every right to tell their story as well but our story wasnt being heard for years and years
3700114 principle voices has appeared to be more progressive in terms of opening up the communication pathways
3700115 weve always gotten calls to provide clinical services for polygamous communities but not all of the polygamous communities knew of our services more people have called us not only wanting services but asking questions that is wonderful
3700116 if we dont speak up then people are going to continue to believe the lies and stereotypes
3700117 they principle voices are responsible for pulling down those walls and those lies and fears
3700118 it exists in every community and we didnt feel it served our purpose to deny any of that but to be open and up front it helped the communities stop hiding because of their fear of polygamy being blamed
3700119 its against the law but its one area they feel they have to break the law
3700120 they can educate us and hopefully theres things we can do for them
3700121 im excited to see some of the steps theyve taken
3700122 i guess they would also learn they need to do things differently im excited theyre speaking publicly and defending themselves and giving their side of the story so people can have perspective
3700123 thats not an area where we can come to an agreement but there are areas where we can work together and we can agree
3700124 if i had a band aid i give it to you

3700132 were very encouraged with how weve been able to drive generic utilization for our members and consumers because we know that the use of generic medications is the most effective way to keep prescription drug spending manageable
3700133 a lack of blockbuster drugs in the pharmaceutical development pipeline along with increasing acceptance of generic drugs by consumers suggests that the low increase we saw during 2007 will be sustained for some time to come
3700134 dazu habe ich mal aus ein paar podcasts teile herausgeschnitten in denen es ber mich ging
3700135 in the first half of 2008 we made important progress with our genetic testing business a significant article was published in the journal human genetics that further supports the importance of interleukin genetics in determining the severity of diseases of inflammation and we launched our enhanced heart health test report package we also strengthened our management team and board of directors
3700136 in the coming months we expect to further advance our clinical programs for new genetic tests in our core focus areas and continue to roll out the improved report format and information package for our heart health and general nutrition tests to lead patients and physicians to create better more personalized treatments

3700140 we are very pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter of 2008
3700141 we continued to experience significant growth in all of our major markets we are particularly pleased to see our business in india growing rapidly along with the continued expansion of our business in the chinese bus market we are also very satisfied that our efforts to improve our gross margins continue to produce positive results as our margins remain well above last years level although we expect to continue to make progress in all of these areas during the second half of the year we can also see certain challenges ahead first due to the implementation of new emission standards in the china as of july 1st 2008 we believe there may be a trend on the part of chinese oems to increase orders in the first half of the year which may have a significant downward impact on oem orders during the second half of the year secondly due to government mandated traffic control related to the olympics some of our key customers will halt production during the third quarter it is difficult at this time to project the precise impact these factors while we still expect to have a strong year it is possible we will not be able to duplicate the growth rate of the second quarter

3700172 the exceptional accuracy of the qtinno tm tool was clearly validated by this third and most challenging clinical study to date the evidence unequivocally demonstrates that the qtinno tm is not only faster at measuring the qt interval compared to current manual and semi automated approaches but that it also provides proven levels of accuracy even in challenging conditions and with complex compounds we believe it provides an important additional independent validation that will help potential customers recognize the value of newcardios cardiac assessment tool in aggregate the three independent studies collectively provide newcardio with a robust clinical validation portfolio that demonstrates qtinno tm accuracy and precision in measuring key drug safety metrics across a broad range of compounds and in comparison to a variety of manual and semi automated gold standard measurements from three different sources
3700173 the company is now actively pursuing commercial validation of qtinno tm and is in discussion with potential cro partners we also anticipate developing an interface to discuss these important and compelling clinical validation data with drug regulators we will soon augment our senior management team in an effort to add sales and marketing leadership to accelerate the commercialization initiative
3700174 though agricultural commodity prices have moderated they remain quite favorable by historical standards and are continuing to provide strong support to farm incomes and to the sale of productive farm machinery worldwide

3700178 we are pleased to have entered into this license agreement for oraldna to market our pst r genetic test as a determinant of risk for periodontal disease we believe that this relationship will allow our sales of this important product to grow with a sales force that specifically targets dental practices in addition we expect that this agreement with oraldna labs will enable our core strategy of growth through partnerships and should allow interleukin genetics to build a customer base to provide additional test services
3700179 we are very excited to be working with interleukin genetics and adding the pst r genetic test to our portfolio of diagnostic tests performed in our new u s based laboratory we believe that by combining our myperiopath test which identifies specific pathogenic bacteria causing an infection within the gum structure with the pst r genetic test we are providing the dental community with the proper tools to identify and treat periodontal disease the combination of both tests creates a systematic way to track and maximize clinical outcomes for dental professionals and their patients as we continue to understand the systemic link and risk factors associated with periodontal disease its important that we partner with companies who like us are focused on helping dental professionals identify and treat disease at its earliest onset
3700180 we are delighted to have caxton advantage and hbm two premier health care funds lead this financing

3700191 second quarter adjusted eps from continuing operations were 0 09 in what remains a very challenging macroeconomic environment although expected our partnered brands net sales and total company operating margin results were disappointing this was offset by demonstrated progress on a number of fronts in particular we generated an 18 net sales increase in our retail based direct brands segment driven by a 13 comp store sales increase in juicy couture and a 5 comp store sales increase in lucky brand we realized tangible benefits from our streamlining activities in the second quarter as evidenced by the 22 million year over year reduction in adjusted sg amp a we also reaped the benefits of our focus on working capital as evidenced by the 26 reduction in inventory compared to last year this enables a clean transition into the second half and begins to position us well for the 2009 re launch of our flagship liz claiborne brand under the design direction of isaac mizrahi and the re launch of our claiborne mens business with john bartlett as well
3700192 while our second quarter results exceeded our conservative expectations the difficult macroeconomic environment causes us to be cautious in our outlook as we proceed through the second half of the year accordingly we are narrowing our fiscal 2008 adjusted eps guidance range resulting in a new range of 1 40 to 1 50 compared to the previous range of 1 40 to 1 60 for the third quarter of 2008 we expect adjusted eps to be in the range of 0 37 to 0 42
3700193 we are currently in the execution phase of our turnaround we have built strong brand teams and are accelerating initiatives that we believe will result in a solid and consistently profitable company our focus on improving cash management productivity and operating margin represent big opportunities for us as we move forward we are not expecting a significant macroeconomic recovery in the near future but will continue to prudently execute our plans implementing very meaningful product initiatives and driving operating margin expansion
3700194 while other payroll companies continue to compete with insurance brokers we are committed to offering our clients with best of breed partners such as emerson reid through our dedicated broker channel
3700195 doing so allows paylocity to continue our focus on our clients payroll and human resource needs while still having the capabilities of offering the ancillary services they desire such as 401k programs and insurance needs being experts in their specialized fields leaves us free to concentrate solely on our bread and butter payroll time and labor and human resources
3700196 we are pleased to bring such a strategic partner to our network of brokers todays client is looking to their broker as an advisor on the wide breadth of employee related products paylocity allows our brokers to bring a trusted vendor who understands the value of the insurance advisor to their clients
3700197 paylocitys flagship product paylocity webpay seamlessly integrates with most benefit enrollment systems including emerson reids worklife manager this allows our clients to choose the best possible solution in the market without giving up any of the integration they normally would have to
3700198 as we continue to see demands for these integrated solutions grow we will need superlative partnerships such as this emerson reid fits the mold perfectly

3700207 the north south divide is not a transient problem that reflects a short lived hiatus as manufacturing declines and service sector economies take its place
3700208 nor does it reflect a failure of government policy to do what is needed
3700209 rather it is evidence that the north the powerhouse of the industrial revolution is now a less desirable location for business for reasons that are geographical and entirely outside its control or that of central and local government
3700210 liverpool was once a booming city made rich on the cotton trade
3700211 manchester leeds and newcastle all have decided strengths but they are not successful enough to deliver prosperity to neighbouring towns such as rochdale bradford and sunderland in the way that london is able to support relatively poor communities in north kent and south essex
3700212 it is hard to see the wider manchester area as short of housing
3700213 it would be odd to expand the city dramatically when there is so little demand for housing in nearby towns

3700242 the panel came up for auction in sothebys and the story the collector gave to us is that he used to put ads in the local newspapers asking for wood and sometime in the 50s he had a response from a farm in monmouthshire
3700243 he remembered taking the ferry across the river severn because this was of course before the severn bridge was built and driving to meet this farmer
3700244 the farmer wanted to show him a bed but just as he was leaving he said i have something in the cow shed that might interest you it was apparently one of the pieces of wood dividing the cow sheds
3700245 the collector gave him a fiver put it in the car and took it home
3700246 extremely good condition for its age and given its unusual history
3700247 the panel shows us that he must have quite radically brought the castle up to date i think its a celebration of him becoming an earl
3700248 it is at the very height of court style for the late 1510s early 1520s it opens our eyes to a phase of history at the castle we were unaware of

3700284 we recognize that the right to bear arms is an important part of the american tradition and we will preserve americans continued second amendment right to own and use firearms we believe that the right to own firearms is subject to reasonable regulation but we know that what works in chicago may not work in cheyenne we can work together to enact and enforce common sense laws and improvements like closing the gun show loophole improving our background check system and reinstating the assault weapons ban so that guns do not fall into the hands of terrorists or criminals acting responsibly and with respect for differing views on this issue we can both protect the constitutional right to bear arms and keep our communities and our children safe
3700285 investment in the arts is an investment inn our creativity and cultural heritage in our diversity in our communities and in our humanity we support art in schools and increased public funding for the national endowment for the arts and the national endowment for the humanities we support the cultural exchange of artists around the world spreading democracy and renewing americas status as a cultural and artistic center

3700287 the desktop pc market around the world weakened during the quarter and our miscalculation of competitive price position further pressured our desktop gpu business we have a great product line up and having taken the necessary pricing actions we are strongly positioned again our focus now is to drive cost improvements and to further enhance our competitiveness through the many exciting initiatives we have planned for the rest of the year
3700288 in contrast the rest of our businesses did not exhibit the same dynamics as our desktop business the notebook gpu mcp and professional solutions groups grew a combined 27 percent year over year though we approach the near term with caution we remain very optimistic about the expanding universe of visual computing and the exciting growth opportunities made possible by cuda our general purpose parallel computing architecture

3700292 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
3700293 the only result of the use of air strikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism if the international community focuses on the terrorists bases hideouts and places where they are being trained and financed the problem is going to solved
3700294 i cannot foresee a winning outcome in afghanistan without resolving the sanctuaries in the tribal areas of pakistan
3700295 i cant see a viable level of afghan government authority developing here while there are still all these militant sanctuaries across the border

3700298 of course google is booming and the traditional portals are struggling but the numbers are stark last year googles advertising revenue of 6 billion was roughly the same as that of yahoo aol and microsoft combined googles growth is slowing but it continues to be a juggernaut emarketer estimates that ad revenue at google will increase by 32 percent this year that makes it the only one of these four companies that will grow faster than the ad market as a whole which is estimated to expand by 23 percent this year to be sure the uncertain economy makes any predictions especially suspect this year but the relative trends appear stable mating games of the big internet companies this graph raises the question does combining two past their prime giants that are both losing market share really solve any problems

3700308 and i was looking at him my boy and then he said its true man bernie mac passed
3700309 we need to accept above all that we cannot guarantee to regenerate every town and every city in britain that has fallen behind just as we cant buck the market so we cant buck economic geography either places that enjoyed the conditions for creating wealth in the coal powered 19th century often do not do so today port cities had an advantage in an era when exporting manufactured goods by sea was a vital source of prosperity today the sea is a barrier to their potential for expansion and they are cut off from the main road transport routes more generally the economic pull of europe has boosted the south east at the expense of the north wales and scotland luck has also played its part in 1900 london had finance and manchester had cotton finance has since prospered and cotton collapsed reinforcing geographical changes there is no realistic prospect that our regeneration towns and cities can converge with london and the south east there is however a very real prospect of encouraging significant numbers of people to move from those towns to london and the south east we know that the capital and its region are economic powerhouses that can grow and create new high skilled high wage service sector hubs at the same time market mechanisms can be used to induce some firms to move out of the south east
3700310 we know that the south east offers the greatest agglomeration potential so it makes sense to think seriously about having more than one large city in the south east where london has dominated for so long we also know that cities based on highly skilled workers are the most dynamic oxford and cambridge are unambiguously britains leading research universities outside london and both are well located economically we should consider expanding both dramatically just as liverpool and manchester expanded in the 19th century dynamic economies require dynamic economic geography of course there are successful high tech clusters outside the south east and it is right that they should build on their strengths but in many cases that does not imply huge expansion manchester leeds and newcastle for example all have decided strengths but they are not successful enough to deliver prosperity to neighbouring towns such as rochdale bradford and sunderland in the way that london is able to support relatively poor communities in north kent and south essex
3700311 bernies not the guy thats going to take the day off because hes sick
3700312 i went to see him in the hospital and even when he was in the hospital he was still bernie and he came back to work and he was on oxygen and actually came to work and between takes was on oxygen and he would take the oxygen mask off and do a take and then put the oxygen back on because he couldnt get enough oxygen into his lungs
3700313 i think bernie was too busy living to worry about not living i dont know if he was worried about his health but i know he was a hard enough working man that he came to work with an oxygen tank on that he would take off between takes because he wanted to be there to support everybody
3700314 we had no idea for the longest time and even then he showed up at work like trying to pass it off it was no big deal
3700315 i came across the rumble strips through their cover of back to black and amy and i agreed it was kind of better than our own
3700316 i picked up their album and fell in love with it then i decided i wanted to sign them to my label and work on their next album it was really as straightforward as that were all very excited about this
3700317 there are thousands of models like all the other thousands of models naomi campbell is the same way for me models are just pieces of wood that i carve to make clothes look beautiful
3700318 adam is in outstanding shape he works out an hour a day and walks with his big dog on his farm in sun valley idaho
3700319 he is not definite yet but is one of the people they are seriously looking at they will decide on everyone on aug 25
3700320 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby
3700321 im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3700322 i have never texted or emailed senator obama and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise
3700323 in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
3700324 i would hope that my friend obamas republican rival john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics
3700325 although i support senator obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me
3700326 i had spoken with him probably in the last you know maybe about the last three weeks and he was definitely talking about producing some more movies and he planned on producing some other movies he had even looked at doing television again
3700327 bernie was too big out there he was too big on stage for bernie mac not to tell jokes again not to stand on the stage with a microphone a bar stool a spotlight and a bottle of water i cant even see that you know
3700328 fans expect these types of movies to be more true to the source material
3700329 theres no reason there couldnt be a conan movie every two years hes almost like batman hes a dark hero hes a hard hero he has to be badass but we also have to like him
3700330 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3700331 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3700332 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3700333 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3700334 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3700335 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3700336 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3700337 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3700338 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3700339 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3700340 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3700341 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3700342 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3700343 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3700344 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3700345 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3700346 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3700347 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3700348 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3700349 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3700350 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3700351 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3700352 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3700353 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3700354 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3700355 i dont expect that the million will ever be won simply because there is no confirming evidence for any paranormal claims to date
3700356 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time

3700367 im not smiling at you im trying not to laugh
3700368 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3700369 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3700370 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3700371 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3700372 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3700373 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3700374 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3700375 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

3700377 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3700378 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3700379 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3700380 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3700381 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3700382 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3700383 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3700384 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3700385 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3700386 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3700387 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3700388 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3700389 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3700390 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3700391 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3700392 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3700393 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3700394 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3700395 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3700396 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3700397 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

3700399 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3700400 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3700401 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3700402 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3700403 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3700404 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3700405 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3700406 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

3700437 once again philip morris international has been caught engaging in cigarette marketing that appeals to children in a developing country and that would not be tolerated in the united states and other wealthier nations
3700438 the issue isnt just whether philip morris international has violated philippine law but whether tobacco companies should be engaged in such youth oriented marketing anywhere philip morris international should immediately cease all such sponsorships and promotions in all countries

3700494 i would encourage all organisations impacted by these changes to examine the potential value of the offering and to contact sap to provide their feedback on this price increase
3700495 i would also encourage sap to reconsider this mandatory price rise so that organisations not requiring the extra level of support provided in enterprise support do not have to pay for features they do not require

3700520 has appropriately raised serious concerns about the safety of prescribing over the internet

3700522 innovation technology and current medical practice all factor into the outcome of this study

3700532 one of the curious ironies of the nhs and many other health systems like it is that it does not pay enough attention to health focusing instead on ill health and disease the nhs diagnoses and treats rather than predicts and prevents
3700533 the government needs to shift this balance as the increasing cost of lifestyle related diseases such as diabetes obesity and some forms of cancer will prove financially unsustainable making the nhs unaffordable
3700534 changing peoples behaviour is difficult and merely giving people information and advice is known to be ineffective
3700535 bold action on the part of the government should include taking tough action to control levels of fat sugar and salt in foods as well as trying to narrow the income gap between rich and poor
3700536 the nhs faces some key wicked issues to which there are no easy or ready solutions these issues are very much focused on the way the health care is funded prioritised and managed and how it has evolved over the years
3700537 there is a fixation on the latest fads and fashion in management combined with a terror by target culture which has resulted in low staff morale and a breakdown in relations between clinicians and managers

3700554 we now have 15 trade unions country and regional groupings within the wto which are powerful coalitions who negotiate on the nitty gritty of trade
3700555 agreements including tariff levels and other obligations are tailored to take into account sensitivities of members and this is one of the reasons why wto agreements are so complex

3700626 when i was young cancer was one of those words i did not even like to hear if i came across an inevitable article delineating symptoms i would search my body and its reactions for the merest hint of their presence one day decades later when i had retired i found a hard lump in my groin my home doctor calmly asserted that we should wait two weeks and see what developed on the return visit he looked again noted that the lump did not move and advised me there was a 50 50 chance that it was serious i went through both needle and surgical biopsies the results were positive i had always envisioned myself collapsing into a spasm of uncontrollable fear were i to receive such news that did not happen i didnt dance for joy or fall back on disingenuous philosophies of reassurance but neither did i dissolve into quivering apprehension a gaggle of medical visits blood draws x rays ct scans and mris ensued i guess laughter helped as for the most part my wife and i laughed quite a bit at the comic wigs and gaudy kerchiefs i tried on in expectation of effects from the chemotherapy i was to undergo i dont think that this experience broadened me or made me more sensitive it happened and i luckily found doctors who battled my cancer and have kept it in remission for some years now i was fortunate that the lymphoma proved treatable i am grateful for those good years but i battled nothing those who treated me and those who researched and discovered treatments battled for me
3700627 we cant give any schedules or dates but the iraqi government sees the suitable date for withdrawal of the u s forces is by the end of 2010
3700628 political power is the central issue in insurgencies and counterinsurgencies each side aims to get the people to accept its governance or authority as legitimate
3700629 the long term goal is to leave a government able to stand by itself in the end the host nation has to win on its own eventually all foreign armies are seen as interlopers or occupiers the sooner the main effort can transition to host nation institutions without unacceptable degradation the better
3700630 there hasnt been an attack on a refugee camp in two years
3700631 what the aid groups want is eufor troops standing guard outside their doors at night
3700632 there are some problems but there are not very many problems
3700633 about the non respect of civilian and nonmilitary nature of the camps
3700634 especially as this is linked to the recruitment of people either enforced or even voluntary it is completely unacceptable to unhcr but it has happened it continues to happen and it will continue to happen
3700635 our expectation and hope now is that with the deployment of eufor we will have more capacity to give more sustainable more reliable solutions to this kind of problem
3700636 one of the most celebrated antipoverty programs of recent decades
3700637 were amazed and deflated to see how perfectly the two data sets fit together
3700638 if you look at cities throughout the country from 1990 to 2000 you see a consistent pattern of increases in poverty in the inner ring suburbs while the central cities had declines since poverty and crime are correlated you would expect that inner ring suburban crime went up and central city crime went down but thats only a statistical artifact of changing neighborhood composition rather than a causal effect of poverty on crime the correlation of crime and poverty old news to be sure is the only thing demonstrated by the map in the article nobody likes maps more than me but sometimes they just confuse correlation and causality
3700639 poverty began to decentralize in memphis between 1990 and 2000 it is important to acknowledge that neither hope vi redevelopment most of which occurred after 2000 nor vouchers which did not increase much until after 2000 materially affected what was happening from 1990 to 2000
3700640 rosin links the reduction of crime in new york city to its rising rents forcing poor families using section 8 vouchers to move to new jerseys cities and suburbs where crime is growing in fact fewer than 240 families have used vouchers to move from new york city to new jersey
3700641 demonizing the high rises has blinded some city officials to what was good and necessary about the projects and what they ultimately have to find a way to replace the sense of belonging the informal economy the easy to access social services and for better or worse the fact that the police had the address
3700642 the fundamental truth remains that senator mccain was right about the surge and senator obama was wrong we would not be in the position to discuss a responsible withdrawal today if senator obamas views had prevailed
3700643 a growing concern that the u s would leave iraq and leave the sunnis defenseless against al qaeda and iranian supported militias made these younger leaders open to our overtures
3700644 what capital gains does someone who starts a restaurant or shoe store have
3700645 thats why iran gave hezbollah the missiles to deter israel
3700646 a guarantee that neither the americans nor the world intends to overthrow the regime
3700647 liberal or popular historians dont seem to be very interested in conservative history and ideology
3700648 hold up a mirror to the prejudice and dark imaginings about barack obamas both obamas past and their politics
3700649 depicting the concept would show it as the fear mongering ridiculousness that it is
3700650 almost exactly the sort of cover you could expect to find on the front of national review
3700651 if we ran the exact same art the consensus from the liberal establishment could be summarized in words like
3700652 its a sad state of affairs that conservatives are hard to satirize or parody because theyre so insane but thats where we are
3700653 given the flare ups surrounding race and representation that have rocked the 2008 presidential race its easy to treat the satirical cover of a be turbaned barack and a be afroed michelle obama and other
3700654 drawing a black man either seriously or satirically it appears is damned difficult
3700655 maybe it is true that america is far too dim witted to handle a little bit of cartooning
3700656 liberal creatives are having a field day this election season with their depictions of michelle obama proving that you can revel in racist depictions of black people as long as you have a really good reason
3700657 the use of irony meant to denigrate anothers person race or ethnicity under the guise of being urbane witty meaning
3700658 we know that prevention is the key to reducing unwanted pregnancies but instead of putting prevention and sound science first the bush administration is once again putting ideology first and trying to block access to family planning services
3700659 standard democratic boilerplate language to summarize my pro choice position
3700660 suggested that i would fight right wing ideologues who want to take away a womans right to choose
3700661 if you truly believe that those who oppose abortion are all ideologues driven by perverse desires to inflict suffering on women then you in my judgment are not fair minded
3700662 that night before i went to bed i said a prayer a hope that we can live with one another in a way that reconciles the beliefs of each with the good of all
3700663 god promises victory over evil to those who choose him

3700666 with some of the laws being passed in california gods judgment is looming so they will be crying out for his mercy
3700667 an extraordinary realization there is now not a single area of campaigning not organizing not message development not candidate recruitment and training not fundraising and certainly not ruthlessness at which republicans are not demonstrably better than democrats
3700668 as of may 31 the obama campaign staff was well over twice the size of the bush re election campaign staff in 2004 and nearly three times the size of mccains current staff and has expanded significantly since
3700669 the greatest earned media i e press coverage candidate in history

3700695 theres a perception that public housing is being dealt with when it actually isnt
3700696 the capital funding thats needed to renovate and recapitalize is about 30 billion in the hole
3700697 the one thing weve shown conclusively is building a large public housing development and isolating it in a poor racially segregated neighborhood is bad
3700698 there has been a national study done that the effect of having a voucher for welfare populations has reduced homelessness by 75 percent
3700699 affordable housing public housing particularly although it seems to be on the interests of most mayors in the country hasnt caught the congress interest
3700700 when i mention the revitalization of the neighborhoods here in the district what that translates into is new supermarkets and new revitalized schools less public safety issues
3700701 a lot of overblown rhetoric about homeownership and the fact is that rental housing is peoples homes we need to recognize that

3700710 were one bomb away from getting rid of that obnoxious court
3700711 more than 3 000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries many others have met a different fate
3700712 lets put it this way they are no longer a problem to the united states and our friends and allies
3700713 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people
3700714 that is simply not the way in which international relations can be run in the 21st century
3700715 weve got to make sure that the russians realise that they do have rights in the international system but they must be allied with responsibilities
3700716 and when responsibilities are not upheld there are political consequences for russia
3700717 its unprecedented since the g8 became the g8 in the 1990s for seven countries to come together without an eighth country but that has happened over the last few days and i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3700718 why with the euro so high do the germans put so much more effort into manufacturing
3700719 the germans arent doing much the only reason theyre ahead of us is that were just doing nothing i mean we arent developing any new products while the germans occasionally they try something its all the bean counters the financial people
3700720 for the entirety of its 74 year history until 2008 the commission has never brought an enforcement action of this kind
3700721 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and the people in my life who matter most my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent
3700722 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3700723 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3700724 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3700725 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3700726 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation

3700734 maybe we need to have our own kind of queer marriage make it known that we dont want to be a part of a society that doesnt accept us or embrace us even hates us a lot of queer people want to just have the same rights and be treated the same as their hetero counterparts inclusion is the ultimate goal for a lot of folks i havent quite decided where i stand

3700806 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3700807 it would feel better if it were gold but were really proud we got the silver
3700808 i still feel we are equally good with the chinese
3700809 she definitely blames herself for it but we keep telling her things happen
3700810 but i think i would feel a little bit better with myself if i didnt make those two mistakes
3700811 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3700812 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3700813 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3700814 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3700815 there is nobody in our sport that can win like he wins
3700816 he is not just winning he is crunching world records
3700817 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3700818 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3700819 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3700820 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3700821 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3700822 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
3700823 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3700824 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3700825 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3700826 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3700827 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3700828 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3700829 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3700830 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3700831 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3700832 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
3700833 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3700834 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3700835 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3700836 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3700837 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3700838 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3700839 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap
3700840 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3700841 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3700842 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3700843 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3700844 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3700845 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3700846 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3700847 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3700848 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3700849 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3700850 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3700851 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3700852 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3700853 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3700854 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3700855 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3700856 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3700857 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

3700863 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3700864 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3700865 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

3700871 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 y la declaraci n de las naciones unidas esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3700872 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3700873 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3700874 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
3700875 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
3700876 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n

3700911 im impressed with the fact that the shareholders trust the bank enough to invest their money in the bank
3700912 more efforts should be made to upgrade the financial reporting standards of the bank the bank belongs to shareholders so they must protect the banks interest

3700936 una cosa es que tengamos derechos y otra es que se cumplan y esta sentencia ayudar a velar por los derechos de los trabajadores tanto en el plano laboral como en el personal como ha sido mi caso porque yo laboralmente no ten a problemas
3700937 es evidente que una empresa propiedad de la conferencia episcopal no es demasiado proclive ni al ascenso de las mujeres ni al reconocimiento de los derechos que tengan que ver con el mundo homosexual eso no cabe discutirlo
3700938 era un referente social para la clase trabajadora defensora de los derechos de las personas
3700939 fuimos un referente social insisti incluso desde una ptica cristiana que yo puedo respetar y respeto profundamente si la ptica cristiana no tiene nada que ver con los desprop sitos y barbaridades cometidos posteriormente
3700940 esa l nea ideol gica de defensa de los derechos de las personas y de los trabajadores en los a os 80 fue derivando poco a poco en un giro pol tico hacia la derecha m s radical tabernaria y espantosa que se pod a imaginar por lo que estoy doblemente contenta de no tener que regresar
3700941 obviamente s porque si las empresas no tuviesen la seguridad de que van a salir impunes en estos asuntos no pasar an a nadie se le ocurre agreg despedir a nadie porque es miope o moreno o bajito porque son circunstancias que nadie puede variar y es exactamente lo mismo en la orientaci n sexual porque no es una opci n a pesar de lo que se dice uno es lo que es
3700942 la empresa no puede decir ah es que usted es no s qu no mire yo ya lo era antes pero es que adem s eso no tiene nada que ver con mi trabajo
3700943 est claro que esto se puede hacer con bastante impunidad como hasta hace poco se pod a despedir sin problema alguno a una se ora por quedar embarazada porque a las empresas les resulta m s barato pagar un despido o una multa que respetar nuestros derechos
3700944 ahora tengo dos a os para replantearme mi vida pues est claro que con 45 a os es bastante complicado encontrar trabajo en el sector de la comunicaci n que est tan precarizado en mi caso usaron un becario para deshacerse de m y yo no voy a ser la becaria de nadie

3701139 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage

3701186 thats where nursing staff took these babies and left them to die
3701187 christ hospital and we now know other hospitals and clinics around the country are involved in an abortion procedure called induced labor abortion
3701188 my experience was that they the babies survive as short as a few minutes to once almost as long as an eight hour shift
3701189 to be clear these were living babies who were left out to die and they were issued both birth and death certificates according to illinois state law
3701190 when she told me what she was doing i couldnt bear the thought of this suffering child dying alone
3701191 and so i cradled and rocked him for the forty five minutes that he lived
3701192 was unmoved and actually opposed the born alive infant protection act
3701193 thought that infanticide was acceptable and voted to protect it some people said that barack obama was uninformed or may not have fully understood the implications of this bill but he voted against it three times thats calculated
3701194 as chairman of the health and human services committee in 2003 he stopped the identical wording from being introduced
3701195 barack obama can play word games but at the end of the day his opposition was responsible for living babies being left out to die and that is indefensible

3701202 we challenge dr stanton jones to submit his so called ex gay subjects to the no lie mri because we believe that ex gay ministries are consumer fraud and his reported study may be invalid our direct challenge is a unique opportunity for ex gay organizations to back up their outrageous tales of transformation and prove us wrong once and for all what are they afraid of
3701203 after several key ex gay leaders have been caught in sex scandals their tales of transformation lack credibility
3701204 it is folly to suggest that telephone interviews can be considered genuine research news organizations should avoid covering such a mockery of the scientific method
3701205 once you jump behind the skull there is no hiding
3701206 it seems that ex gays would rather mislead and practice skullduggery than get behind the skull
3701207 i hope they take our challenge and end the semantic games and phony studies used to propagate their political agenda
3701208 sales taxes came in a lot lower than expected were actually slightly lower than last year comparing the first quarters of the calendar year
3701209 the use of reason allows for a legitimate diversity in our prudential judgments
3701210 these choices include elective abortion euthanasia physician assisted suicide the destruction of embryonic human beings in stem cell research human cloning and same sex marriage
3701211 such acts are judged to be intrinsically evil that is evil in and of themselves regardless of our motives or the circumstances they constitute an attack against innocent human life as well as marriage and family
3701212 in light of the above we would commit moral evil if we were to vote for a candidate who takes a permissive stand on those actions that are intrinsically evil when there is a morally acceptable alternative
3701213 so when there is no choice of a candidate that avoids supporting intrinsically evil actions especially elective abortion we should vote in such a way as to allow the least harm to innocent human life and dignity
3701214 we would not be acting immorally therefore if we were to vote for a candidate who is not totally acceptable in order to defeat one who poses an even greater threat to human life and dignity

3701226 we have successfully completed the transition from our nighthunter ii high intensity illumination system with the introduction during the third quarter of our advanced nighthunter 3 device the performance of this new product during demonstrations for military customers has consistently exceeded expectations a number of military units have already submitted operational need statements requesting funding for purchases of nighthunter 3 production by our supplier perkin elmer is increasing steadily and we expect this new device to contribute to our results beginning in the current quarter
3701227 we also are pleased by the steady progress we are making in establishing our patented and proprietary supervision device as the night vision system of choice in our target markets more than 80 police departments and state and federal agencies throughout the country have purchased our high definition night vision system to date positive customer feedback and increasing re orders confirm our view that supervision offers a price performance profile unmatched by any other night vision technology

3701231 every time i look at phoebe i know i made the right decision i never wanted to end my babys life just because of how she came to be
3701232 everyone save for mum thought i should have an abortion
3701233 my dad even made an appointment at the clinic and they showed me the little blob on the scan i presume to convince me that it was just a mass of cells and the whole thing would be over quickly
3701234 anyone my age would want to have a baby rather than an abortion
3701235 i did and i dont regret it for a moment
3701236 having her in my life is such a joy from the first time i held her in my arms i have had this fierce bond with her a connection which started even before she was born she looks like me when i was her age and i feel strongly that she was meant to be a part of our family
3701237 while it was terrifying knowing that i was going to be a mum made me look forward and focus on something else i suppose i have tried to look beyond what happened to the life that was created
3701238 the big lottery fund award has come at just the right moment
3701239 its been a long wait but we believe the new hall will be like a heart transplant bringing a new lease of life for our community in the nick of time
3701240 we need to accept above all that we cannot guarantee to regenerate every town and every city in britain that has fallen behind just as we cant buck the market so we cant buck economic geography either places that enjoyed the conditions for creating wealth in the coal powered 19th century often do not do so today port cities had an advantage in an era when exporting manufactured goods by sea was a vital source of prosperity today the sea is a barrier to their potential for expansion and they are cut off from the main road transport routes more generally the economic pull of europe has boosted the south east at the expense of the north wales and scotland luck has also played its part in 1900 london had finance and manchester had cotton finance has since prospered and cotton collapsed reinforcing geographical changes there is no realistic prospect that our regeneration towns and cities can converge with london and the south east there is however a very real prospect of encouraging significant numbers of people to move from those towns to london and the south east we know that the capital and its region are economic powerhouses that can grow and create new high skilled high wage service sector hubs at the same time market mechanisms can be used to induce some firms to move out of the south east
3701241 we know that the south east offers the greatest agglomeration potential so it makes sense to think seriously about having more than one large city in the south east where london has dominated for so long we also know that cities based on highly skilled workers are the most dynamic oxford and cambridge are unambiguously britains leading research universities outside london and both are well located economically we should consider expanding both dramatically just as liverpool and manchester expanded in the 19th century dynamic economies require dynamic economic geography of course there are successful high tech clusters outside the south east and it is right that they should build on their strengths but in many cases that does not imply huge expansion manchester leeds and newcastle for example all have decided strengths but they are not successful enough to deliver prosperity to neighbouring towns such as rochdale bradford and sunderland in the way that london is able to support relatively poor communities in north kent and south essex
3701242 these discussions between the roman catholic church and the anglican communion have been going on for 42 years
3701243 we would like to bring these down to the local level
3701244 theres a very serious attempt on the part of episcopal clergy in the diocese of forth worth to petition rome for some kind of recognition
3701245 they make it clear that they no longer believe there is truth in the anglican communion and the only way they can find truth is reunion with rome

3701262 iron sky is a story about conformity those who want to conform those who want to make others conform and those who refuse to conform
3701263 with star wreck we learned how to gather large numbers of volunteers to break tasks down and create a film in a distributed manner
3701264 for our second film we decided to take all that knowledge and automate it
3701265 this is how sieg heil got started and no im not saying obama is hitler i just think people should be careful about slipping into a personality cult for a charismatic leader

3701267 people must never be forced to choose between food or medication the government must act now
3701268 this training provides police officers and partner agencies with a unique opportunity to learn about the issues surrounding internet and online safety and allows them to pass this knowledge on to schoolchildren and parents alike
3701269 it will allow us to educate young people of the risks associated with the internet
3701270 weve been going into schools for around two years now but we want to expand the number of people who can deliver this advice in schools we already educate youngsters about stranger danger in a public place and the internet is now a public place its part of everyday life this poses a huge problem
3701271 the internet is a very useful resource for our young people but unfortunately it has its dark side with unscrupulous and sometimes evil people trying to exploit youngsters
3701272 it is therefore extremely important that we highlight any risks that may be associated with it to try to protect young people
3701273 i am very thankful that the police have opened out this training course for the councils children and families staff
3701274 lynne would be so proud to see this this would not be happening if it hadnt been for the work lynne put into it
3701275 this is a great success its only a pilot but everything has to start somewhere and im glad we are finally seeing some success after all the work lynne put in
3701276 we were always keen on walking as a family but when we did lynne would be sitting on the pavement crying because she was exhausted and in so much pain
3701277 it has helped of course but none of this would be happening without lynne
3701278 the accused cornered her raised the screwdriver and thrust it at her head
3701279 he struck mrs asghar to the back of her neck before thrusting the screwdriver towards her hitting her on the back
3701280 all our thoughts are with his family at this time
3701281 we want to develop the facility into a top quality water sports hub for the city while reducing the carbon footprint of the building
3701282 swimming pools are big energy users so solar heating is definitely the way forward especially with rising fuel prices and the need to cut carbon emissions
3701283 this move is to be commended its exactly the type of green energy project we need to see more of in the city
3701284 the importance of children and young people enjoying their chosen sport whether it is an after school kick about or something more competitive is something that should be recognised
3701285 the findings show most adults can see how various measures like disclosure checks or child protection policies play a real part in keeping children safe
3701286 adults and children can enjoy sport together and we are delighted that adults are not being put off a really rewarding activity
3701287 scottish students seem to have been hit especially hard by the recent downturn in the economy our research shows that the price of the items students buy things like rent groceries entertainments have risen faster in scotland than the rest of the uk
3701288 scotland does remain relatively cheap though and the funding system for students is more generous
3701289 drawing is a metaphor for life its about constantly making mistakes and revising them in pursuit of the truth i plan to entertain and provoke by being brutally honest
3701290 the cpi central projection peaking close to or even at 5 per cent
3701291 i think the council is very vulnerable these decisions cannot stand and this could be an incredible outcome as a point of law of this
3701292 the councils financial involvement relates to commercial agreements on property which have been reported openly to the council
3701293 it is routine for public and privately owned land to be taken together for the sake of developments that benefit the city
3701294 we are obliged to raise market value on property we sell and we are comfortable that we have done that
3701295 consider the complaint in the light of the applicable community law
3701296 the old system that was used to decide what rent was paid for a property was seriously flawed and meant there was huge variation in rent levels for similar properties
3701297 this can hardly be seen as fair and this review has been the best possible solution to this problem by replacing 2000 different rent levels with nine we will inevitably make the process fairer and more transparent and bring it closer the scottish average
3701298 this camp was run by hizb e islami and there were about 15 people including foreigners there at the time of the attack
3701299 ive heard people ask why gordon doesnt smile well they used to say that about me but when you get into an airplane you dont look to see if the pilot is smiling you ask if he can take off and land the plane safely
3701300 a darkly satirical look at a world of compulsory id cards in britain
3701301 this is how we came to grief our protesters were unreasonably arrested merely for entering the carlton hotel in fancy dress costumes
3701302 the protest was entirely peaceful but clearly id cards have become such a hot potato that campaigners are having to watch every move they make
3701303 we are extremely grateful for the timely advice from no2id when we arrived in edinburgh we had no idea that our show would be so controversial as a result of the local sensitivities to id cards
3701304 i always enjoyed drama at school and set up a small theatre company when i was living in orkney
3701305 but apart from that i havent performed in 45 years when i was in three men in a boat
3701306 i found the language very interesting as it moves between medieval and 1930s english and i appreciate the irony of an snp councillor playing an english knight
3701307 weve had very good audiences so far there were more than 80 people there most nights my only concern is that im on the recruitment committee for the new head of planning on thursday and i may not get away in time for the performance
3701308 im not sure you can draw too many connections between us
3701309 we are ideally placed to challenge the world in the fringe
3701310 we have 21 wonderful people performing in murder in the cathedral and every one is essential to its success
3701311 with richard holloway being stabbed in the front rather than in the back as was his wont as becket were looking at a winning combination
3701312 i was thrilled to bits i watched the television all day yesterday and all day today he had two runs today in the first run he had a two second penalty and he had a brilliant second run which is why he did so well
3701313 she was absolutely thrilled and delighted for david hes been receiving his medal and has been talking to gaby roslin and hes been talking to his family
3701314 davids really far too sensible to hope for anything because he knew better than anybody that anything can happen he was focussed and he was thinking positively and he was well prepared hes spent the last four years working towards it i think hell carry on for 2012 but i dont know
3701315 i put in a good final run there and in the pressure of a big final it is the most exciting time to do it
3701316 it was a bit nerve wracking watching the guys follow i was happy i had done a good run and that was all that i could do a medal is what i have been after for the last four years
3701317 this is by far the biggest competition he has ever won he is capable of holding it together under these big conditions
3701318 i had a party at the golf club today we had several bottles of bubbly and it was very nice
3701319 further outbreaks of heavy rain will affect the area giving another 15 mm in three hours in places the public are advised to take extra care and refer to the latest scottish environment protection agency live flood warning information and also to traffic scotland for further advice on road conditions
3701320 the road down there is really bad for accidents there have been motorcyclists knocked off and even killed before
3701321 this is a fantastic boost for sport not just in bathgate but across west lothian
3701322 the tibetan protesters were in the park john ray was running behind them the police were running behind him
3701323 what has come to light is that junior doctors are putting on cremation certification c diff infection when this has not been the cause of death or has been sometime in the past this obviously gives false leading figures as to the prevalence of c diff and can be upsetting to relatives
3701324 obviously where c diff is the cause of death this needs to be recorded thus i would be grateful if consultants could discuss with their junior staff to improve the quality of death certification
3701325 while the paragraph was carefully worded the message was clear and has had the desired effect junior doctors are now afraid to note c diff on certificates for fear of the consequences to their careers
3701326 it is totally unacceptable for junior doctors to be given the impression that they may get into trouble with their employer if c difficile is the cause of death and that is what they put on the death certificate
3701327 its a nasty infection but its quite simple to identify so why there has to be such confusion around whether to list it or not i do not know
3701328 junior doctors are rotated on a regular basis as part of their training with the new intake reporting for duty with nhs lothian last week this note was a reminder for their supervisors
3701329 it is absolutely crucial for everyone patients and their families clinical staff that we get important things like filling out death certificates right
3701330 simply not the way that international relations can be run in the 21st century

3701354 coaches here want to see you do it when youre tired at the end of the game when its overtime
3701355 if you get complacent and you just settle for eight sacks or seven forced fumbles then where do you go from there now my goal is double digit sacks just because youre here doesnt mean you can just tail off
3701356 last year he was just trying to make the team now hes trying to be a starter hes competing really hard but i want him to take it to another level right now hes a third down player but hes good enough to play on every down
3701357 he played in the arena league and they dont have any tight ends there
3701358 so he hadnt lined up against a tight end for a long time until he came here last year in arena ball its really just rush rush rush thats a big adjustment
3701359 coaches here want to see you do it when youre tired at the end of the game when its overtime they want to see you do it from the first snap of the game to the 80th snap
3701360 he was cut by five different teams do you realize that

3701364 ive never been involved in a game like that before as a pro going wire to wire with no penalties or turnovers
3701365 those are the two things that stand out to me about tonights game and thats what we continue to emphasize around here winning edges
3701366 thats something our line takes a great deal of pride in keeping our defense fresh
3701367 converting on third and 1 is like making a statement tonight was nothing i havent seen from michael bennett before he just works hard and doesnt complain hes consistent and before you know it hes going to give you that big run
3701368 everyone in this room already knows how good michael bennett is
3701369 hes fast hes strong and hes got good vision fundamentally this was a very good game for us no penalties or turnovers thats what you want we didnt do the little things that get you beat in this league
3701370 we got into a good rhythm and when other guys came in they did a great job too
3701371 we had a good running game going tonight were going to watch the film today and there will be a lot to build on i thought we looked pretty good out there
3701372 it feels good to say i played my first game as a pro
3701373 just like i expected the speed of the game in the nfl is a lot faster
3701374 you really wont know until you sit down and watch the tape but id say it was ok
3701375 its only one game but our line has taken an extra step
3701376 we kept converting on short yardage tonight and we did it convincingly where you dont even have to bring out the sticks to measure
3701377 they were all young last year and they kind of got thrown into the fire and did really well now theyre a year older and adding jeff faine at center really helps the offensive line should be one of the strong points of our team all season long
3701378 you cant make a steak out of a pigs ear
3701379 really i wouldnt even have known by looking at him
3701380 why am i so stupid why do i have this cough i am dumb dumb dumb

3701383 in 1945 the nazis went to the moon in 2018 they are coming back
3701384 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3701385 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3701386 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3701387 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3701388 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3701389 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3701390 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3701391 present mram are programmed by pulses of about 10 nanoseconds duration
3701392 the next thing that needs to be done is to get the switching currents down to a scale that is compatible with the standard
3701393 on the podium i kept tearing up im almost at a loss for words its the most fun part of being part of a team its the best thing having four americans swim all well together
3701394 now for my question what exactly was finlands role in the second world war it just surprised me that finland would make a movie dealing with ww2 since they considered themselves fighting 3 separate wars
3701395 what a shitty trip that was but its over now
3701396 this was a game that i think potentially could have been a major downer for us
3701397 and we actually turned around and made it actually a great win
3701398 so the roller coaster ride in bostons always fun luckily we got the cheers at the end

3701415 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates

3701427 they looked very happy together i remember the bride looked very young and pale and quite angelic
3701428 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3701429 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3701430 new jersey voters may like their beaches but they also like being able to fill the tank and drive to the beaches
3701431 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3701432 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3701433 madonnas representatives have been visiting the girl the adoption is now advanced
3701434 then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
3701435 the adoption process in malawi is so long and stressful that all the legal wrangling put a huge strain on their marriage
3701436 they dropped proceedings to pour all their energies into each other but madonna now feels they are stable enough to press ahead with the adoption again
3701437 we know that it is mercy who madonna really wants we heard it is because my granddaughter is such a beautiful happy child
3701438 twice i have told the adoption people that i do not want mercy to go outside the country
3701439 but they keep on at us now they say that mercy will be leaving us but can return at age 18 yet i might not be alive then

3701444 we have coined 2008 the year of the ps3 and are confident that with the launch of littlebigplanet we will continue to see the momentum build throughout the end of this year and on to the next this is a very big title for us
3701445 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent
3701446 i have at all times tried to fair and honest with the students the faculty the staff and the community
3701447 at all times i have done what i have felt was in the best interests of the high school

3701449 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3701450 we started in my garage two years ago and were producing barrels today so things are moving pretty quickly
3701451 so these are bacteria that have been engineered to produce oil
3701452 they started off like regular lab bacteria that didnt produce oil but we took genes from nature we engineered them a bit and put them into this organism so that we can convert sugar to oil
3701453 if youve got something that you can make work in a test tube thats good but youve got to be able to make it work on a very large scale to have an impact on our petroleum imports
3701454 what weve done is make the same molecules from renewable sources so that it can go into the existing infrastructure be made domestically and in an environmentally friendly way thats the goal
3701455 you cant put ethanol in a pipeline and even your car needs some adjustments to it whereas the product were making is going into the existing system and thats a big difference
3701456 i doubt were going to completely eliminate our dependence on oil but well certainly be able to supplement the amount of oil we need in the short term
3701457 i think that the answer to reducing our petroleum import problem and reducing the carbon emissions from transportation is really threefold
3701458 it involves replacement fuels like biofuels it involves using much more efficient vehicles than we use today and it involves driving less
3701459 the fun of the challenge from the science perspective is that you do have farmers and biologists and entomologists and biochemists and chemical engineers and process engineers and business people and investors all working to solve this and it ranges anywhere from a political issue to a technical issue
3701460 honestly i couldnt think of a more exciting thing to work on as a scientist or technologist right now
3701461 part of the excitement comes from the fact that this is such a complex problem it cant be solved by a farmer or an ag expert and it cant be solved by a chemical engineer or a chemist
3701462 we all have to pool our various talents and training and try to come up with a whole new system of producing energy
3701463 and the current energy price environment has made literally everyone interested in replacements for petroleum
3701464 fans expect these types of movies to be more true to the source material
3701465 theres no reason there couldnt be a conan movie every two years hes almost like batman hes a dark hero hes a hard hero he has to be badass but we also have to like him

3701485 i am hoping they can make enough arrests to break them the drug dealers and gangs that might be wishful thinking because there are so many willing to come in because of the money i suppose is the draw
3701486 look at the shooting last week we had several arrests within hours and there are now a string of charges that will go before the courts
3701487 we know who the players are but we cant arrest them until they break the law
3701488 we supply the resources weve upped it constantly the allowable manpower strength is 128 but i doubt if we have any more than 120 or 122 so thats a challenge getting officers out of depot

3701554 only time will tell but i think weve turned a bit of a corner
3701555 one win isnt going to make a massive amount of difference but it could be a springboard and you can see the relief in the players in the dressing room

3701639 nobody can guarantee your life nor the fate of the material you will be collecting in baghdad

3701641 if you decide to continue with your intention then i am very sorry to tell you that taking the overall environment in my country i am not able to support your mission the main reason would be to preserve my life during or after it is concluded
3701642 i had made several important contacts in regards to your trip
3701643 as you know the situation inside iraq is very dangerous and confused and many people were hesitant to meet with you
3701644 they were afraid of what the americans might do if it was found out that they had met with you
3701645 they just disappeared into the shadows they are still very much a presence in baghdad and iraq
3701646 mr ritters life is at risk if he comes here as well as the life of any iraqi he meets with
3701647 if he does his life is at risk your life is at risk and everyone associated with his visits life will be at risk
3701648 i guess its just because you are who you are
3701649 george bush is in trouble our people did not find any wmd in iraq can you help us
3701650 can we prepare something for that we could bring in some nuclear material from the former soviet union and pretend they are iraqi

3701654 had someone in her family known about the abortion sarahs life could have been saved
3701655 we made some very very bold statements for example that no girl had ever been harmed by a parental notification law and planned parenthood was simply unable to come up with any evidence that that had ever happened
3701656 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the
3701657 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3701658 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat
3701659 hagel couldnt keep his mouth shut long enough to be somebodys no 2
3701660 its tough to be someones no 2 when youre used to making your own decisions
3701661 its just not responsible to be saying things like that
3701662 berall ist mehr drin aber man kann es aus heutiger sicht nicht versprechen wenn man sich das umfeld ansieht

3701683 colin is a truly modern artist not bound by any one style or approach but using his imagination and creativity to build music that cuts across sounds and genres he is a brilliant multi tasker a true one man band singer songwriter producer and performer from his urban based production work to his breakthrough kanye and u2 re mixes to his fantastic pop rock driven debut album he is an original and compelling artist i am thrilled to welcome colin into the universal motown family

3701688 as the government has maintained throughout it does not hypothecate revenue
3701689 that does not mean we do not spend on green initiatives but we do not assign different pots of revenue to do that it is important that government has flexibility to make spending decisions and decide upon its priorities
3701690 test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at
3701691 as each panelist began to tell their story the room became heavy there were so many narratives from loss of a loved one to social ills making life seem unbearable it was apparent that everybody was going through something
3701692 the question is how do insurers draw the line when the driver switches off the system do they switch it off legitimately because they are on their lunch hour or do they do it deliberately because they are about to commit a crime
3701693 other points of debate include the right for police or government agencies to ask for such data and how long the data should be kept if they ask for gps records from insurer because there is reason to believe a vehicle has been used for a crime
3701694 cost is directly linked to factors such as whether companies already have geodemographical systems in place and how they want to carry out integration

3701696 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
3701697 because of ethnic cleansing conducted in georgia by russia from 1993 to 2008
3701698 we can then look to the issue of how to resolve the longstanding frozen conflicts of south ossetia and abkhazia
3701699 that has been the case and that will continue to be the case
3701700 if u s attacks russia russia will use nuclear weapons
3701701 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
3701702 because of ethnic cleansing conducted in georgia by russia from 1993 to 2008
3701703 we can then look to the issue of how to resolve the longstanding frozen conflicts of south ossetia and abkhazia
3701704 that has been the case and that will continue to be the case
3701705 if u s attacks russia russia will use nuclear weapons
3701706 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
3701707 we want the eu to acknowledge the aggression by russia
3701708 we have to discuss and revise our negotiations because russias actions constitute a clear violation of international law and the united nations charter and such actions should have consequences
3701709 central and eastern european countries might like to take the opportunity to take a swipe at the russians as one would expect
3701710 they may put these things forward but i would not necessarily say thats going to be the outcome
3701711 appears to be to damage georgia militarily and economically to such an extent that its capacity to resist politically is severely weakened
3701712 south ossetians supported by russians are committing horrible massacres in georgian villages
3701713 in tbilisi i q users receive the message about provocations possibility
3701714 as i speak the russian tanks are attacking the town of gori and are rampaging through the town
3701715 americas oil shale resource exceeds 2 trillion barrels including about 1 5 trillion barrels of oil equivalent in high quality shale concentrated in the green river formation in colorado utah and wyoming depending on technology and economics as much as 800 billion barrels of oil equivalent could be recoverable from oil shale resources yielding more than 25 gallons per ton
3701716 my view is that the president should just take the position right now that these moratoriums will end on september the 30 th and the democrats have to be responsible for putting them back in
3701717 with all due respect president bush would have to sign the moratorium into law for it to exist
3701718 so if a bill passes congress that has that moratorium your belief is president bush your advice to him is mr president veto that bill
3701719 and my advice to him today would be to start the process up right now for what we do on oct 1 when this moratorium is ended and move forward assuming that there will be no moratorium after september the 30 th
3701720 you would tell him to instruct those people in the interior department who are responsible for administering these leases for the offshore oil and the shale oil to begin the process of getting ready so that on oct 1 he can sell a lease
3701721 and you would go ahead and sell those leases you would say lets do it lets move ahead
3701722 the studies are there the resource is there we know you can safely go after it the american people are hurting we need to do whatever is necessary
3701723 i think theres a limit to what one man can do and we have survived some pretty bad presidents in the past
3701724 having said that i am very concerned that he might get elected i think i came away from my meeting feeling that he was somewhat kind of a very typical very liberal democrat rather than the fact that he may be sort of a new breed of extremist which is how some of his critics kind of portray him
3701725 the police actually said you have to leave china now
3701726 ik voerde perfect het tactisch plannetje uit rustig meegaan me constant bij de eerste drie houden en indien het kan niet tot het alleruiterste gaan ik lag wel op koers om de zege te pakken maar toen ik zag dat de duitser marcel hacker het voor bekeken hield vond ik het ook welletjes
3701727 sprinten tegen krachtpatsers als karonen en tufte had me misschien wat winst kunnen opleveren maar evengoed krachten gekost die ik in de a finale best zal kunnen gebruiken blijkbaar waren alle skiffeurs in die tweede halve finale trager dat komt misschien door het rare wedstrijdverloop waardoor zelfs de nieuw zeelandse drievoudige wereldkampioen mahe drysdale de rol moest lossen
3701728 drysdale moest zich nog reppen om derde te finishen en de griek christou die een wildcard kreeg nog net uit de a finale te houden ik ga dus nu zeker niet beginnen dromen van een olympische medaille ik wil opnieuw een perfecte race roeien en dan zie ik me wel hoe ver ik daarmee geraak beter doen dan athene was mijn eerste bedoeling ik zie wel wat het zaterdag wordt
3701729 the new prime minister yousuf raza gilani who was in washington this week to meet president bush says he is doing his best to convince his country that this is pakistans war but he seems not to have won the argument within his own government
3701730 this complex situation calls for a careful and flexible response from the united states and to its credit the outgoing bush administration is making a relatively good start at fashioning that response
3701731 gillani on his first official us visit since being elected in february was left in no doubt that the bush administration had lost patience with the isis alleged double game
3701732 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3701733 the fact that we have young people over there who have u s passports is of tremendous concern because of their ability to come back into the united states
3701734 we have previously said that increased activity in the pakistani tribal areas gives us some reason for concern
3701735 we have also previously talked about our concerns that al qaida is seeking to recruit western looking sympathizers with no criminal records who could more easily blend in and attempt to travel to the united states
3701736 no credible information at this time to suggest an imminent threat to the homeland or u s interests at the olympics
3701737 i understand there is a problem of extremism at some madrassas
3701738 but to put everyone under this broad net of suspicion is beginning to infringe on peoples civil liberties
3701739 michael mccauls failed publicity stunt shows it is past time for new leadership in texas 10th congressional district
3701740 a nice sound bite that trivializes a very serious issue for this country
3701741 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3701742 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
3701743 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
3701744 and asked about leaked information that tipped militants to surveillance efforts by western intelligence services
3701745 thats probably something the government of pakistan ought to speak to
3701746 we and some of our allies have evidence not only from the scene of the explosion but evidence beyond it that unfortunately indicate a hand like that
3701747 we are fairly confident of what you are talking about
3701748 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3701749 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan
3701750 carrying what were seen as india influenced intelligence inputs had hardened the resolve of pakistans security establishment to keep supreme pakistans national security interest even if it meant straining ties with the us and nato
3701751 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
3701752 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
3701753 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006
3701754 the united states military has the capacity to direct a missile to a precise location at very short notice as it has done close to 20 times in the last few years to hit al qaeda targets inside pakistan
3701755 have long been intrigued by the presence of highly encrypted communications gear with mehsud this communication gear enables him to collect real time information on pakistani troop movements from an unidentified foreign source without being intercepted by pakistani intelligence
3701756 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3701757 there is a cold war between india and pakistan they say hands off kashmir we say hands off afghanistan
3701758 there is just enough pakistan co operation with the us to get away with it
3701759 but the us agenda is not innocent either they desire a larger role for themselves in the muslim world
3701760 the isi is going to determine the destiny of pakistan perhaps in the near future
3701761 during the afghan jihad so many things were created by pakistan now these elements are out of control
3701762 the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too
3701763 some rogue elements in the isi are working against the interest of the country they are being funded by a terror sponsor state the us
3701764 anytime the supreme court called the interior ministry or the defense ministry they could not get the isi into the court
3701765 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3701766 we have received information that nearly 800 militants are waiting to cross over to india at the borders
3701767 the wired fencing at border areas is being further strengthened
3701768 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3701769 mullah rahmatullah tried to show that the afghan government is weak in kandahar
3701770 after the arrest mullah rahmatullah confessed to his crimes and said he received orders and money for all terroristic activities and for the kidnappings from one of the members of pakistans consulate in kandahar
3701771 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3701772 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3701773 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
3701774 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
3701775 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
3701776 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
3701777 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3701778 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
3701779 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
3701780 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
3701781 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
3701782 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3701783 you are butchers liars and hypocrites you keep on talking about terrorism to the media but behind closed doors you support terrorism
3701784 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3701785 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
3701786 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
3701787 the united states is very keen that india become important
3701788 indias going to be doing what it wants to do in the area that china thinks is important and a more capable strong india will be able to prevent chinese hegemony more so than a weak india
3701789 we will learn how our allies operate in response to similar threats
3701790 it will allow us to build observations to eventually learn those lessons about what it takes to integrate talk fly with employ deploy and sustain air power with places like india korea and france
3701791 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
3701792 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities
3701793 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3701794 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
3701795 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
3701796 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
3701797 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
3701798 this is not true we have no reports of missiles being fired into pakistan
3701799 it is not clear whether wazir survived the attack or not but his brother abdur rehman and one of their close relatives abdul salam were killed in the strike
3701800 they were three men who suddenly stood up during the meeting and one of them opened fire on him
3701801 om nog enigszins kans te maken had het in het laatste game 5 4 moeten worden hij had enkele kansen daartoe
3701802 in tennis weet je nooit wat er dan nog had kunnen gebeuren maar gonzalez was gewoon te sterk hij verdient de zege olivier heeft nooit kunnen tonen dat hij op een gelijk niveau kon komen hij had nog pijn in de benen maar het was al beter dan gisteren al bij al is een derde ronde op de olympische spelen toch goed
3701803 today christian filmmakers can count on a very savvy pastoral community thats looking to highlight films like these to their congregations
3701804 theyve never made a movie about this guy and beyond any sort of spiritual reasons or anything like that he is really an iconic figure of the 20th century
3701805 ive been going to church and reading my bible and doing a lot of other spiritual work to get in that right headspace to even start to play someone like billy graham
3701806 we hope what weve done is pleasing to him franklin

3701811 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3701812 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3701813 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3701814 i didnt want to lose my job because i felt i had to take a stand
3701815 i felt i was no longer going to allow people to get away with bad behavior i was very nervous about my job situation

3701822 few colleges of the university have placement cells but the centralised cell will help students from nearly 60 colleges to have equal opportunity to get placed in companies of their choice
3701823 we will also organise workshops and shot term courses to inculcate communication personality development skills among the students so that they can get their dream job easily
3701824 big companies from various sectors like software pharmaceuticals finance humanities and life sciences are coming to the university in search of skilled employees they have already recruited several students from our leading colleges in recent years giving them high salaries
3701825 these companies are willing to offer good packages for eligible students last year students from some of the colleges got salary packages up to rs 18 lakh per annum
3701826 its important to note that these rates are subject to change at the discretion of iesi

3701831 many midcap stocks are looking quite interestingly placed and from business model point of view i think two three companies which i have mentioned earlier also one among them would be jmc projects india its a company with a better business model and they are moving into a good space with bot build operate and transfer related projects in the road sector as well as into the power transmission sector
3701832 the company is available at a very attractive valuation of 7 8 forward pe 40 50 growth coming in around two year of an order book visibility is there so this company looks pretty okay from the investment point of view if one wants to take a view for more than one year horizon because this market its largely going to favour the largecaps i think the midcaps are going to be wait and watch and get reward at some point of time in future so in such situation one will have to stay invested for longer period of time but the business model and the earnings of the companies are suggesting that one can buy this company at current market price

3701836 midcap technology may show some movement sectorally that is the trend i would see so i would look at stocks like mphasis rolta if i had to choose this one sector it is going to be that across the board you may see several stocks which i think are available at very good long term support points to name a few if we look some of them in the power sector if we look at some of them in the energy sector so i would look at these sectors and then take a bottom down approach so for now i would focus on midcap technology and that is why i see some action coming in
3701837 the country is deficient in scientific skills needed to meet the millennium development goals mdgs this is to say that there is something wrong with our system which is not in equilibrium with the prevailing technology
3701838 many of the phenomena such as the inability to utilise and sustain the natural and artificial resources are hyper chaotic and this is of great concern to physicists which necessitated our convergence today to address salient issues

3701906 we need to accept above all that we cannot guarantee to regenerate every town and every city in britain that has fallen behind just as we cant buck the market so we cant buck economic geography either places that enjoyed the conditions for creating wealth in the coal powered 19th century often do not do so today port cities had an advantage in an era when exporting manufactured goods by sea was a vital source of prosperity today the sea is a barrier to their potential for expansion and they are cut off from the main road transport routes more generally the economic pull of europe has boosted the south east at the expense of the north wales and scotland luck has also played its part in 1900 london had finance and manchester had cotton finance has since prospered and cotton collapsed reinforcing geographical changes there is no realistic prospect that our regeneration towns and cities can converge with london and the south east there is however a very real prospect of encouraging significant numbers of people to move from those towns to london and the south east we know that the capital and its region are economic powerhouses that can grow and create new high skilled high wage service sector hubs at the same time market mechanisms can be used to induce some firms to move out of the south east
3701907 we know that the south east offers the greatest agglomeration potential so it makes sense to think seriously about having more than one large city in the south east where london has dominated for so long we also know that cities based on highly skilled workers are the most dynamic oxford and cambridge are unambiguously britains leading research universities outside london and both are well located economically we should consider expanding both dramatically just as liverpool and manchester expanded in the 19th century dynamic economies require dynamic economic geography of course there are successful high tech clusters outside the south east and it is right that they should build on their strengths but in many cases that does not imply huge expansion manchester leeds and newcastle for example all have decided strengths but they are not successful enough to deliver prosperity to neighbouring towns such as rochdale bradford and sunderland in the way that london is able to support relatively poor communities in north kent and south essex

3701914 and theres more to come we also expect block 4 to start producing in 2008 and in a few years block 31 will come on stream
3701915 it is well known of course that both beauty and celebrity endorsements are used by marketers to sell products
3701916 celebrities are chosen to advertise specific products because of what we call their esp or emotional selling proposition however given that most celebrities are also considered to be attractive it is not known to what extent celebrity and beauty interact to drive consumer decision making
3701917 psychophysiological data were recorded from both of the subjects hands while being shown these test advertisements
3701918 the aim was to measure the electroconductivity of a form of fine sweating that is automatically generated during emotive responses on our hands a technique which is also known as the electrodermal response
3701919 although it was a relatively small scale study and there is certainly potential for further research the results we obtained suggest that it doesnt matter how attractive the celebrity is or isnt because the test subjects still exhibited a greater emotional response when looking at a celebrity than a non celebrity
3701920 the relationship wasnt working out for either of them but all that stuff that happened with shia definitely didnt help things

3701926 although the traditionally expensive cities of western europe and asia still feature in the top 20 cities in eastern europe brazil and india are creeping up the list conversely some locations such as stockholm and new york now appear less costly by comparison our research confirms the global trend in price increases for certain foodstuffs and petrol though the rise is not consistent in all locations this is partly balanced by decreasing prices for certain commodities such as electronic and electrical goods we attribute this to cheaper imports from developing countries especially china and to advances in technology

3701946 hey remember those flight sims we used to play when we were teenagers wouldnt it be cool if someone made a game like them and just stripped out all of that complex crap that took 5 hours to learn but didnt really do anything
3701947 banning directional drilling was bad energy policy then and its bad energy policy now
3701948 there is little to no risk of contamination to the great lakes bottom or waters from directionally drilled wells
3701949 the economic benefit of tapping michigans great lakes reserves would be 3 billion to 4 billion
3701950 drilling would not get us out of the mess of high oil prices
3701951 were looking at a lid on price increases in our area
3701952 he didnt go to tibet and meet cool people but it was very similar in vibe
3701953 in my version there was actually a new villain it wasnt one of the classics which is probably why they didnt use it it was more of a hannibal lecter type he was somebody already in arkham asylum that bruce went and sort of studied with
3701954 it was a whole thing i get very emotional about it i still love the story maybe ill get to do it as a comic one day
3701955 it is mentioned earlier that there is no such thing as a typical rape or rape victim likewise there is no such thing as a typical pattern or responses to rape
3701956 a large number of obviously endangered children are still not reported to the authorities according to the national incidence study in 1986 professionals still failed to report half the maltreated children whom they saw
3701957 im simply suggesting that there are advantages to presenting research findings in terms that make the results seem as impressive as possible a report depicting a big problem will be favored in the competition to gain attention
3701958 in healthcare industry there are compelling reasons to collect and analyze data for example statistics kept on activities in the healthcare facility indicate why patients come to the facility and the cost of taking care of them patient care statistics and studies on performance can show the quality of care provided many accrediting agencies require data analysis system as part of accreditation and many third party payers require facilities to collect performance data
3701959 descriptive statistics describe what the data show for example we may need to know the average age of our patients or which service is used the most in our facility inferential statistics on the other hand help to make inferences or draw conclusions from a small group of data to a larger group the smaller group is often called a sample which is a portion of the larger group or population the results obtained from the sample are assumed to be typical of the entire population
3701960 statistics is the science of collection organizing summering analyzing and making inferences from data descriptive statistics includes collection organizing summarizing and presenting data inferential statistics includes making inferences hypothesis testing determining relationships and making predictions
3701961 a psychotherapist colleague of mine remarks that he alternates as in a tennis game between seeing the patient as object when he thinks of patterns dynamics reality testing and other aspects of general principles to which the patients behavior refers and as subject when he empathizes with the patients suffering and sees the world through the patients eyes
3701962 sartre does all of this on the basis of his existential understanding of man and his unshakable conviction that the human being simply cannot be understood at all if we see him only what our study of subhuman forms of life determinisms or fragmentize him into separate instincts or sets of stimuli and response or in any way take away from the man we try to study his ultimate freedom and individual responsibility
3701963 it was mentioned earlier that there is no such thing as a typical rape or rape victim
3701964 the law supported and largely written by industry backed groups requires the government for the first time to set standards for the quality of scientific information and statistics used and disseminated by federal agencies
3701965 its important to look at any study skeptically even studies from the most prestigious medical schools have been found to be faulty in design the conclusions drawn by the researchers may be found to be incorrect and in rare circumstances data stats has been falsified or altered so the results supported what the researchers are trying to prove
3701966 it has posed a problem for us in the past beating one of the top two or three teams
3701967 we think we are at the level where we can compete
3701968 this is what we have spent the last four or five years trying to like we have won the last four leinsters and the problem has been making that step up afterwards
3701969 we have invested a lot of time and energy and talking about how to make that step time will tell if we can
3701970 if we do get to an all ireland final or please god win an all ireland it will be one of the most hard won all irelands because it is coming five or six years now there is an awful lot of work gone into it
3701971 guys realise that now they know the level we are at they know the amount of preparation that has been put in hopefully all that work wont go unrewarded i think we probably are in a better place than last year we have done a hell of a lot of work no stone has gone unturned
3701972 we are in a confident state of mind at the moment guys are obviously when you produce a good performance it breeds confidence
3701973 we have taken a few hard knocks over the last couple of years including against tyrone three years ago
3701974 there were so many ups and downs in the two games it was a real rollercoaster
3701975 unfortunately we have had so many of them games over the years i tend to get mixed up to be honest i dont remember much about the first game
3701976 i dont now if i would call it a more physical approach but we knew we needed to spend a bit more time in the gym
3701977 from tyrone and armagh everyone else learned a lesson that if they are to step up to the plate they have to get a bit more physical body strength wise they had to improve
3701978 again tyrone and armagh set the benchmark for that and it is no secret that we have invested a lot of time in gyms over the last couple of years it has been a big part of our training
3701979 if you perform poorly against westmeath in the semi final people were going to write us off
3701980 then we had a good performance against wexford and people are saying we are going to win the all ireland championship
3701981 it will be a huge occasion for the fans and it will be a huge occasion for croke park it is the type of game that could really really set fire to the championship
3701982 it is a problem to enroll hiv positive people because they either dont disclose or come forward it is only through the help of organisations like knp it can be done
3701983 our symbol o is about much more than barack obama
3701984 barack obama is a very exciting catalyst at first we were bothered by the negative and vulgar comments made when someone attacks something you hold dear it hurts but as we continued to read all the comments we realized just how silly and frankly unimaginative most of them were many didnt even take the time to read the article people came out against the peace emblem in the sixties making accusations that it was an anti christian symbol an inverted crucifix a satanic symbol and a communist sign but like our o the goodness inherent in the peace symbol persevered and today it is the international symbol for peace the hand sign for peace was first a british form of giving someone the bird then it became a war cry for victory today it is a symbol of peace amp love once again goodness persevered we too will persevere bring your hands together over your head to make a large o and join us in our fight to take america back vote for barack obama

3702003 the vetting that goes on by angel flight i know they do their best to find the safest combination of pilots and airplanes but since they are not a commercial carrier there is a level there that they simply cant arise to
3702004 the entire angel flight world is saddened and surprised and shocked that this is happening all at once
3702005 is there any commonality its just so strange to have this happen after such a long history
3702006 when we did the first climate change computer models we thought the arctics summer ice cover would last until around 2070
3702007 it is now clear we did not understand how thin the ice cap had already become for arctic ice cover has since been disappearing at ever increasing rates every few years we have to revise our estimates downwards now the most detailed computer models suggest the arctics summer ice is going to last for only a few more years and given what we have seen happen last week i think they are probably correct
3702008 it does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for arctic ice maslowski said the crucial point is that ice is clearly not building up enough over winter to restore cover and that when you combine current estimates of ice thickness with the extent of the ice cap you get a very clear indication that the arctic is going to be ice free in summer in five years and when that happens there will be consequences
3702009 the trouble is that sea ice is now disappearing from the arctic faster than our ability to develop new computer models and to understand what is happening there we always knew it would be the first region on earth to feel the impact of climate change but not at anything like this speed what is happening now indicates that global warming is occurring far earlier than any of us expected
3702010 i know many friends who change from hindu to muslim you know any

3702231 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

3702249 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3702250 it might startle some americans to realize that iran has one of the most pro american populations in the middle east
3702251 this proves once again the chinese womens team is the best and most excellent
3702252 i was also surprised at the mistakes made by the u s team
3702253 before they go out there i want them to believe in themselves and they all did
3702254 i didnt have to say anything to them even though they are very young they have a lot of experience as well and they have their own ways to learn from their own experiences and they used those ways
3702255 as for the gymnastics this gold medal can attract more children to the gymnasiums in china
3702256 with todays performance of the team we really showed this is a sport full of vitality expectations and hope
3702257 in china well have more people coming into gymnasiums and we will be stronger in the future

3702259 wenn jemand stada bernehmen m chte dann soll er ein angebot vorlegen

3702263 wir werden alle 64 substanzen pr fen und schlie en nicht aus dass wir uns um alle 64 bewerben werden
3702264 aber vor einer solchen situation sehen wir die deutsche volkswirtschaft derzeit nicht
3702265 wir haben keine rezession und sollten die konsolidierung weiter betreiben
3702266 in der jetzigen situation halte ich ein konjunkturprogramm f r nicht sinnvoll
3702267 eigentlich keine konjunkturprogramme sondern andere politische ma nahmen die man verfolgt und von denen man sich jetzt verspricht sie leichter durchsetzen zu k nnen dass man ihnen auch noch das m ntelchen der konjunkturstimulierung umwirft
3702268 bevor die zielmarke wieder in greifbare n he kommt ist sicherlich hinsichtlich der ezb keine politik nderung angesagt

3702271 ich h tte gro e bedenken wie man unter den deutschen gesetzlichen rahmenbedingungen berhaupt ein programm schneidern kann dass der konjunktur hilft
3702272 politiker k nnten sich sagen wenn wir das ohnehin auf der agenda haben machen wir es doch jetzt um einen konjunkturellen nebeneffekt zu haben
3702273 mit einem solchen steuerscheck w rde man relativ kurzfristig das gew nschte ziel erreichen

3702275 de vov verleent vrijwel dezelfde diensten als de anbo iedereen kan daar prima terecht het is de meeste ouderen om het even van welke vereniging ze lid zijn als de service maar goed is
3702276 toen de anbo anderhalf jaar geleden aangaf zich te wilde aansluiten bij de vakbond de fnv is het begonnen
3702277 dat kunnen ze nu wel zeggen maar drie jaar geleden is het toenmalige hoofdbestuur afgetreden na financieel wanbeleid
3702278 de anbo eiste van het voorschotense bestuur dat de vov zou ophouden te bestaan
3702279 dat gewest zit verschrikkelijk met de kwestie in zijn maag het bestuur van zuid holland heeft de opdracht een nieuw bestuur te formeren in voorschoten maar bestuursleden vinden in voorschoten is een vrijwel onmogelijke opgave de anbo voorschoten is zonder bestuur simpelweg vleugellam

3702289 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

3702291 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3702299 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

3702303 truth is always the first war causality the emotional disturbances and distortions in historical writing are greatest in wartime
3702304 revisionism meant nothing more or less than the effort to correct the historical record in the light of a more complete collection of historical facts a more calm political atmosphere and a more objective attitude
3702305 the efforts of establishment historians to remain on the good side of the powers that be like the court historians who served kings and emperors of old thus created a historical record that often resembled the products of their wartimepropaganda more than honest independent scholarship when history is written by partisan historians from a victor nation the winning side emerges simplistically as the

3702454 i dont think united have another level to go to
3702455 they had a lot of players at the peak of their form for the last two years
3702456 rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again
3702457 wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs at his age theyve all been fantastic
3702458 i think we can close the gap because man united were at the very top of their game last season
3702459 but weve been very close to them and we had injuries and a change of manager
3702460 the new manager has come in and made a few changes hes made some great signings deco looks awesome so im excited to see him play
3702461 we need to start well and get off to a flyer just keep winning
3702462 man united have a few tough games early on liverpool have made some good signings and will be stronger this year we need to focus
3702463 we have a good home record and if we can continue that and get off to a good start well be all right

3702469 the soul only knows for certain that it is hungry
3702470 the danger is not lest the soul should doubt whether there is any bread
3702471 which meant that they failed to recognise for approximately five months that certain of the scgs asset backed positions were wrongly valued
3702472 the penalty reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence
3702473 the sudden and unexpected announcement of the writedown had the potential to undermine market confidence
3702474 this identified serious failures in the subsidiaries controls over the scg and the operation and management of those controls and concluded that they were not effective

3702477 a no and b it would be okay if you are as long as you c still have grandbabies for me she knows the last is a joke
3702478 daddy is saying that he doesnt like it when men hurt women
3702479 yes most girls do marry boys but girls can marry girls and boys can marry boys youll get to decide that when you grow up too
3702480 i would rather my kids know it is something i chose than something that has to be or that is the
3702481 i guess id rather my kids know that im kinky than to think im june cleaver

3702485 i think the most important thing is what the prospects are beyond 2008 looking into 2009
3702486 some people resort to using instructors who are not registered who havent got their instructors certificates and as a result these people are paying exorbitant fees for a teacher who is not registered to teach
3702487 the kids wont get up and my head is killing me and christopher wont wear what i got out for him and he didnt want cereal he wanted eggs amp spinach thanks grandma and ava refuses to get in the car unless she can bring every toy she has ever owned and blah blah blah and now im going back to bed
3702488 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby
3702489 and now the baby was having a baby i was shocked a little bit it was mind boggling
3702490 im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3702491 at this point the investigation is so early on that im reluctant to put out information that could be premature and impact on any enforcement or any investigation activities that we may carry out
3702492 clearly the three year inspection standard that theyve established is woefully inadequate and has placed everyone in this province at risk
3702493 from my perspective its not adequate to inspect a facility like this every three years
3702494 suppose the operator doesnt operate to the highest standards how are you going to find that out
3702495 what i really want to know right now is how many of these facilities are in populated areas or near schools and we also want to know what the status of the inspections of these facilities are
3702496 those who support the tradition say parents were free to decide whether they want to send their daughter to serve as kumari or not the girl gets state allowances and is looked after well
3702497 astrologers were consulting horoscopes of candidates from buddhist shakya families to replace the current kumari preeti shakya who is 11 and should retire during the annual hindu festival of dasain in october temple officials said
3702498 if we dont change her now well have to wait until next year which could be late
3702499 if the girl starts menstruating while serving as kumari it is considered inauspicious
3702500 im excited to meet with sen levins staff to share my knowledge and understanding of the credit industry
3702501 for years i worked on the collection side of the industry and i saw the numerous mistakes that each of the three credit bureaus regularly make thats why i was inspired to start cjs

3702512 now the fundamental laws of history as all men know and concede are veracity and honesty but history calls for style and composition it is not enough to record the events they must be interpreted and judged with movement and eloquence in keeping the orator will supply what is needed
3702513 the shadowy hope of a shadowy existence did not convince the traditional roman of the governing order the sole and solid propect of survival lay in good deeds with good repute thereafter to posterity hence the preoccupation with fame sharp insistent and dominant even philosophers who impugned the validity of the opinion could not deny or repel the tempations of glory

3702532 we are of course not immune to the challenging environment around us and the sustained weakness across financial markets put pressure on earnings
3702533 combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline
3702534 the good news was that the company reduced its equity exposure again proved resiliant in the credit crisis and the balance sheet remained strong
3702535 a number of factors inimical to growth have intensified in 2008
3702536 expected losses from u s sub prime exposures have by now been mostly acknowledged it is too early to assess whether the worst of the turmoil and loss of asset values is behind us
3702537 there may be further setbacks in the months to come but broadly financial conditions are not likely to stabilize before early 2009

3702555 so you have flown to other systems before and it has all gone smoothly
3702556 of course its going to be okay where going to get to go together on the floris its a great ship i was looking at its design two warp engines eight chunnel thrusters it can warp at almost five times light speed
3702557 it just seems so scary to hurtle all the way across space like that
3702558 perhaps if you know how it works a little more itll make you feel safer
3702559 well the important thing to understand is that inter system ships have warp drives
3702560 a ship in warp can only go straight in a direct line between two points turning or maneuvering in any way would be very dangerous it would be too difficult to maneuver at such high speeds
3702561 it generally takes several hours for a ship to reach its maximum speed and then several hours to slow from maximum speed to a halt
3702562 of course warp paths are generally planned far in advance space is fast and its unlikely two warp paths would cross but just in case the federation maintains a central warp path database
3702563 so we will get on the space elevator go to the launch point board the ship then itll warp us straight tothe darfon system
3702564 well not quite there is no clear path from here to the darfon system it goes too close to the center of the galaxy
3702565 yes we will do three warp jumps we have to make a stop at waypoints along the way it takes hours to slow down from the warp and then the warp drivers have to warm up before jumping again
3702566 and this is all planned in detail ahead of time
3702567 yes exactly also the only time the ship is vulnerable to attack by a foreign power is between jumps
3702568 dont worry that only happens during wartime or perhaps when travelling in fringe territory near a hostile power still we keep the waypoints secret so that no one would even know where to wait for the ship so they could attack it
3702569 well its a secret i shouldnt really be telling you
3702570 awww come on jeremy you know you can tell me
3702571 the first stop my little vixen will be in deep space near the ered system a dead binary star system then there will be a waypoint near the sephar system
3702572 goh wat zie je er goed uit eerder heb ik dit nooit gehoord wat heb je gedaan hoe doe je dat
3702573 ons lichaam is als een tuin die we met onze wil verzorgen
3702574 i think is significant that the european union should be able to address its relations with russia at its gymnich eu foreign ministers meeting in september and through decisions about whether or not and how to proceed with the partnership and cooperation agreement
3702575 the aggressive russian force beyond south ossetian borders has been something that really shocked many people
3702576 all of the european foreign ministers ive spoken to will have been shocked by the scenes that theyve seen from georgia over the last few days
3702577 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
3702578 im sure we will have a very tough discussion about eu russia relations in the future
3702579 the blame game and the tough talk will start at a later stage
3702580 i do not think we should get lost today in long discussions about responsibility or who caused the escalation of the last few days
3702581 its important to say the russians have talked about war crimes thats a very serious issue
3702582 there has been tit for tat between south ossetia and georgia if theres any evidence of war crimes then the russians must produce it because theyre using the argument to justify what theyve done
3702583 and weve got to say very clearly if theres war crimes of course we take that very very seriously indeed
3702584 i think at the moment people are talking more about the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce
3702585 i think it would be quite wrong to rule that out i think the un is going to have an important role to play and the osce
3702586 there needs to an internationalisation of this settlement process and then there needs to be proper engagement on the ground to make sure that the rights of georgia and others are not flouted
3702587 its going to be great youll get this job and then well be on darfon ii together i really thought it sucked when my corps got assigned there but now that you can get a job there too itll work out
3702588 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3702589 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3702590 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3702591 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3702592 there is nobody in our sport that can win like he wins
3702593 he is not just winning he is crunching world records
3702594 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3702595 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3702596 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3702597 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3702598 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3702599 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well

3702621 hit by the combined impact of failed harvests and global increases in the price of food
3702622 with millions facing hunger and destitution the region is now reaching a tipping point with increasing numbers of people unable to cope
3702623 altogether five countries ethiopia kenya somalia eritrea and djibouti are affected the situation could easily become catastrophic
3702624 women and children are suffering most from malnutrition and many are now only surviving because of supplementary food rations
3702625 we will raise this matter with the highest possible authority and fight for our stolen victory
3702626 in my understanding eck was to carry out a complete re tallying of the process and declare the winner thereafter instead ms wamiru announced who in her opinion was the winner
3702627 im convinced at the end of the day we will find an international peacekeeping force
3702628 either on the side of the civilian crisis management or the side of military crisis management and peacekeeping
3702629 we have a ceasefire we do not yet have peace
3702630 what is probably going to happen is a few skirmishes and a few bombs here and there
3702631 persuade our russian colleagues and partners to change formulas of peacekeeping
3702632 tsvangirai is moving goal posts forcing us to negotiate issues which we had already agreed upon
3702633 when mbeki came here everyone thought that he had a deal in the bag and just wanted the principals to endorse what their negotiators had agreed
3702634 but it is now case of so near yet so far for the negotiator and he now faces the real prospect of going to the summit empty handed
3702635 i am not going to take the country and hand it over to somebody who cannot handle the situation or who is not loved by the people
3702636 while we are trying to extinguish the fire here with our troops we dont understand why they chose this moment to put more oil on fire
3702637 we hope to add the boys soccer title to the lot
3702638 they are our hope especially after denying kyulu and matuu
3702639 some of our players turn out for clubs in nairobi during the holidays it is an individual competition but there are prospects
3702640 by conservative standards we should win both soccer titles and volleyball because the teams are well prepared we had stiff competition at the province with up to 16 teams for each discipline which is far less than the eight at the national level
3702641 they lost to a much stronger team thur gem who are better prepared
3702642 we have not performed well in badminton and table tennis but can improve on the positions
3702643 remember north eastern held st anthonys the then defending champions when nairobi hosted the championships
3702644 i cannot begin to understand why anyone would want to build an eyesore like this in their back garden
3702645 it is not in keeping with the properties in this area its like building an asda supermarket in the middle of a beauty spot

3702819 but it was a great experience training with the lads and being a part of the squad that was a great help to me you hope that if hes trapattoni bringing you on for the last few minutes that hell think about you when hes picking the next squad
3702820 trapattoni is a great character hes very enthusiastic for a man in his 60s and has a great love for the game and im hoping to play a lot more under him i just have to keep playing well for norwich week in week out and make sure that if i get a chance i take it
3702821 i was impressed when they brought me to see the training facilities and i heard their plans for the season ahead the gaffer swung it for me though when he told me how they play good football and how theyve already sold 25 000 season tickets and have an amazing fanbase
3702822 i think players have agendas certain players come over all the time no matter what
3702823 maybe they want to get 50 or 100 caps and a pat on the back for it
3702824 i think shays one of those ones he wants to get 200 caps

3702834 well i take a few things into consideration when making my choice
3702835 i usually choose the medium sized ones and look at the stem end to determine when it was harvested if it was cut from the vine and has a long green stem that means it was harvested early so it is not vine ripened if the stem has dried up and fallen off or is loose enough to gently pull away from the melon than its probably ripe i look for the ones that have a clean divot like that one see where the stem used to be then i press on the divot to see if it yields a bit to the pressure which is a good sign oh and when most melons are fragrant theyre ripe

3702856 unless demand slows down in places like china india and brazil the oil we save will be offset by increased demand elsewhere and that will keep pressure up on prices
3702857 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3702858 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3702859 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3702860 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3702861 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress

3703090 todas estas localidades cuenten con planes de emergencia propios con el fin de que se lleven a cabo los protocolos de actuaci n necesarios para minimizar los efectos de cualquier situaci n extraordinaria
3703091 son necesarios para desarrollar un plan de emergencia concreto para un municipio
3703092 es un mal dato por cuanto deja la inflaci n interanual en el 5 2 en la comunitat y en un 5 3 en espa a cifras que no se conoc an desde 1992
3703093 no tienen nada que ver con el incremento de los salarios que se ha demostrado positivo debido a la forma en que se determinan y a la cl usula de revisi n salarial que la mayor a de convenios estipula
3703094 las llamadas a la moderaci n no deben de realizarse sobre el incremento de los salarios sino a los m rgenes comerciales
3703095 pese a lo reiterado desde alg n foro las cl usulas de revisi n salarial son m s necesarias si cabe en la actual coyuntura por cuanto no elevan la inflaci n y al actuar tras producirse los aumentos reparan a posteriori las posibles p rdidas de poder adquisitivo de los trabajadores y trabajadoras por el descontrol de la inflaci n real sobre la prevista por lo distintos gobiernos

3703101 aunque el ipc baj unas d cimas durante el mes de julio este descenso no puede considerarse como un dato positivo ya que siempre se producen bajadas durante este periodo debido al efecto rebajas y este a o el descenso ha sido mucho menor que el registrado en a os anteriores
3703102 tener en cuenta que la demanda de los consumidores tambi n ha descendido debido a la crisis econ mica y eso deber a haber amplificado el efecto positivo en el ipc pero no ha sido as lo que revela nuevamente que existen unas tendencias inflacionistas que el ejecutivo socialista no sabe controlar
3703103 otra cifra bastante m s realista en esta ocasi n es la tasa interanual del ipc que este mes ha escalado hasta el 5 3 su valor m s alto en casi 16 a os esto nos da una idea muy clara de lo lejos que queda todav a el repunte econ mico
3703104 la gesti n econ mica socialista es una especie de broma de mal gusto para todos los espa oles ya que si miramos los n meros y realizamos alguna que otra comparaci n al ejecutivo de zapatero se le deber a caer la cara de verg enza

3703140 since the growth of breast cancer is dependent on vegfr 2 activation imc 1121b presents a unique opportunity to optimize this therapeutic approach as imc 1121b uniquely binds to the vegfr 2 receptor itself thereby blocking many vegf ligands from activating it
3703141 unlike bevacizumab that targets only a single ligand and unlike small molecule drugs that target many unrelated receptors imc 1121b specifically targets only vegfr 2 this clinical trial will help us understand whether this approach produces greater activity with fewer side effects
3703142 this trial of imc 1121b highlights the efforts of trio to bring promising new therapies to women with breast cancer which remains the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women today

3703229 these are fine design decisions for a jit but hopeless for an interpreter both interpreting the 6 bytes of bytecode in two smallintegers and skipping over the named instance variables on each literal access would slow an interpreter down significantly
3703230 so pressing was the increase in footprint in vw that the up to 6 bytecodes in 2 smallintegers scheme was concocted now thats a complicated scheme

3703232 2008 06 23 p p s as joshua gargus one of my colleagues at qwaq astutely pointed out today one also needs to deal with the changes to the pc in existing contexts when one shape changes compiled methods so one would need to enumerate all context objects to fix up their pcs and this gets tricky since those contexts could be in use by the classbuilder so some care is required to pull this off thanks josh

3703234 i think this is a problem of not seeing the wood for the trees the problem is not the format of compiledmethod it is not being able to change it or subclass it
3703235 one important one is that of contexts contexts are a superb abstraction for activations easing the implementation of processes the debugger and so on but they suck as a form for real execution
3703236 so contexts belong in the image and clever tricks to do without contexts most of the time belong in the vm but that implies that any code to do with hiding contexts belongs in the vm which implies that the lower levels of the code generator are in the vm

3703251 the aa has conducted numerous research projects into the effects of alcohol on driving and without exception each one has proven that drivers are already significantly impaired at the 0 05 percent limit
3703252 we are concerned that this limit is inappropriate in south africa where one is 14 times more likely to die in a traffic crash than in the usa
3703253 the aa fully agrees with the 0 02 percent limit for professional drivers
3703254 this allows some leeway for medications which contain alcohol but still emphasises that one alcoholic drink puts you over the limit the mixed message of having a different limit for ordinary drivers is impeding the fight against drunkenness on our roads
3703255 the more risk factors we can eliminate from the roads the safer theyll become

3703257 a very small number of babies have been identified as carrying esbl and are being treated in accordance with infection control guidelines
3703258 whilst this is not posing an immediate problem to the health of the babies and the unit remains open to new admissions we are treating the situation seriously as this strain can be resistant to several antibiotics that are commonly used
3703259 the esbl organism can live harmlessly in the gut of many people and tends to affect those who have recently been in hospital or those that have received antibiotic treatment
3703260 advice is being sought from health professionals at the health protection agency and we will work closely with the families of the babies to ensure they are kept up to date with the situation

3703457 on the eve of the decision by the sa reserve banks monetary policy committee with regard to interest rate adjustments the trade union still contends that other options should be considered to bring inflation under control
3703458 further interest rate hikes will only be detrimental to the economy and could lead to a situation of stagflation
3703459 stagflation usually follows in instances where a certain crisis such as the power crisis in south africa leads to increased prices which could give rise to less profitable production levels
3703460 it is vested in the idea that inflation is increased by an increased amount of money in circulation which influences the ability of the economy to make sufficient provision
3703461 the consumer is footing the bill production has also decreased while the producers because of the higher sales prices of items make sufficient profit even if fewer items are produced
3703462 if supply surpasses demand prices will decrease south africa should now focus on expanding infrastructure and assist its people to be more productive

3703470 when i saw the archway and the view of the rockies i knew golden was the right place
3703471 al jazeera is always going to evoke some raised eyebrows from folks who arent real familiar with their work since it isnt seen here
3703472 al jazeera is a legitimate news organization and we want those 120 million viewers to see that regular folks in the united states are great people and we have a lot of diversity in our population and our views

3703522 seguir el legado de juan bustos es nuestra responsabilidad hist rica
3703523 sin duda constituye un honor y una responsabilidad muy grande en primer termino por la importancia que significa encabezar una institucion de tanta jerarqu a como la c mara de diputados y en segundo lugar por la inmensa responsabilidad que implica suceder a un gran hombre como juan bustos
3703524 ac se resolvi en una votaci n democr tica la opci n de sergio aguilo representaba a una visi n y la m a a otra esto es parte de los mecanismos internos que nos damos dentro de la bancada simplemente algunos diputados se inclinaron por una opci n y otros lo hicieron por otra pero lo importante hoy es ser capaces de permanecer unidos entendiendo que el legado de juan bustos nos llama a actuar con mesura y responsabilidad en pol tica
3703525 bajo los principios rectores por los cuales he guiado mi vida desde la juventud ac estamos para construir nos debemos a la gente es nuestra labor el ser capaces de enaltecer la funci n publica y reivindicar a la pol tica como el instrumento de cambio y confrontaci n de ideas en la sociedad

3703538 this world championships has been such an amazing experience for me the whole team has stayed positive and we went out there ready to deliver the routines we have been working for over the last eight weeks we were not expecting to make team finals on top of qualifying for the olympics so achieving this was soooooo fantastic we couldnt stop smiling for hours competing in team finals was awesome just knowing that we were the first gb gymnasts to ever experience this competition and being up against some of the worlds best teams was really great i would like to say a big thank you from me and the rest of the team to all the national and personal coaches for helping us to achieve this unforgettable result and to our parents and friends for all of their wonderful support yippeeeeeeee

3703542 aside from the general ridiculousness of casting aspersions on the american ness of hawaii ms roberts criticism smacks of the worst prejudices faced by asian americans im sure if he had decided to go to the exclusive golfing resort of myrtle beach instead the press would have dutifully reported how american his vacation was and how regular americans could identify with such a lavish trip
3703543 i would love to take ms roberts on a tour of oahu with stops at the arizona memorial and punchbowl followed by a visit with hawaii army national guard soldiers training for their second deployment to the middle east
3703544 then i would take her to eastside grill to watch team usa womens volleyball and bryan clay i would introduce her to hawaii residents so she could witness our diversity and learn about the aloha spirit part of what makes america great is the unique contributions of all 50 states sen obama has every right to come home and visit his sister and grandmother

3703547 id received very positive feedback from organisers of the mwa and being a previous winner was advised i was hot favourite to win for a second year running
3703548 however when i asked the judges for feedback on my novel they told me that it had not been included in the submissions they were asked to judge it was only then that i realised my work was being censored by the muslims writers awards project
3703549 im angry at the treatment ive received because my creative effort is being treated as if its somehow unclean and unworthy clearly the muslim writers awards has decided that the novel is so unpalatable for them that it needs to be buried
3703550 im deeply dismayed that a project like this which is supposed to unearth new talent and celebrate artistic expression has been hijacked by the puritan mindset
3703551 yes its true that not all the muslim characters in my book are model citizens however this is just a reflection of the realities we face today
3703552 its unseemly that my novel is being treated as if its the second coming of the satanic verses i have created a work of fiction which is neither blasphemous nor disrespectful towards any particular group or individual
3703553 dr maliks submission was certainly one of the best we received in 2008 and was rightly short listed along with four other unpublished novelists
3703554 following investigation it is clear that his work was not submitted to the judges as it should have been
3703555 the muslim writers awards project does not condone censorship as we do not believe in stifling individuals right to artistic self expression
3703556 we are very disappointed at the news that five of the citys 63 post offices are to close post offices are vital and underpin our neighbourhood centres
3703557 they provide an essential service to our communities local businesses and local economy and we recognise that these closures will cause considerable disruption however we are considering a number of options to help support a sustainable post office network
3703558 we are in discussions with the local government assocation who are themselves in talks with ministers and we are also following developments in essex closely where negotiations between the council and post office limited about retaining post offices are most advanced

3703601 but waxman must now run a business manage employees on both coasts and deal with the day to day stuff that dogs new ceos

3703609 i dont know where these cars are coming from but they are being driven to death and then burned out in bilboa
3703610 i noticed that in the last few weeks stones have been put down to try to stop people getting in but something more concrete is needed because this cant continue
3703611 nothing has been done in rossmore there are no cameras no barriers and nobody seems to be doing anything
3703612 we had 18 scouts three venture scouts three leaders and two leaders on staff and at around 4pm on saturday it started to spill rain
3703613 up to that point the carlow camp had been lucky because our site had managed to avoid being flooded but others had been badly affected during the week but within half an hour all of our tents were flooded and we were standing in two or three inches of water
3703614 he thankfully managed to get a bus to us and we were able to load people into it and get most of them home
3703615 id say about 3 500 thousand people stayed on and we slept in the event centre in punchestown we had to clean things up and we wanted to dry the tents but by sunday we were told we had to abandon the place completely so parents came with trailers to pick up the tents and everything that was left
3703616 he was a very good man to work for and very loyal if you did him a favour hed always do something back
3703617 isnt it great that the keebler elf just happens to be related to the owner of a blue stone quarry
3703618 we are not the only ones who do this and we are very careful to only go on lands where we have permission
3703619 we are shooting pigeons and crows nothing else we are helping the farmers and if farmers dont want it thats fine
3703620 i dont agree with people shooting for fun but the point is they shouldnt have been on our land
3703621 they didnt have permission and what if something happens is the landowner liable
3703622 it is up to the promoter to provide the tourist with the information as to where he is and where he is entitled to shoot
3703623 in order to shoot the tourist has to have a firearm licence and a game licence as issued from an garda s och na which they can not secure unless they can show a proof of entitlement for such a licence
3703624 the problem arises in how that is interpreted the national park and wildlife service believe it is unlawful to shoot pigeons in stumble fields even if the grain is located just over the ditch from this stumbled field
3703625 it felt great to be involved in something like this
3703626 it was just something i was interested in and i picked it up fairly well and it has escalated from there im fairly hooked on it now

3703632 weve redesigned the whole stage and were bringing in loads of props that wont be on stage but around the venue
3703633 weve written a lot of new songs but weve bottled out of playing them live because from past experience weve ended up hating some of our favourites by the time we recorded them
3703634 if theyve given you dodgy goldfish then theyre going to die
3703635 women kind of wilt as men sort of achieve as they get older like wine or whatever its like oh shes past her prime and she cant play a sex symbol
3703636 its just a preconceived notion about women in general and particularly in this industry its a very vain vain industry
3703637 if i had enough in common with a player then i would have no problem going out with one of them lots of people meet their boyfriends through work

3703644 am horizont zeichnet sich bereits ab dass die informationslawine allm hlich geb ndigt und strukturiert werden wird zu sinnvollen verl sslichen und auf die person ma geschneiderte wissenseinheiten das wird geschehen ber die st rkere verwendung von metadaten von intelligenten agenten von vertikalen suchmaschinen wo fachleute informationen gefiltert und kombiniert haben von gigaportalen f r die verschiedensten anwendungsbereiche von aktiven dokumenten die von sich aus antworten geben k nnen

3703648 i fail to understand why the government is dithering on issuing clear guidelines to allay the apprehensions of broadcasters the broadcasters today apprehend that in view of the existing guidelines if they provide signals or content to the hits platform they will be violating the existing guidelines because the existing guidelines permit supply of signals or content only to registered msos and cable operators and to the dth platform it is high time that the government immediately takes a decision on this aspect in consumer interest we all talk of consumer interest and say that consumer interest comes first but this has remained a mere slogan in reality nobody appears to be bothered about consumer interest
3703649 though the broadcast tribunal had dismissed our petition at the same time it has criticised the government for not clearing the hits policy we would now send the copy of the judgment to the ministry of information and broadcasting so that the matter could be resolved as soon as possible because in the hits case the policy is the only major issue and once this gets sorted i am sure we will witness a faster roll out of hits
3703650 this is an exciting time to be involved in the organic and ethnic and specialty product sectors particularly as organic and specialty ethnic foods are the two fastest growing segments of retail food sales
3703651 these co located events will offer national and regional forward thinking retailers foodservice professionals and manufacturers access to valuable educational opportunities and sourcing options that will help them stay competitive in the changing landscape of food consumption in north america
3703652 we fully expect the cctbs unique marketing programs coupled with our premier meeting destination will meet all expectations for a successful event
3703653 at hotchalk we saw a significant international demand for our products from early on with users from schools in 188 countries
3703654 this offering fills a tremendous international need for online learning tools in foreign languages vastly improving resources for educators on a global scale it is also an innovative means for teachers in the united states to best educate students whose first language is not english and an alternative method to teach english speaking students foreign languages
3703655 they really went to town breaking windows in the school and then in the nearby house and other buildings its an absolute shame you can see the chips on the walls where they were firing the stones the school had been freshly painted over the summer and so it is very annoying to have that work ruined
3703656 the last few months have seen the national school being painted and so much effort has been put in by volunteers teachers and pupils to obtain the green flag for the school and now this has happened it puts the whole process of improvement backwards
3703657 they are badly bruised and shaken everyone involved is badly shaken
3703658 the shillelagh mentors were not impressed to put it mildly by the delay
3703659 they felt there should be an ambulance at the ground on an evening where two senior championship matches were being played
3703660 everything is going really well she is due to start surgery on thursday
3703661 at the moment she is confined to a wheelchair her motor skills are limited and her hands are also affected
3703662 but she was sick last week so we had to put the surgery off for another week we are praying now that nothing goes wrong this time
3703663 we bred him as a foal 15 years ago from the mare woodlands lady we knew he was good but you never think he would be world class
3703664 we sold call again cavalier as a three year old you cant plan these things you could produce one great horse out of so many
3703665 im in it for the money like you would be with cattle or sheep i do like the horse but i treat it as a business they have to pay their way
3703666 call again cavalier was very settled within himself today in fact he has been really settled and relaxed since he arrived
3703667 you and your horse are a real partnership you cant just buy a good horse and get on it it takes years to get it to the olympic standard and there are very few horses that get to that standard
3703668 i sold him as a twoyear old but in relation to how good he was its very hard to judge at that age
3703669 i sold him to a man in wexford who had him for a year and then sold him to a man in goresbridge who then sold him to a man in limerick from there he went to america
3703670 last year the irish horse board made a presentation to yvonne to acknowledge mckinlaighs achievements up to that
3703671 hes fitter stronger healthier than hes ever been in his whole life
3703672 it definitely has to be a bond it has to be a connection
3703673 what we ask horses to do they have to have a lot of trust in a rider to go over blind drops six anda half feet down into the water
3703674 the rubbish left behind has seen an entire years work by the tidy towns and f s groups undone in just 24 hours
3703675 in the last few years it seems to have started a day or two before august 15 and i dont see any sign that it will change this year
3703676 its not a day we will make any real hay in the shop
3703677 we will just concentrate on sales of confectionary and the deli soft drinks and the like
3703678 its a very different kind of day for us here
3703679 if it was even confined to one area but it takes up the whole street from top to bottom closing the pub is a precautionary move for us our customers know us as a family run pub a typical country bar and we are just not geared up for this kind of thing
3703680 we want to keep traffic away from the main street
3703681 it is not a scheduled event there is no organising committee so this event is not formally planned but the traders are exercising a market right that goes back many years
3703682 we dont envisage a terrible lot of trouble it has passed off without much incident in recent years
3703683 the church was packed with all the families and friends
3703684 all of my family were there including my mother eileen and my brother christy he was there the day of the tragedy
3703685 all the people who were with the boys that day the doyles kellys byrnes they all came down for the mass we are so grateful to all the people who came down
3703686 to tell you the truth it was like a wake again it was like it had only happened yesterday and people are still so heartbroken
3703687 everyones life changed that day at 3 45pm on july 31 you do feel you have to go to the place where it happened i have been there many times you never ever forget
3703688 the wreath had all the names of the people that died all done in their county colours it was a lovely touch
3703689 just seeing the sea down there it was obvious how they didnt stand a chance the pull from the sea is so strong that the sand would just go from beneath you
3703690 the people down there were telling us of the many people who have drowned over the years and also the many who have taken their own lives from the cliffs of moher that are just down the beach from where the boys were drowned
3703691 everyone has been very good especially to my mother and id like to thank everyone

3703697 the same general geographic framework that criminologists use to catch criminals can be used by zoologists as well
3703698 this makes us think that it can be applied to other areas as well like epidemiology
3703699 they want to operate in a comfort zone close to an area they know but not where everyone knows them

3703701 programs such as the go red for women founded by the american heart association aha have made great strides in raising awareness of heart diseases impact on women but the message apparently has not made its way into hispanic communities

3703712 earlier in the year the price of a barrel of oil was at a peak of 147 but since then that has come down to 118
3703713 this should mean that petrol prices here should be closer to 1 not 1 28 as currently priced at some stations in carlow
3703714 the question is why are prices still remaining high and i would encourage people to help bring the prices down by going to the cheapest places
3703715 consumers are not terribly concerned about dates of when the fuel was bought theyre concerned about the reduction on the forecourt
3703716 the visit is recognition for the incredible welcome the international roses received during their last visit to carlow in 2003
3703717 what do we do when the person does not want to help himself herself
3703718 for some more time inflation can increase it could touch 13 percent but by december it will start declining and is likely to moderate to 8 9 percent by march 2009
3703719 there is a slowdown in agriculture industry and services and the global environment is not very conducive to growth this will affect indian economy as well
3703720 we were looking for a technology partner that would complement our efforts in providing hispanics with the best mobile internet experience from any cellular phone
3703721 with netbiscuits mobile web platform not only were we able to accomplish this but we did so with quick turnarounds and at the highest levels of quality which our carrier partners have come to expect from us
3703722 the internet has made it possible for people living outside of their home countries to stay connected with their culture heritage and language with the simple click of the mouse the mobile web should not be treated differently
3703723 working with latcel to bring relevant content to spanish speaking mobile users in the u s is a true testament that it is possible to bring real internet experiences in any language to mobile devices across the world if you have the right technology in hand

3703732 discarding fish not only means a massive waste of food and potential income it also leads to unrecorded catches resulting in a poorer scientific basis for our management decisions
3703733 i want a requirement that all fish caught in norwegian waters also by foreign vessels must be taken to port regardless of which final port is used we will introduce new requirements as a condition for obtaining licenses to fish that vessels cannot discard valuable fish caught here
3703734 this must stop now the eu community cannot be taken seriously if it allows this kind of behaviour this is certainly not how to manage the worlds resources
3703735 it is a disgrace this practice is depleting populations that are already overfished and it is happening everywhere
3703736 all of these fish are perfectly marketable and have been legally caught but if you are a fisherman it makes more economic sense to take boat to market with the most saleable fish so you discard the lowest value stuff
3703737 it is out of contact we very rarely fish in norwegian waters thats the first time in years
3703738 the reason there are discards is the ridiculously low quotas fishermen cannot make a living with them they are at a ridiculous level
3703739 throwing dead fish back into the sea is a waste that nobody wants to see but there is no easy answer the uk is keen to ensure more effective and sustainable fisheries by reducing by catch and discards and the government is working closely with fishermen to achieve that

3703743 he saw the other lads doing the ball throwing and watched their technique and he picked it up straight away and ended up with a gold medal
3703744 ours stayed dry but we had to help other troupes out with theirs
3703745 there was also a computer room with a bank of pcs for the scouts to use the internet bouncy castles and a television and reading area for them
3703746 this data is a vital tool to investigations and intelligence gathering in support of national security and crime
3703747 communications data allows investigators to identify suspects examine their contacts establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time
3703748 it also gives investigators the potential to identify other forensic opportunities identify witnesses and premises of evidential interest
3703749 many alibis are proven or refuted through the use of communications data
3703750 yet again the government has proved itself unable to resist the temptation to take a power quite properly designed to combat terrorism to snoop on the lives of ordinary people in everyday circumstances
3703751 ministers have proven time and time again that they are not to be trusted with sensitive data but they seem intent on pressing ahead with this snoopers charter
3703752 fiorina is a remarkable american success story and one of the nations great business leaders
3703753 her business experience will be vital to senator mccain and the rnc as we travel the country talking about the senators plans to create jobs for working families and set the conditions for economic growth
3703754 the question is does she really have the political experience to be vice president
3703755 she is a very formidable person but i dont think she has the required qualifications to be the vice president
3703756 her knowledge of technology goes a long way to addressing some of the concerns in the mccain campaign
3703757 she has an understanding of what it takes to maintain an edge in technology
3703758 we want to cultivate markets around the world and she has a good understanding of that
3703759 her experience at hp and her knowledge of the industry go a long way
3703760 i think she would actually force the administration to deal more aggressively with flaws in the american education system and enhance math and science learning at the k 12 levels
3703761 one of the keys to maintaining a competitive edge in technology is to develop educational institutions that can train the engineers who are capable of advancing existing products developing new ones and maintaining the competitive edge
3703762 hes using her as a visible outreach to hillary supporters
3703763 hes using her to show that he listens to female voters and that hes interested in courting those voters
3703764 the hillary clinton factor has made her a more attractive candidate
3703765 her addition to the ticket could provide mccain an opportunity to win over democrats particularly older women who were staunch supporters of hillary clinton
3703766 we can see her influence in how theyre using youtube
3703767 part of that is her influence and her understanding of technology theyre suddenly becoming aware of how important the internet is
3703768 shes not nuanced enough to know how to handle hot button issues like abortion
3703769 automation solutions are the only practical way to reduce the high costs of maintaining complex sap systems and we designed our livecompare intelligent impact analysis technology to meet that demand
3703770 our product strategy provides a pure software solution built on a flexible easy to implement intuitive platform that guarantees immediate results
3703771 in many sap change management scenarios a key challenge for sap operations teams is simply to understand the full impact of that change across a live application landscape
3703772 change is the one constant with sap intelligent impact analysis technology makes it possible to automatically answer the most fundamental operational sap questions including those about what has changed and the impact of that change
3703773 the hispanic community is heavily involved in the operations of hotels with spanish spoken at approximately 90 percent of all hotels in the region
3703774 historically the latino community has not been a major player in ownership largely because of the hotel industrys complexity and understanding of investment opportunities that is why hhoa was founded to educate the hispanic community and provide a forum to exchange ideas and build networking relationships we now have more than 300 members and significant support from the leading hotel companies hhoa members have been involved in the acquisition or development of nearly 50 hotels in the past 12 months and we see that number accelerating
3703775 all who met colonel sanders felt his love of education whether in the kitchen welcoming customers or on the road visiting franchisees the colonel was truly dedicated to both teaching and learning everyday

3703777 these are tremendous production numbers and all the credit goes to john brownlie and his team in mexico he was able to increase our gold production while the upgrades and expansion were taking place
3703778 we continue to be on target to meet our stated goal of a 70 000 ounce production rate in 2009
3703779 we have installed additional carbon columns giving us the capacity we require for future planned production additionally the acid wash module will be commissioned next week followed by the carbon strip module and the refinery upgrades
3703780 the final component a new carbon regeneration kiln is being manufactured in the u s and is scheduled for an october delivery once completed we will be able to process solution at a rate in excess of 70 000 ounces per year of gold production

3703788 could be brought down to 8 9 per cent by march 2009 through coordinated policy action
3703789 the bus collided with the van and in turn moved off the road and hit a guard rail
3703790 we were able to get one of the passengers from the back of the van out onto the road but the others were certainly very seriously injured
3703791 the international olympic committee said two croatian athletes and a coach were also on the bus croatian coach dragutin milinkovic was injured and taken to a hospital said gordana gacesa a spokeswoman for the croatian olympic committee
3703792 we couldnt get the two passengers out from the front as for the person who was convulsing i jimmied the van door and helped him away from the scene as far as possible because we were concerned about the leaking fuel from the bus
3703793 if their aim was to break us down mentally and physically they succeeded
3703794 its nothing but racial profiling that led to the death of that young man
3703795 as soon as they see our kids whether theyre black or latino they see criminals the police are hostile to them they arrest them and sometimes they shoot them
3703796 the police see three individuals of non white culture and they automatically get interrogated and questioned
3703797 its not surprising that people at some point might rise up and say they cannot accept it any more
3703798 we are getting in to satisfy tremendous demand in affordable housing
3703799 we find this is a largely uncatered segment and the demand supply gap is ever widening there is lot of scope
3703800 this is a high volume business i cannot disclose the financial details of each project but we are aiming for profit after tax margin of 17 5 to 20 percent
3703801 lamentamos que la aprobaci n de una ley habilitante haya desembocado finalmente en la promulgaci n inconsulta y por tanto contraria al derecho de participaci n ciudadana de numerosos decretos leyes referidos a los mbitos m s diversos de la vida nacional lo cual se agrava por la extemporaneidad de los ltimos decretos
3703802 una primera lectura de estos decretos revela que es necesario prestar atenci n al intervencionismo exacerbado del estado en la econom a al quebrantamiento del principio constitucional de descentralizaci n a la alteraci n del dise o constitucional de la fuerza armada nacional y a las graves amenazas a algunos derechos fundamentales

3703807 if were going to compete internationally for the best and for the brightest we need to improve the way that we attract and retain those who want to work in their fields and contribute to canadian society
3703808 theyre good enough to work here but we dont want them to become canadian citizens
3703809 thats 90 per cent of the 165 000 temporary foreign workers who are working in canada right now
3703810 with nearly full employment an aging population and skill shortages there is an immediate need to ensure canadian employers can access the skills they need
3703811 if anything i said can be interpreted as sexist i unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologize and withdraw my comments
3703812 i have always been a strong supporter of women in politics and want to encourage not hinder their participation in the public sphere
3703813 if they wanted to take me out i would think youd get someone whos looking forward to building a political career not somebody whos at the age where hes considering retirement
3703814 seeing the reaction of people today it would seem my comments were reflecting on the larger group or women in general and that was not the intention of my comment so i thought the only way to put it to bed was to issue an apology and retraction
3703815 when you live in a fish bowl you gotta watch how you swim
3703816 stephane dion must show that these comments are not acceptable in the political process and immediately reprimand his caucus members
3703817 its upsetting and ridiculous to hear this from an elected official
3703818 it should never have happened in the first place there has to be a direct apology to marjory lebreton and i just think its an assault on those who are running and those who would think about running
3703819 why didnt rona ambrose speak out when peter mackay called belinda stronach a dog
3703820 i think its kind of short sighted on her part or anyone elses to insist that thibault be reprimanded
3703821 we are prepared to make these investments because we believe in the value of education we believe in the value of publicly funded education
3703822 and i believe that these proposed changes in the four year collective agreement are good for the system they are good for students and they are good for individual teachers
3703823 we will not sign a long term collective agreement with any school board that does not eliminate the gap
3703824 the catalytic cracking unit is our main gas producing engine at the refinery
3703825 its your finishing unit its like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer youre just not able to finish off the product and get it to market
3703826 gt mccain when i looked at putins eyes i saw 3 letters k g b
3703827 people who have never seen anyone else show these expressions they have the same behavioural responses
3703828 an emotion like fear or anger you dont have to think about who you are
3703829 with pride you do im experiencing these emotions because i just did something that makes me feel good about myself
3703830 if you have a success its really important that other people in the group know that
3703831 pride is a clear signal look at me im powerful
3703832 in western cultures people dont talk about their shame whereas in eastern cultures especially asian cultures shame is an essential part of the cultural fabric
3703833 nobody is going to say you are not supposed to appear but i would say i wasnt necessarily encouraged
3703834 it appears to be consistent with the previous indication that proposed witnesses had given us
3703835 this is a serious matter it has to do with interfering with witnesses this is a committee of parliament
3703836 the chair of a standing committee does not have the authority to take any further steps with regard to this matter
3703837 that the party wasnt really thrilled for you to go
3703838 i am telling you very clearly the national party did not tell any of the witnesses to ignore their summons
3703839 i resent profoundly that the conservative advised lowry whether or not he should attend attending a parliamentary committee is not optional and i resent profoundly them offering him talking points trying to guide what he should and should not say
3703840 i still think it is a valid thing to do
3703841 the reality is that were faced with a slowdown and right now were seeing the commodity trade that whole momentum unravel quickly
3703842 theyre not making any major commitments to the market canada is facing economic headwinds
3703843 when the dollar quits going up gold quits going down its going to take time to repair this dont look for a quick turnaround
3703844 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
3703845 it solidifies us as the place to go for the cool stuff
3703846 we looked into it reviewed the file and felt that payment was necessary
3703847 theres a real uniqueness to this case and thats why we decided to follow through with payment to cover the drug and medical costs of the family
3703848 his case points to the need to take a hard look at the health care system
3703849 there certainly will be others come forward we have people approaching the ministry all the time asking for out of province coverage some are covered some arent
3703850 because we brought it forward is not the reason why were following through with payment
3703851 we looked at it just from our perspective within the ministry as to what our obligations were and felt that we needed to follow through on this compensation
3703852 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3703853 this proves once again the chinese womens team is the best and most excellent i was also surprised at the mistakes made by the u s team
3703854 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3703855 part of the big challenge we have over the next four to six months is to do this complete audit and inventory of just what is out there
3703856 the eight regional health authorities all had individual deficits and im sure there are some things upon which well save as time goes on
3703857 the fact that youve got one region buying equipment and representing four organizations makes the price a lot cheaper
3703858 and all of a sudden you want a magnetic resonance imaging system or three of them in the province of new brunswick its one tender as opposed to three different organizations at different times doing it
3703859 were buying in bulk for one organization and those savings are going to be in the multimillions of dollars
3703860 it will be a lot smarter way to do business
3703861 weve saved a couple of million dollars on the administrative consolidation but thats not going to bail the deficit out at this stage of the game
3703862 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3703863 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3703864 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
3703865 i watched myself on good morning america today and watched myself on the podium
3703866 i looked kind of strange ive had about 80 text messages on my phone from friends back home one of them said dude i am getting sick of seeing your ugly face on television that made me laugh
3703867 for too long canada was here to be a friendly nation and glad hander
3703868 if you come in for the first time you can just get overwhelmed by the whole thing marching in the opening ceremony spending too much time on your feet getting dehydrated and overwhelmed by the magnitude of the games
3703869 im a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude

3703872 it is up to citizens to use them and not just moan in comments to silicon com
3703873 theres a lot of patients who are using these medications who may not need these or may be able to use a different medication that doesnt have these side effects
3703874 if someone has a hip fracture their chance of dying is 20 per cent in six months
3703875 even those who dont die as a result of it theyre still often left with significant disability and loss of independence
3703876 furthermore use has been increasing in recent years likely because of a number of factors including increasing affordability with the emergence of generic and over the counter formulations
3703877 i think patients who are on these medications should discuss it with their physician
3703878 oh man i cant kick this thing this things a mess
3703879 its obviously not healed it had only been a month maybe and it kind of got split on the outside
3703880 i just love scoring no matter what no matter where it is
3703881 so scoring a goal in the olympics against a team like sweden is just a huge feat for me
3703882 shes such a great target player she has a nose for the goal
3703883 and with her there it allows kara lang to play wide right and were three pretty big players up top its nice to have her back
3703884 the ankle felt great and it was great to be out there and contribute in a hard game against sweden
3703885 the injury luke suffered is not all that uncommon for golfers and baseball players and im confident he will make a full recovery with the proper rehabilitation and training
3703886 while there is never a good time for an injury the timing of this injury was especially disappointing for me considering that it forced me to miss the open championship and it comes in a ryder cup year
3703887 but taking proper care of it is my highest priority and im encouraged by dr weilands experience with this type of injury and his outlook towards my recovery and rehabilitation
3703888 we are seeing qila become more comfortable around the calf and spending short periods of time with the calfs grandmother
3703889 it will be interesting to see if there is spontaneous lactation
3703890 there has been lots of contact calling from the calf
3703891 the secret marketing mindset how the most successful internet marketers continually make millions instantly and for the first time ever ive put together a secret marketing success guide that almost all of the most successful internet marketers use and follow
3703892 i want to give love to socially neglected parts of you thats my mission
3703893 i sat in their room the other night and just watched them
3703894 their cribs are close together and they held each others hands as they fell asleep
3703895 it was so neat to see them comfort one another
3703896 we want to have a nice quiet low key day
3703897 maybe go for a walk in the country visit some friends
3703898 we wanted to make sure everyone that we were close to all the people whove supported us could be there
3703899 so we could say we did it we made it to a year and all of you helped us out
3703900 they couldnt figure out how to blow out the candles so their cousins helped them
3703901 by the time they were done there was more cake in their hair and on their faces than in their mouths

3703918 i know iiiiii couldnt do it cause id be pms ing and freaking out all the time
3703919 hoorde u hoe de toonhoogte halverwege wat zakte en aan het einde weer omhoogging
3703920 de mensen willen graag autoruiten die aan de bovenkant een beetje bol staan dat ziet er mooier uit het gevolg is wel dat de ruit halverwege een beetje klem in de sponning komt te zitten en er pas aan het eind weer mooi inpast de elektromotor voor de raambediening moet dus in het midden harder werken en zakt iets in toerental en in toonhoogte constructief gezien is dat geen enkel probleem maar de klant krijgt de indruk dat die motor het maar n t trekt en dat is strijdig met het beeld dat ze van een bmw hebben
3703921 na het uiterlijk van een auto is het geluid het eerste dat een aspirant koper opvalt de betrouwbaarheid de veiligheid en de milieuvriendelijkheid zijn ook allemaal belangrijke factoren maar een nieuwe klant die een proefrit maakt merkt daar niets van je moet hem pakken met het uiterlijk met styling en met geluid
3703922 wij ontwerpen geluiden die niet authentiek zijn maar die de klanten voor authentiek houden
3703923 een autodeur is van dun plaatstaal gemaakt hij is maar 0 7 mm dik heel normaal dat je een blikkerig geluid krijgt als je die dichtslaat maar een bmw rijder verwacht een solide klik dus wij monteren antidreun matten en we passen de constructie van het portierslot aan
3703924 aanvankelijk was geluid vooral iets wat bestreden moest worden bijvoorbeeld bij stofzuigers ze maken nu veel minder geluid dan vroeger

3703927 denk maar aan de klappen die een harley davidson motorfiets maakt het is een belangrijk deel van de identiteit van dat merk maar ze kunnen met geluid ook informatie overdragen een bliepje dat je vertelt dat je een toets van je telefoon goed hebt ingedrukt een reeks piepjes als je de veiligheidsgordels niet omdoet of met het opgewekte plieng als de magnetron klaar is met je eten dat moet allemaal ontworpen worden
3703928 een luxe personenwagen moet zijdezacht lopen een sportwagen mag best wat rauwer klinken en bij een suv moet je de indruk krijgen dat die zich door elke modderpoel heen kan werken we kunnen al die geluiden nu op de computer simuleren en op die manier beslissen hoe een nieuwe auto moet gaan klinken
3703929 het is alleen wel jammer dat hoe zuiniger je een motor maakt des te rauwer hij gaat klinken daar is niet zo veel aan te doen
3703930 we zijn er al lang mee bezig we hebben al heel vroeg de cd laatjes zo gemaakt dat ze soepel klinken en geen plastic geratel produceren
3703931 toen de philips whirlpool wasmachines werden uitgerust met antigeluid een voorziening die door het produceren van geluid in tegenfase hinderlijk geluid kan onderdrukken kregen we veel wasmachines terug met kapot gerukte handels de machines waren zo stil geworden dat de mensen dachten dat ze het niet deden
3703932 ik rijd in een toyota prius en als je op een parkeerterrein manoeuvreert horen de mensen je niet want dat doet hij op zijn elektromotor ik heb al een paar keer gehad dat voetgangers schrokken omdat ze mijn auto niet hadden opgemerkt blijkbaar houd je er onbewust rekening mee dat je oren je wel zullen waarschuwen

3703989 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3703990 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3703991 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3703992 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right

3704028 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3704029 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3704030 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3704031 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3704032 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3704037 giving only scotland a say on independence negates the existence of britain
3704038 that our civil liberties should be traded in such a bazaar is it appropriate or right that we should trade votes at the united nations on the basis of such political pandering
3704039 i had always viewed membership of this house as a noble endeavour not least because we and our forebears have for centuries fiercely defended the fundamental freedoms of our citizens or we did up until yesterday but in truth 42 days is just one perhaps the most salient example of the insidious surreptitious and relentless erosion of fundamental british freedoms this cannot go on it must be stopped and for that reason i feel that today its incumbent on me to take a stand
3704040 davis was guilty of flawed judgment erratic temperament and unrestrained ego raged the times leader his behaviour was egregiously self serving his resignation statement weary rhetoric the guardian s julian glover thought daviss decision the result of some sort of extraordinary brainstorm the telegraph s iain martin saw it as monumentally wrong headed the mirror s kevin maguire as the mother of all bad political stunts the independent s michael brown as truly bizarre and that was just in the papers that agreed with davis at least on being against 42 day detentions on the pro 42 days side the sun s headlines were davis is a quitter who dares whinges davis is a former sas man geddit and crazy davis

3704044 the conservative partys members website conservativehome also said this morning a clear majority of the british people favour a longer detention period we believe that the british people are right they wont readily forgive any politicians who allow a major atrocity to occur because our detention procedures prove to be inadequate the right honourable gentleman must answer also to members of his own party
3704045 if the prime minister is saying that it is popular to announce that you are going to bang up terrorist suspects for longer without charging them he is right it is popular but the point is that we in the house are meant to do what is right
3704046 it seems to me that we should put in place the legislation in a moment of calm i do not want in a moment of panic for people to have to come to the house to bring in emergency legislation
3704047 a clear majority of the british people favour a longer detention period
3704048 whether the by election is seen as a narrowly defined plebiscite on the question of 42 days or on the wider philosophical question of our basic liberties these are surely issues of concern to the nation as a whole

3704051 there is something undeniably inspiring about mr davis forsaking his career to protest against the increasing power of the state for the millions who despise the westminster system it is an encouraging gesture and it will help the tories that the maverick in question is wearing a blue rosette but this is a one man charge of the light brigade westminsters reaction is the same as general bosquets at balaclava cest magnifique mais ce nest pas la guerre for a political warrior like mr davis it is certainly a romantic way to leave the battlefield but mr cameron is now determined that there should be no route back

3704075 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3704076 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3704077 women kind of wilt as men sort of achieve as they get older like wine or whatever its like oh shes past her prime and she cant play a sex symbol
3704078 its just a preconceived notion about women in general and particularly in this industry its a very vain vain industry

3704084 it seems to be linked to the battles of last year between fatah al islam and the army because the target was clearly the lebanese army and thats an ongoing fight it doesnt seem to be a continuation of the troubles that tripoli is having the last couple of months it seems to have a different nature
3704085 its also curious that its done on the day that the president is going to syria which might be a signal to both lebanon and syria that the radical jihadi groups are still capable of inflicting harm even if lebanon and syria cooperate theyre still around
3704086 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3704087 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3704088 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3704089 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3704090 lebanon and the lebanese will not kneel or submit to the criminals and the terrorists

3704134 reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence
3704135 it is imperative particularly in more challenging financial conditions that firms have in place appropriate systems and controls to manage their risks
3704136 the sudden and unexpected announcement of the write down had the potential to undermine market confidence
3704137 i would have been quite happy with a top 20
3704138 people are hell bent on medals but thats not what its all about
3704139 it definitely is not one of my best performances but im glad i came here and got the experience
3704140 it was a tough course but i pretty much knew it from the road race
3704141 i have been stepping it up every time it was a step up again today i had to do the sprint finish but it was brilliant
3704142 it was very close in the end i am more than pleased with that i would have taken any of the top three places i am in the final and i dont care what lane i get
3704143 i came here with the intention of producing an olympic performance i am doing that now and i will produce a big one on finals day
3704144 realistically any one of us can win it i have an outside chance the underdogs chance but it is always better to be the underdog
3704145 that was a good challenge for us because in the final more crews will stay with us for longer
3704146 we have come a long way from the heat but and well have to step on it again but seeing where we have come from over the last three days i would back ourselves to do it

3704150 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
3704151 martha jones ex time traveller and now working as a doctor for a un task force has been called to cern the worlds largest particle physics laboratory in geneva where theyre about to activate the large hadron collider lhc
3704152 the lhc is a particle accelerator which has been built deep underground in a 27 km tunnel under switzerland and france once activated the collider will fire beams of protons together recreating conditions a billionth of a second after the big bang and potentially allowing the human race a greater insight into what the universe is made of
3704153 but so much could go wrong it could open a gateway to a parallel dimension or create a black hole and now voices from the past are calling out to people and scientists have started to disappear
3704154 he has a lot to learn and has only been here in belfast for just over a week but so far we have been very impressed with him both as a person and a player
3704155 it will be a steep learning curve for him here but we are very pleased with him so far
3704156 it is great to get the younger players from the academy to train with us and to expose them to the senior squad and the level that the seniors play at
3704157 bath are a great club they play a fantastic style of rugby so we are looking forward to the challenge

3704163 dublin strike me as being a more composed side than three seasons ago when we beat them in the championship after a replay
3704164 many of those same players are now three years old have during that time added three further leinster titles
3704165 people always question the quality of football in the different provinces but this year more than any its very hard to answer that question
3704166 leinster in fairness has become quite competitive again and dublin have still prevailed during that period and that says a lot for them as a team both in terms of reserve pure ability and mental strength
3704167 make no mistake they are a very good side many have them second favourites behind kerry to win the all ireland and on their record over the last few year its difficult to argue with that assessment
3704168 they lost out on that occasion and they have had three seasons to dwell on it so revenge could be their motivation
3704169 for us its great memory and something we will never ever forget
3704170 it was also a major stepping stone for lifting sam maguire for a second time the following month it will be a huge test and whoever triumphs will be the better for the result
3704171 when the police started moving us away from the top of the street we just thought it was a sad hoax
3704172 he picked me up but he couldnt carry me for long because blood was pouring down his arm my mummy told me not to leave her
3704173 we were left with fragments of bone eggshells of bone to try and put together to try and see if you could stabilise anything
3704174 during the first month of operations i was just hoping that i would get some sight back and maybe things would be ok
3704175 but i kind of got used to living that month without sight and realised id be able to get on with life
3704176 when i was flown over omagh by the raf i was watching the pilots very closely i knew then that one day i could be a pilot
3704177 i seem to get a sore arm more often but when im training its fine
3704178 ive realised that you only have one shot at life and you cant waste it
3704179 when i arrived in northern ireland i was taken into a room to be told fernando was dead and my daughter lucrecia was injured
3704180 it was like being tortured like someone ripping away part of you
3704181 it was so sad but it meant we could connect with him even though he wasnt with us any more
3704182 i could see this green blood stained sheet over him and a piece of cloth covered his face it was taken off and james eyes were wide open beautiful green eyes i wrapped my arms around his head and he was very cold i never knew how green his eyes were until that moment
3704183 it certainly had consequences for me and my wife and also for my children my reaction was to come into work and put my head down and pursue justice
3704184 ive lost 10 years of my life with anger and bitterness
3704185 ive lost 10 years of my children growing up and i want to put that right for the next 10 years and make good somehow

3704194 if you sit down for the poker table and can not calculate luzera it is you
3704195 you could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread so you would be foolish not to
3704196 could this somehow be indirect russian action yes but considering russia is past playing nice and uses real bombs they could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the infrastructure kinetically
3704197 the attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that have been used by the r b n and in some cases the attacks are being launched from computers they are known to control
3704198 we are simply seeing the attacks coming from known hosting services

3704204 when there isnt demand you cant do new issues and then you are forced to cut
3704205 i know we wanted to have something hanging around our necks
3704206 i think any time you put up 10 runs in a game its a good one

3704208 any of the eight guys could be on the podium i have to calm down go relax and get focused
3704209 for us a few too many mistakes on the synchronized part
3704210 theres no margin for mistakes against these guys at least mistakes like we did
3704211 the first fencer i fought had a very strong technique which better suited my fencing style i prefer attacks which give me more time to react
3704212 the italian sanzo in my second bout was very fast and because of his style i had little time to react he dominated throughout the competition

3704214 its important for marketers to understand the shift the industry has taken from brands speaking to consumers to the brand enabling consumers to speak to other consumers

3704349 our performance in the fourth quarter was helped by an impressive 44 increase in international sales however overall sales in both our protect amp direct and inform segments declined as we continue to see domestic economic pressures impact state and municipal spending on transportation safety products in the u s due to the lower sales volumes we also saw lower profitability in both segments our strong international sales were driven by growth in both the european and asia pacific regions approximately 24 of our overall sales were generated from international sales in fiscal 2008 compared with 19 a year ago looking forward we expect our international sales to be an increasingly important part of our overall business
3704350 the recent sale of the intersection control segment is an important step for quixote that strengthens our financial position and provides us with additional capital as we strategically focus on our significant international growth opportunities one recent international initiative was the opening of a new office in dubai which resulted in nearly 1 million in revenue this year we believe our local presence in the middle east will be an important factor in penetrating this very attractive market in addition we also plan to continue investing in the development of new products such as our vorteq tm truck mounted attenuator and our vulcan r moveable steel barrier which will help increase sales both here and abroad by offering our customers increasingly innovative solutions to address their needs
3704351 while the domestic marketplace remains challenging we are taking the necessary steps to move forward as a stronger company and plan to continue investing in international opportunities and in new product lines to position ourselves in the most compelling markets with industry leading products and services while the near term outlook for domestic state and municipal spending on transportation safety products remains uncertain there remains a need to invest in an aging u s infrastructure that has to be addressed we believe our current strategic focus will help offset the current uncertainty in the domestic market and position us for long term growth once domestic infrastructure spending improves
3704352 during the second quarter of this year we made significant progress in the development of our smartchip real time pcr system as evidenced by the initiation of alpha testing by dr steven shapiro and his team at the university of pittsburgh medical school
3704353 we look forward to working closely with dr shapiro through the alpha testing process and expect to announce results in the second half of this year

3704359 our gross profit margin for the six month period ended june 30 2008 increased to 19 1 percent compared to 14 8 percent for the same period in 2007 and was 19 6 percent compared to 12 2 percent for the three months periods ended june 30 2008 and 2007 respectively there were several factors that contributed to the increase including more efficient project execution on a number of projects cost savings related to the success of our global procurement initiative and the completion of warranty periods on several projects at better than historical levels resulting in the release of provisions on the expiration of these warranty periods
3704360 we must continue to concentrate on execution margins converting the strong backlog into earnings and building the value of khd in a risk prudent manner we continue to build our capability and capacity to offer and successfully execute an expanded scope of services the nature of the potential work and the location of certain opportunities result in a risk profile that could be higher than our traditional services we continue to be selective in choosing which opportunities we have and will pursue with a renewed emphasis on value margin and risk furthermore we have and will continue to target higher margin projects on a global basis rather than our historical practice of targeting the highest margin projects in a specific geography we believe it is important our shareholders clearly understand our strategy and although a consequence of this strategy may be fewer mega project awards compared to some of our competitors the objective of our strategy is continued generation of quality earnings
3704361 we continue to hold 100 million of cash earmarked for investment in growth in dollars rather than in euros the recent appreciation of the dollar against the euro which significantly reduces the reported unrealized foreign exchange loss on these funds illustrates the need from an economic perspective for khd to hold cash in both us dollars and euros
3704362 our general and administrative expenses excluding stock based compensation increased to 26 6 million for the six month period ended june 30 2008 from 20 3 million in 2007 and for the three month period ended june 30 2008 it increased to 13 7 million from 10 8 million in 2007 a large proportion of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than the dollar a weakening of the dollar therefore increases our reported expenses general and administrative expenses increased for the six month period by approximately 2 9 million and for the three month period by 1 5 million as a consequence of the weakening dollar additional costs related to wabush iron ore royalty arbitration were also incurred the remaining increase is primarily linked to the growth of administrative and supporting services for the expansion of business activities

3704446 evidence suggests that some of the same neural machinery recruited in the experience of pain may also be associated with social separation or rejection
3704447 the feelings induced by experimental games in the laboratory are a pale shadow of the real life feelings that humans and other animals experience in response to the sudden loss of social support
3704448 psychological pain in humans especially grief and intense loneliness may share some of the same neural pathways that elaborate physical pain
3704449 we are finding more scientific differences between men and women as we improve research methods and broaden study populations
3704450 this growing base of research will help us develop more effective treatments based on a new criteria gender
3704451 the reason for the two different brain responses may date back to primitive days when the roles of men and women were more distinct
3704452 given that some pain syndromes require multi drug treatments for the control of pain these studies provide information for rationally based differential processes in men and women
3704453 pain is a lot more complex in humans than animals
3704454 its a gross oversimplification to say theres a gender difference in response to pain
3704455 the perception is that if a man abstains for a long time hell improve his fertility
3704456 thats true to a point five days but beyond that things start to go downhill a bit
3704457 the longer the sperm hang around in the male reproductive tract they begin to degenerate die and release free radicals which will then damage other sperm

3704463 if an alien landed on earth they would think the only thing we do is have sex
3704464 if lovers swear their feelings to be ever lasting the hormones tell a different story
3704465 whether more nerve growth is needed in the early stage of romance because of all the new experiences that are engraved into the brain or whether it has a second as yet unknown function in the chemistry of love remains to be explored
3704466 it shows that different hormones are present in the blood when people are acutely in love while there is no evidence of the same hormones in people who have been in a stable relationship for many years
3704467 in fact the love molecules can disappear as early as 12 months after a relationship has started to be replaced by another chemical glue that keeps couples together
3704468 to any romantically inclined chemist it should be deeply satisfying to be able to prove that chemical messengers communicate romantic feeling between humans
3704469 it may be the only thing that science can offer as a real world analogy to cupids arrows
3704470 this feeds into a 1970s view that when you meet its all sparky and then its a downward trajectory to cuddles which is seen as a negative

3704767 the adjustment of the uk economy to higher commodity prices and a more realistic pricing of credit will be painful

3704772 ing continues to weather the turmoil in credit markets well as writedowns on pressurised assets remained limited in the second quarter

3704774 equity gains net of impairments were significantly below the exceptional levels realised last year
3704775 combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline

3704780 the new generation of 15 to 20 year olds are they going to gear themselves towards travelling the world for nine months of the year playing five day cricket or earn plenty by playing three hour cricket a little bit in india and at home im not too sure

3704786 this explosion is not in either lebanon or syrias interests especially since president sleiman is expected to visit damascus today

3704811 ik hoorde ioc voorzitter jacques rogge zeggen dat het slecht gaat met de belgische sport omdat ons land maar 30 miljoen euro per jaar investeert
3704812 rogge vindt dat te weining in vergelijking met bijvoorbeeld frankrijk of groot brittanni

3704888 the operation was halted not because president george bush had made a request but because the goals set by the russian president had been attained
3704889 this role cannot be doubted it has been and will be played scrupulously

3704901 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3704902 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3704903 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college
3704904 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3704905 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3704906 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3704907 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives

3704913 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3704914 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3704915 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3704916 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3704917 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3704918 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3704919 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3704920 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3704921 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3704922 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3704923 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore

3704925 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3704926 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3704927 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3704928 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3704929 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3704930 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3704931 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3704932 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3704933 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3704934 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades

3704952 aquella impotencia e indefensi n del ayer hoy la estamos derrotando con el renacer de la conciencia del pueblo argentino seguir insistiendo en su pedido de disculpas en nombre del estado nacional argentino al pueblo chaque o a los fusilados a los desaparecidos a los agraviados porque reci n por primera vez despu s de 31 a os un presidente de la naci n est presente ac

3704962 in addition the prevalence of hiv infection and potential risk factors differed by gender but a finding we didnt anticipate is that living in tijuana for longer periods was associated with lower hiv prevalence in men which is the opposite of what we found in women among women longer term residents in tijuana actually had a higher risk of hiv infection
3704963 with disintegrating family support networks sudden changes in a persons cultural environment homelessness and poverty were more apt to see risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with sex workers other men or sharing injection needles among male migrants
3704964 however an alternate explanation could be that deportation from the united states leads to social upheaval loss of social ties and income factors which lead to engaging in high risk behaviors
3704965 much of the criticism directed towards the gimp come from users who do not or should not need to use it
3704966 much of the criticism directed towards the gimp come from users who do not or should not need to use it
3704967 this is such a fun place to be part of staff is so fun to get to know from their cleaning lady with all the cats to management from monk murry and
3704968 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3704969 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3704970 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3704971 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3704972 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3704973 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3704974 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3704975 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3704976 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3704977 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3704978 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3704979 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3704980 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3704981 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3704982 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3704983 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3704984 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3704985 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3704986 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3704987 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3704988 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3704989 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3704990 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3704991 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3704992 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3704993 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3704994 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3704995 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3704996 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3704997 not only do i know how you can have everlasting life but i know how you can make your life here fulfilling beyond your wildest dreams

3705034 as i was going to get my car in the early hours of last tuesday morning i was attacked by three young thai guys they hit me over the head with a rock in trying to defend myself my arm got hit by another rock one of these guys was to use on me although dripping with blood from my head i took off after them to retaliate and chased them for 20 minutes on foot considering they were half my age they finally were able to out run me there is no doubt in my mind that these guys were paid by someone to do this my injuries were not that serious and i was back at work in living dolls showcase the next night and contrary to what some misinformed internet authors have written i have no plans to leave thailand

3705043 yes we did come close to signing rangers star carlos cuellar
3705044 we did make inquiries and i was more than confident but once you hear that a club of villas size are in for him big time you clearly fear the worst
3705045 of course its disappointing but there is no point dwelling on it we are out there not just looking but making serious attempts to bring new faces in

3705052 es dif cil de explicar el cambio desde que llegu hasta ahora no se puede valorar es un cambio muy radical el primer d a no era valorable porque sufr a el cambio horario y cansancio con muchos partidos pero en competici n todo es distinto
3705053 la cabeza vuelve a estar en marcha en cuanto empiezan los partidos en los encuentros inconscientemente te preparas para competir mentalmente necesitaba un par n no entren muy bien pero cada d a me encontraba algo mejor y cuando empez la competici n ya me encontr mejor que cuando entrenaba los primeros d as me faltaba una semana

3705055 its a flick titled the heist that im doing with t i idris elba and matt dillon
3705056 im activity a killer im not feat to provide anything added away its a bank robbing movie so its digit of those action packed films

3705067 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and coordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
3705068 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3705069 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3705070 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3705071 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3705072 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3705073 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3705074 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3705075 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3705076 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3705077 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3705078 the credit crunch is there and everybody has been affected by it we dont get away just because we are a football club
3705079 the banks are now tighter and not prepared to put debt on you just cannot continue to increase debts
3705080 i did say we intended to bring in three top players but that was before the credit crunch
3705081 the owner has already invested an incredible amount of money but we cannot keep spending the amount we have spent since the summer of 2007 in excess of 60million on players alone
3705082 on top of that you have agents fees while the wage bill has gone up substantially all that and with just 20 000 coming through the gates
3705083 people have to be realistic a few players might arrive but not for big money

3705096 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3705097 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3705098 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3705099 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3705100 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3705101 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3705102 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3705103 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3705104 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3705105 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3705106 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3705107 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3705108 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3705109 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3705110 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3705111 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3705112 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3705113 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3705114 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3705115 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3705116 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3705117 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3705118 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3705119 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3705120 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3705121 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3705122 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3705123 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3705124 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3705125 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3705126 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3705127 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3705128 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3705129 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3705130 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3705131 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3705132 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3705133 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3705134 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3705135 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3705136 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3705137 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3705138 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3705139 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3705140 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3705141 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3705142 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3705143 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3705144 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3705145 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3705146 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3705147 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3705148 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3705149 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3705150 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3705151 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3705152 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3705153 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3705154 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3705155 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3705156 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3705157 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3705158 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3705159 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3705160 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3705161 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3705162 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3705163 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3705164 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3705165 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3705166 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3705167 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3705168 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3705169 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3705170 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3705171 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3705172 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3705173 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3705174 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3705175 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3705176 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3705177 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3705178 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3705179 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3705180 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3705181 just so you all know we did set a record
3705182 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3705183 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3705184 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3705185 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3705186 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3705187 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3705188 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3705189 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3705190 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3705191 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3705192 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3705193 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3705194 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3705195 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3705196 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3705197 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3705198 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3705199 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3705200 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3705201 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3705202 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3705203 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3705204 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3705205 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3705206 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3705207 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3705208 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3705209 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3705210 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3705211 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3705212 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3705213 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3705214 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap

3705216 well where some people have mental or physical blocks i guess i have a mush block damned if it didnt happen again i even stood there watching it while it went flop flop flop when lo and behold there wasnt a flop left in it the thing just lay there looking at me kind of darkly it was dead id killed it and who wants to eat dead oatmeal so i put the pan in the sink and squirted water in it psheeee breakfast was over
3705217 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3705218 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3705219 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3705220 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3705221 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3705222 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3705223 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3705224 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3705225 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3705226 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3705227 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3705228 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3705229 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3705230 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3705231 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3705232 obviously teens still like international celebrities but the fact that they chose indiana evans over miley cyrus shows they often still connect a lot more with aussie celebs
3705233 she hawkins obviously looks amazing but isnt too fashiony shes still accessible to our readers crisp said
3705234 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3705235 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3705236 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3705237 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3705238 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3705239 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3705240 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3705241 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3705242 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3705243 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3705244 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3705245 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3705246 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3705247 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3705248 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3705249 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3705250 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3705251 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3705252 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3705253 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3705254 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3705255 the administration on the ground should liaise with security officers to give the actual figures of youths in remand and those declared missing
3705256 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3705257 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3705258 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3705259 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3705260 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3705261 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3705262 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3705263 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3705264 iphone and nokia owners who regularly call north america can purchase truphones bundle to get peace of mind pricing of just 1 5 us cents 0 75 pence per minute to the usa and canada from anywhere in the world people dont want to calculate precise per minute rates or check tariff websites or take a paid for tariff bolt on to get a still high rate they simply want to feel comfortable about what theyre going to pay for the call they want to make
3705265 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3705266 one of the major benefits of logbook loans is that you can often get access to cash on the same day that you submit your application
3705267 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3705268 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3705269 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3705270 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3705271 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3705272 i was able to read the tutors article about his recent concert tour and so get some background information about him before getting in touch
3705273 our results show that almost half of people questioned felt they had bought their endowment policy on a false promise this is not just a case of a small purchase this is thousands of pounds for a house that we are talking about
3705274 there are several reasons that somebody may have been mis sold an endowment policy including a lack of adequate explanation an endowment policy is not a short term commitment and this should have been made clear when the policy was bought as should the fees and risks involved
3705275 without this information people were unable to make an informed decision and should be able to claim some compensation depending on the circumstances
3705276 in collaboration with the co located ict symposium this years event will combine telecommunications solutions with innovations for enterprise
3705277 the exhibition and workshops will cover technology business strategic and operational issues on topics such as mobility collaboration security and risk management and address the most promising alternatives for moving forward in the ict industry

3705284 good email delivered to the inbox is welcomed but people hate spam and are equally frustrated when valid email is unnecessarily blocked however the picture has improved significantly in recent years today all the parties involved in email marketing recognise that they have to collaborate if the industry is to combat spam and ensure that the medium achieves its potential
3705285 a growing spirit of openness has seen isps become richer sources of information which in turn enables email marketers to respond by using the sophisticated capabilities of lyris listmanager 10 everyone wins because less spam is delivered and more legitimate messages get in to the inbox
3705286 ensuring that email messages make it to the inbox continues to be a critical challenge for email marketers particularly as spam volumes increase and internet service providers isps change their guidelines for which messages get delivered
3705287 with over 40 years experience in information security and having worked closely with the information security forum it is clear that its role is more important than ever
3705288 information security is no longer just a technical challenge it is a business imperative and is or should be on the top of boardroom agendas in every corporation the isf is a unique organization that provides a confidential peer to peer forum for members across different countries sectors and disciplines and is able to draw on their diverse skills and expertise to distill best practice and deliver an unmatched portfolio of research methodologies and tools
3705289 it is a distinct privilege to be the first president of the isf and i look forward to working with the dedicated professionals that have brought the isf to the position it is today i will strive to help raise greater awareness of the information security challenges faced today from the increase in cybercrime to the growing burden of compliance companies need to adopt a risk management perspective and recognize that information security is business driven and not crisis driven
3705290 we are delighted that howard schmidt has accepted this important position at the isf
3705291 the value of the isf has always been born out of the people in the organization its members our expert consultants and the management team it is clear that howards unparalleled experience and knowledge will make a major contribution to the future of the isf and its members he will also be driving our ambitious plans to expand the scale and reach of the isf building on our existing membership from europe and scandinavia through the americas to the middle east india africa australia and the pacific rim
3705292 the timing is right for this demonstration weve seen a massive increase of interest in targeted advertising and are already working with iptv broadcasters network owners and vendors not to mention advertising agencies and brands mobile tv is a vital part of the rapidly changing world of tv and is a vital part of our roadmap like packet vision udcast is a pioneer in its particular area of innovation with a proven track record and global reach so there is a natural synergy between the two companies
3705293 we expect targeted advertising to be an important element of mobile tv business models including free to air services where finding ways to generate revenue from advertising will be essential udcasts mobile tv solutions are compliant with majority of standards deployed across the world we are in an ideal position to provide the global platform for delivering mobile tv so it makes sense to work with packet vision which we believe is at the forefront of delivering targeted advertising technology on ip video networks
3705294 our customers must be able to focus on their business objectives and keeping end user satisfaction high
3705295 working with toucan global demonstrates how realtunnel through its support for ice stun turn and https tunneling is a key contributor to optimizing end users voip experiences
3705296 with paradial toucan global can increase the availability and usefulness of the snap communicator
3705297 local councils can find out the number and cause of avoidable contacts which is the first step to reducing them
3705298 the fact that simple transactions are increasingly satisfied by consumer self service internet and systems means person to person contacts tend to be more complex and take longer
3705299 reducing avoidable contact gives more capacity to handle unavoidable contacts more effectively and reduce overall workload
3705300 the online retail market is fiercely competitive consumers expect to be able to shop quickly and easily even minor glitches in this process will lead customers to abandon their trolleys and go elsewhere

3705307 there are lots of options for young people to build a successful career in their industry of choice however if youre young and starting to make money its a good idea to start thinking about saving for the future nobodys young forever
3705308 many 16 21 year olds now make the choice to go straight to work rather than university and as a result are very career driven we think it is important to recognise those who are just starting out in their working life and offer them support especially in the first stages of their professional lives when they are likely to be making important financial decisions
3705309 with this in mind the premier 21 account has been launched to allow this group to maximise the potential of their hard earned cash the account offers a 10 interest rate the highest credit interest rate on the high street to help make their money go further
3705310 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3705311 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3705312 i have not seen a great willingness yet by these companies to do that
3705313 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable

3705319 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3705320 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3705321 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word

3705336 honor achievements that first make people laugh and then make them think the prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual honor the imaginative and spur peoples interest in science medicine and technology

3705341 i would have loved to compete on four events but the silver medal for my team is great
3705342 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3705343 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3705344 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3705345 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3705346 in spite of the current slowdown in the telecom sector korea has become the worlds most exciting broadband market with the highest broadband penetration in the world which is about 96 per cent this event will enable indian industry and policy makers to interact with the korean industry and government to understand the policies and procedures which has resulted into such a high penetration the digital opportunity forum brings together a unique mix of industry government and regulatory leaders to explore new business and discuss policies that affect investment in and growth of the telecommunications sector
3705347 india is witnessing highest growth in telecom sector with addition of more than 8 9 million subscribers per month india is already the second highest in telecom subscriber base with 300 million subscribers and is poised to reach 500 million by 2010 the broadband target has been set as 20 million by the year 2010
3705348 we are all in the mud but some of us are looking at the stars
3705349 wimax devices and networks are available now for deployment worldwide delivering best in class broadband services at a cost to consumers significantly lower than any other technology india is clearly making the commitment and taking the steps to ensure wireless broadband services are a reality that enables operators to meet the needs of indias diverse and growing population
3705350 in addition an operators investment to afford the build out of infrastructure and deployment of the service is at the lowest capex and the best roi models plus the economies of scale created by this demand will help drive down the cost of the wide range of diverse wimax devices all of the leading telecom equipment manufacturers are having their wimax base station and other infrastructure equipment wimax forum certified and are ready to showcase their equipment in india
3705351 the wimax forum is pleased that the indian government plans to auction blocks in the 700 mhz and 3 3 3 6 ghz bands as they become available the wimax forum expects to certify the first 3 5 ghz wimax products by the end of 2008 and views 700 mhz as a strong contender for mobile internet services especially in indias low density rural areas
3705352 the federal government conceded the nine vaccines hannah received on july 19 2000 significantly aggravated an underlying medical condition mitochondrial dysfunction
3705353 the interagency autism coordinating committee refused to mention vaccine safety in its strategic plan
3705354 a loud wake up call from a beautiful little redheaded girl from georgia has provided policy makers with a historic opportunity to tackle critical issues of vaccine safety if they fail to answer what can i say
3705355 theres a lot of misinformation so thats why this study is so important
3705356 hundreds and hundreds of parents think this works but we need serious evidence
3705357 the belief that you can inform and warn people and get them to take appropriate actions or precautions with respect to a health threat or risk without actually making them anxious or concerned this is not possible this is like breaking up with your boyfriend without hurting his feelings it cant be done
3705358 vaccination demand particularly among people who dont routinely receive an annual influenza vaccination is related to heightened concern anxiety and worry
3705359 evidence from systematic reviews shows that inactivated vaccines flu vaccines have little or no effect on the effects measured little comparative evidence exists on the safety of these vaccines reasons for the current gap between policy and evidence are unclear but given the huge resources involved a re evaluation should be urgently undertaken the optimistic and confident tone of some predictions of viral circulation and of the impact of inactivated vaccines which are at odds with the evidence is striking
3705360 little comparative evidence exists on the safety of these vaccines
3705361 they had their flu shots last fall and everything went downhill from there
3705362 why the p in the dpt vaccination may be hazardous to your childs health
3705363 when statistics are applied to the study of vaccines political immunology demonstrates its infinite flexibility statistical evidence demonstrating cause and effect is denied when this same evidence applied to any other branch of medicine would be accepted without question
3705364 this convenient method of reasoning was displayed with particular clarity in connection with the governments investigation of sids deaths in tennessee
3705365 a statistical analysis of the clustering of deaths revealed that the likelihood of observing four or more deaths occurring randomly on any of the first eight days after the use of lot 64201 was 3 in 100
3705366 the statistical evidence in favor of a connection between the deaths and the dpt shot was strong would the medical authorities bite the bullet and admit the vaccine was related to the deaths absolutely not
3705367 the tombstone was placed on what happened in tennessee three years later in the september 1982 issue of the journal of pediatrics when bernier and his colleagues at the cdc wrote their epitaph on the infant deaths
3705368 apparently also decided to act to prevent a clustering of deaths following dpt vaccination from a single lot from ever occurring again in a single geographical area
3705369 if we dont change her now well have to wait until next year which could be late
3705370 the dollars gain is positive for companies that export and the drop in oil

3705392 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3705393 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3705394 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3705395 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3705396 the more the chinese become dependent on the rest of the world the more the rest of the world has influence
3705397 i dont think we should legitimize their government which oppresses people

3705410 la russia ha vinto questa partita dal punto di vista militare e politico in cinque giorni riuscita a ricostruire la sua influenza nel caucaso meridionale e ha allontanato per decenni ripeto per decenni la possibilit che la georgia ma qualsiasi altro paese confinante con mosca possa aderire alla nato come invece volevano gli stati uniti come sognavano a tbilisi
3705411 i have the confirmation from prime minister hashim thaci i was appointed as a defense minister
3705412 i have been deeply concerned about the well being of thousands of civilians in georgia and the surrounding areas that have been caught up in this conflict
3705413 the two flights will provide more than 70 tons of aid supplies for up to 30 000 people and will augment other relief items already distributed by unhcr from its warehouses in georgia
3705414 all hands on deck women leading solutions for environmental sustainability
3705415 the conference is expected to give direction on how the co ordination of the work programmes of various institutions for women and youth within the environmental sector could be integrated and streamlined to maximise benefits and share resources
3705416 the conference will also bear testament to the progress that government and its stakeholders have made in ensuring that south african women take charge of the environment and are truly empowered to take environmental action

3705419 personally i have known the zimbabwean leadership for a long time
3705420 even if it means spending six months in zimbabwe then we will do it as long as it will bring an end to the challenges that the country is experiencing
3705421 let us give the zimbabwean leaders breathing space to resolve their differences
3705422 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
3705423 you have to make sure performance and the song is at the highest level it is a casting or it is a technical decision by the producer
3705424 two years ago eskom revised its electricity growth projection from 2 3 percent to 4 percent per annum
3705425 the upward revision of the electricity demand growth to 4 was required to align to governments target of a 6 percent gross domestic product growth between 2010 and 2014 and the kusile power station had to be brought forward as a result of the revised plan
3705426 in the next 18 months the construction of this new power station will create up to 5 000 jobs and will peak to 8 000
3705427 the economy has responded overwhelmingly to the interest rate hikes so far as there has been a significant slowdown in consumer demand such that households are under stress and the effects are evident
3705428 we believe the interest rate will remain unchanged because food prices are past their peak the rand shaky at times is steady and oil prices have also peaked
3705429 we believe it will remain unchanged but its going to be a close call it actually wouldnt surprise us if the reserve bank gives the interest rate one last hike
3705430 the rand has remained reasonably resilient and south africas trade deficit margin has narrowed whether this means south africa is exporting more or importing less we are not sure but the trade deficit margin has decreased
3705431 the inflation trajectory at the moment remains on the upside and the reserve bank could hike one more time to drive home the point that the revision of the cpix basket does not have such a great effect as inflationary pressures are still evident
3705432 we predict an unchanged repo rate because we have almost reached a peak in inflation the reserve bank has also achieved what it set out to do which was to cool consumer demand
3705433 although the reserve bank does not directly take the oil price into consideration the knock on it has on prices will definitely have an effect and the decline in oil prices will improve the economic environment
3705434 it brings into question whether the reserve bank would focus on the absolute inflation number or whether they would focus on the underlying inflation trend
3705435 a lower inflation number does not necessarily mean a less threatening upward inflation trend
3705436 guru aku sudah menuruti petunjukmu tetapi yang aku temui adalah sebuah jalan buntu aku tanyakan sekali lagi padamu yang manakah jalan menuju sukses kau jangan hanya menunjukkan jari saja tetapi bicaralah

3705448 deshalb soll jugendlichen mit dem projekt mut zur vielfalt eine kooperation zwischen der wiener jugendorganisation der gewerkschaft der privatangestellten druck journalismus papier gpa djp zara zivilcourage und antirassismusarbeit und der stadt wien ein tiefes verst ndnis f r gleichbehandlung und gleiche chancen vermittelt werden wir wollen ein friedliches miteinander eine gesellschaft ohne diskriminierung in welcher vielfalt als chance gesehen wird und hoffen mit diesem projekt hierzu einen beitrag zu leisten
3705449 der stadt wien ist es ein anliegen projekte die zum abbau von vorurteilen und die ein mehr an verst ndnis bringen entsprechend zu unterst tzen
3705450 der positive umgang mit vielfalt st rkt die sozialen kompetenzen der jugendlichen und ist somit eine bereicherung f r das gesellschaftliche miteinander das sich gerade in der arbeitswelt motivierend und produktiv niederschl gt
3705451 projekte wie diese sind uns sehr wichtig denn sie tragen zur pr vention bei damit jugendliche sich zu wehren wissen wenn sie mit diskriminierungen konfrontiert sind und dar ber hinaus einen positiven umgang mit vielfalt lernen
3705452 non so cosa ha in mente berlusconi quando azzarda queste previsioni spero che le sue parole riflettano la consapevolezza di doversi assumere piena responsabilit della situazione economica condividendola con le parti sociali finora la nostra classe dirigente ha saputo costruire solo uno schema di bipolarismo muscolare s impegnata in una costante ricerca della contrapposizione fine a se stessa evitando di misurarsi con il governo di processi abbandonati da anni ma quando si trascurano i problemi delleconomia poi si arriva alla guerra tra poveri oggi lo sport nazionale dare addosso a chi si trova in difficolt ci si accanisce perfino sui mendicanti vedo che in molti ambienti si lavora per un autunno caldo
3705453 se per questo lo va ripetendo dal primo giorno del nuovo governo io mantengo la stessa cautela adottata quando avevamo di fronte prodi anche allora la cgil voleva scendere in piazza e invece abbiamo avuto ragione noi perch poi laccordo sul welfare s fatto
3705454 io voglio stanare il governo capire cosa possiamo ottenere purtroppo c chi non offre mai una spinta per risolvere i problemi ma solo per denunciarli bisogna stare attenti altrimenti si d la sensazione di voler accendere dei fuochi di paglia in funzione politica anzich tutelare gli interessi dei lavoratori
3705455 non lo so io voglio che la detassazone del salario di produttivit diventi strutturale e che si superino i veti incrociati dei mille poteri allopera nel paese per raggiungere un accordo sulle priorit negli investimenti infrastrutturali giudicheremo su questo baster un briciolo di pazienza per capire quali sono le vere intenzioni del governo subito dopo lestate sar tutto chiaro
3705456 certamente noi non ci appiattiremmo su nessuno n sul governo n sulla confindustria
3705457 a me interessa lunit sindacale perch consente di dare pi forza alle istanze ma questa non pu trasformarsi in immobilismo la mobilitazione essenziale quando il governo non mantiene le promesse e rigetta ogni proposta ma un sindacato moderno deve saper costruire alleanze finalizzate alla soluzione dei problemi se dice sempre e solo no destinato a sparire quanto ai contratti dei commercianti e dei medici improprio parlare di accordi separati pi corretto dire che c un solo soggetto che non ha firmato la cgil
3705458 we just basically give him a little training and try to just keep him happy
3705459 thats my job im trying to think about my plan and are we on it
3705460 i think one of the reasons ive been able to be like this is because ive been there before
3705461 the people ive spoken with their views of the crop are certainly dramatically different than what these yields today say and what the conditions say theyre much more cautious and much more conservative
3705462 i talk to people who tell me about how bad their drowned out stalks are everyday
3705463 its important to note that most of that unexpected production gain was offset by higher demand and the fact usda pegged ethanol demand at 4 1 billion bushels this year infers to me there will be at least 4 5 billion bushels for the 2009 2010 campaign
3705464 obviously the usda has confirmed how nice the crop looks but in the final analysis we dont think the net yields can be that high
3705465 people are heading for the exits right now and asking questions later and when this ends grain prices should begin rising
3705466 we live in jackson heights our yards smell like fried onions
3705467 they come for the diversity and all the great food out here
3705468 they see it changing and gentrifying and they want to get in before it goes up and gets too well known lets call it a cheap but good date
3705469 i think most of the people who intended to vote in this election already voted
3705470 i dont think the turnout has been high enough to cause any
3705471 when youre talking about lines youre talking about ones that go around the block like we had in 2006 and i havent heard of any
3705472 our objective is to present a slice of mainstream america
3705473 its a terrific opportunity to let parts of the world that watch al jazeera see what democracy is like in a small town
3705474 when i saw the archway and the view of the rockies i knew golden was the right place
3705475 al jazeera is always going to evoke some raised eyebrows from folks who arent real familiar with their work since it isnt seen here
3705476 al jazeera is a legitimate news organization and we want those 120 million viewers to see that regular folks in the united states are great people and we have a lot of diversity in our population and our views
3705477 everybody in the world is going to be watching this convention so why not show golden
3705478 very upbeat people who believe in golden the clientele at the buffalo rose gets a little different
3705479 if my 17 year old son were drafted id be against it
3705480 this is an international broadcast and were trying to show the world that were decent happy people
3705481 so we welcome them they viewers can see what life in golden is all about and maybe they can decide not to hate us
3705482 al igual que nosotros el real madrid tambi n esta en fase de rodaje a n porque no llevamos ni un mes de pretemporada por lo que creo que va a ser una eliminatoria igualada f sicamente los equipos van a llegar bastante parejos al partido del domingo
3705483 estoy contento de haber jugado en mestalla porque es la primera vez que lo hago con la camiseta del valencia ya que la pasada temporada jugu aqu pero con la del getafe
3705484 poco a poco nos vamos compenetrando mejor y cogiendo los conceptos que quiere emery y eso es a base de partidos y minutos llevamos cuatro encuentros jugados y ahora tenemos una eliminatoria complicada con el real madrid con la supercopa que supone la disputa de un t tulo para tambi n nos sirve de preparaci n de cara a la liga
3705485 voy partido a partido y cada uno de ellos es complicado y muy importante porque aparte de por m estoy jugando por mi pa s y eso es una motivaci n extra por eso cuanto m s lejos llegue mejor aunque no logre medalla por eso estoy feliz por haber alcanzado los cuartos de final
3705486 es dif cil de explicar el cambio desde que llegu hasta ahora no se puede valorar es un cambio muy radical el primer d a no era valorable porque sufr a el cambio horario y cansancio con muchos partidos pero en competici n todo es distinto
3705487 la cabeza vuelve a estar en marcha en cuanto empiezan los partidos en los encuentros inconscientemente te preparas para competir mentalmente necesitaba un par n no entren muy bien pero cada d a me encontraba algo mejor y cuando empez la competici n ya me encontr mejor que cuando entrenaba los primeros d as me faltaba una semana
3705488 if the prime ministers economic advisory council pegs it economic growth at 7 7 per cent i can confidently say it will be close to 8 per cent
3705489 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3705490 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3705491 steve was actually really taken aback by it all because tom was tickled by the idea of partridges sports casual clothing
3705492 he kept coming up to steve and declaring im sports casual
3705493 how surreal must that be to have tom cruise announcing that to you in hollywood
3705494 to be fair tom did look a bit partridge in his jeans and blazer and seemed to be really happy to take the piss out of himself
3705495 he was really insistent that steve meet up with him for dinner soon
3705496 he suggested the london steve looked flattered but embarrassed by the attention
3705497 it was clear he is shy out of character whereas tom well isnt
3705498 several times i have heard of people attempting to get family photos copied at wal mart and refused because they were copyrighted because they were made by a photograph studio
3705499 at this hour the invading army of the russian federation has entered georgian territory outside the conflict zones of abkhazia and south ossetia
3705500 the georgian army is retreating to defend the capital the government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia and the further loss of life
3705501 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3705502 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3705503 there is evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3705504 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world
3705505 and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe it is time for russia to be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
3705506 offshore drilling whose issue is it anyway the peoples or the politicians
3705507 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3705508 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
3705509 our desire is to ensure that every stakeholder is content with arrangements and is comfortable with the icc champions trophy taking place in pakistan
3705510 we are committed to a safe and secure event in pakistan
3705511 we believe these visits and the feedback we get from them will play a major role in us achieving those ends
3705512 the flights are ongoing to redeploy the elements of the georgian contingent so that they can deal with the security issues in their country
3705513 if georgian officials request it we will facilitate the transfer within a relatively short amount of time
3705514 we have communicated with the russians what our obligations are

3705516 kerajaan begitu memahami kenaikan kos pengeluaran yang ditanggung oleh petani bagi mengelak beban yang ditanggung oleh golongan berkenaan kerajaan berusaha mewujudkan skim khusus bagi mengurangkan beban kos kepada pengusaha yang terbabit dalam pengeluaran makanan di negeri ini
3705517 sebagai contoh nelayan petani dan penternak diberikan insentif berdasarkan jumlah pengeluaran yang dihasilkan sama ada oleh pengusaha kecil sehingga ke tahap komersial
3705518 bayaran insentif boleh dibuat pada setiap hujung bulan dan usahawan terbabit boleh menuntut bayaran insentif setiap bulan atau mengumpulkan kuantiti hasil sehingga maksimum enam bulan
3705519 the deliberations centred towards taking a holistic view of security and a comprehensive action plan was drawn up with enhanced security at various embarkation points
3705520 ongcs endeavour and commitment is to ensure a secure and sufficient supply of energy availability to the billion population country security of the producing assets is a critical step towards this challenge
3705521 the two companies may also contemplate entering into a joint venture once they identify mining properties
3705522 we have made our point that high freight charges and ad valorem export duty on iron ore are hitting our margins it is now up to the government to decide whether we should seek higher price for our high quality iron ore from japanese and korean mills or not
3705523 if the agitation continues jammu and kashmirs economy will suffer a major jolt as investors that have committed over rs 5 000 crore worth of investment for 2008 09 would venture into neighbouring states of punjab haryana and himachal pradesh
3705524 both emerging and development markets are down with china and india having dropped the most developed countries by relatively less and commodity exporting countries like south africa brazil russia and soudi arabia the least
3705525 having lost one fifth to one third of their value equity assets would appear to have greater upside rather than down side prospects if there are no major further shocks a slow albeit hesitant recovery may be envisaged
3705526 you know ive just laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshiping here in beijing china you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion and i want to thank the pastor for his hospitality and i want to thank this beautiful choir for singing amazing grace and edelweiss it was a touching moment its been a joy to worship here again i want to thank you sir and god bless you god bless you
3705527 you want it exciting so theyll want to go there every day
3705528 hence they are prepared for the morning know what to expect and most important leave the house stress free and ready for school
3705529 every day was a bit different and it was what they were in the mood to eat
3705530 it made them responsible for themselves and taught them a bit about eating in a healthy manner best of all it made our crazy school mornings a bit more relaxed
3705531 everything for everyone in our family gets put on the kitchen calendar
3705532 its a very simple way to keep us all on the same page and not double booked
3705533 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3705534 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3705535 how is it you were totally incapacitated for those five days
3705536 can you explain how passengers or the captain were not aware of that
3705537 i must stress once again that the fabled theme of the languid adolescent girl has nothing whatsoever to do with sexual obsession except perhaps in the eye of the beholder
3705538 i paint angels all my feminine figures are angels apparitions people think it is eroticism which is perfectly absurd my painting is essentially and profoundly religious
3705539 peaches and max drummey are delighted to announce their very happy marriage
3705540 they did not want unnecessary publicity but following growing media speculation have decided to set out the facts
3705541 they looked very happy the bride looked very young and pale and quite angelic
3705542 it can be very crowded in the valley in the main place but the hermitages are a little bit removed from that
3705543 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3705544 we are not staying home with our children by default
3705545 my gut feeling is that players will be gearing their game towards the twenty20 format more than the five day format
3705546 the new generation of 15 to 20 year olds are they going to gear themselves towards travelling the world for nine months of the year playing five day cricket or earn plenty by playing three hour cricket a little bit in india and at home im not too sure
3705547 suppose youre a young player and you suddenly come into the england team now and within the first year you play two stanfords and earn a million quid and get an ipl deal
3705548 i cannot begin to understand why anyone would want to build an eyesore like this in their back garden
3705549 it is not in keeping with the properties in this area its like building an asda supermarket in the middle of a beauty spot
3705550 the gym is not my taste but my husband and two sons love it
3705551 white people think they know everything and they never tell you what they know
3705552 chelsea just so you know me and my boyfriend are getting married

3705561 the breach was caused by the town of rochesters negligence in failing to properly care for and maintain the dam in spite of several notification s from the state of new hampshire that the dam was in need of repairs and that if the sic rochester did not properly maintain the dam it would breach and cause landowners property damage
3705562 our first contention is that we are not at fault for the dam breaching and secondly that irregardless for who was at fault for the dam breaching were saying it was an act of nature because of the amount of water that came down
3705563 would not have made that much difference at her property
3705564 our contention is it was not the dam that caused it but in fact flooding conditions of the isinglass river
3705565 in term one active schools will be introducing cheerleading sessions to forres asg pupils participants will be coached in cheerleading which uses organised routines made from elements of dance jumps and cheers to keep fit be active and have fun

3705567 the iraqi soldiers are a good laugh and are always interested in speaking with you
3705568 when i got off the plane in kuwait it was like walking into an oven our training in kuwait covered basic infantry skills but was a lot harder for me due to the heat
3705569 well be working all week to ensure the town looks its best
3705570 however we are looking for some volunteers on wednesday evening for that last minute check anyone keen to help out should come along for 6 30pm with gloves and a plastic bag for rubbish
3705571 i really think the town is looking lovely and everyone has been doing a great job volunteers committee members and of course moray council in particular they are a superb crew
3705572 bear scotland who look after the trunk road through the town and gave us 500 to sponsor the bear sculpture in grant park have also been working hard on tidying up the a96
3705573 workmen have been spraying weeds on the traffic islands on the approach to the roundabouts at either end of the town and are going back to pull out the dead weeds this area has tended to let us down in the past so im hopeful it will impress the judges
3705574 the judges always like to look at the war memorial area but in recent years the boarded up shop on the corner has become a bit of an eyesore
3705575 we wrote to the owner mr lambert munro and asked if he or forres in bloom could do something to smarten it up he said it was still covered by a rental agreement but he offered to help us with paint and materials if forres in bloom wanted to do something
3705576 she was very keen to get involved in the project and got in touch with one of the centres volunteer artists jo smithson who volunteered her time and expertise as a donation and she is painting a mural on the side of the building
3705577 she is going to paint a peacock on the wall
3705578 she plans to paint the peacock on the door and continue the tail on the windows all round the shop
3705579 the peacock has a particular significance for forres in bloom as moray council continues to plant one out every year in grant park free of charge and it is nice that she is going to utilise that theme
3705580 now im looking forward to going round the town with the judges tomorrow
3705581 ah by bacchus with this aria i shall receive universal applause
3705582 donizetti when asked which of his own operas he thought the best spontaneously replied how can i say which
3705583 previous councils have accepted the recommendations and acted upon them
3705584 there are very few cases where he has made a ruling one way or another that hasnt been accepted
3705585 the loss of 15 houses from the removal of this site will require to be replaced in order to comply with structure plan housing land target for forres sites for 550 new houses must be found it is propsoed to do so by bringing forward land from the lochyhill long allocation
3705586 this area should never be built on it is a conservation area and should stay that way it is prone to flooding and lies on a real slope and i believe the only reason robertsons wanted to build houses on it is because the site will offer views across to findhorn im still worried that the findings will be overturned if the developers appeal
3705587 i dont think the road would have supported the extra traffic the new houses would have created
3705588 negotiations with sepa are continuing regarding the extent of flood risk to these sites
3705589 the disappointing bit was how we defended we were missing nathan sharp and john mutch so young bruce milne came straight in on his return from holiday and he had been suffering a bit with the flu during the week so it was a big ask for him
3705590 when they played long balls through the middle we were not decisive enough and not going for the ball and when it bounces as you know it starts giving the forwards a chance we actually looked more ropey in the second half which was disappointing because we had talked about that at half time and if anything it got worse after the break
3705591 the penalty deveronvales equalising goal came from us not clearing the ball properly we had the opportunity to get a foot through it but it remained in the box bruce then went in for a challenge and i thought he blocked the ball but the boy went down and the ref gave the penalty
3705592 the second goal really upset me and the team the ball was thrown down and it was still rolling when the free kick was taken so therefore it shouldnt have counted we got two booked for protesting and it was that goal which was decisive
3705593 they got a third one in the last two minutes of the game but at that point we had gone three up front and three at the back so we were a wee bit exposed but that was academic it was what happened at the first and second goal that really mattered
3705594 that was probably his best win for me hes an amazing horse and just keeps improving
3705595 im not sure what to do with him now but he could go to sydney for a hit and run mission
3705596 the shorts looks a suitable race but hes been up a long time and the difficulty will be keeping him going
3705597 i still think burdekin blues is the better horse but this bloke keeps improving and that surprises me
3705598 wed like to win some black type with her soon and melbourne is the best place to be right now with a host of fillies and mares races from september to october
3705599 shes run fourth twice in listed races in brisbane already and it would be nice to win some black type before she goes to stud

3705709 dass josef cap pl tzlich konstruktiv sein m chte indem er vp ideen bernimmt da h tten wir gleich ein paar vorschl ge wo die sp ihre ungewohnte konstruktivit t unter beweis stellen k nnte
3705710 die position caps ist umso interessanter als sich die sp mangels konstruktivit t ja selbst aus dem rennen genommen hat etwa bei der umsetzung des regierungsprogrammes oder jener punkte die sich sp und vp zu ostern dieses jahres auf initiative von vizekanzler molterer zur gemeinsamen abarbeitung vorgenommen haben von diesen 95 punkten sind wichtige offen geblieben etwa der schwerpunkt auf die st rkung der einflussnahme der wettbewerbsbeh rde oder die fokussierung auf die p dagogische unterst tzung und f rderung von kindern im vorschulalter die verfassungsreform mit der umsetzung der landesverwaltungsgerichte oder die evaluierung des strafrahmens bei sexualdelikten

3705713 wenn van der bellen diese wichtigen ideen nur als wahlkampfthemen abtut dann sollte er seine eigene europa politik hinterfragen
3705714 die sp unterscheidet sich in ihrer europapolitik fundamental von vp und fp w hrend die einen zu allem was aus br ssel kommt ja und amen sagen wollen die anderen in wirklichkeit den austritt aus der eu
3705715 aber es muss auch zul ssig sein dort verbesserungen zu fordern wo manche eu institutionen nicht einwandfrei funktionieren

3705722 die vp steht f r verbesserungen f r familien die vp schl gt daher vor zus tzlich den gratis kindergarten im letzten kindergartenjahr umzusetzen denn auch das ist eine zentrale ma nahme zur entlastung der familien wilhelm molterer hat mit den vp l nder bereits vergangene woche dar ber eine einigung sowie einen finanzierungsschl ssel vereinbart wenn die sp auch hier mitziehen m chte freuen wir uns dann erwarten wir aber auch dass faymann rasch die sp gef hrten l nder mit ins boot holt so wie dies wilhelm molterer mit den vp gef hrten l ndern bereits getan hat
3705723 die sp hat sichtlich keinen eigenen ideen f r die familien im gegenteil die sozialdemokraten haben bei den entlastungen f r familien immer blockiert bei der verm gensgrenze bei den doppelten pflegef rderungen oder beim aus f r erbschafts und schenkungssteuer und in jenen bereichen wo sie die m glichkeit h tte passiert berhaupt nichts beim von der vp geforderten sterreich ticket ist bis dato nichts passiert faymann ist hier unt tig

3705743 combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline
3705744 the good news was that the company reduced its equity exposure again proved resiliant in the credit crisis and the balance sheet remained strong
3705745 all of this volatility is usually the precursor to a large move

3705747 on 3 may 2006 a day after orlando stadium celebrated its 47th anniversary we stood at almost this exact spot when we handed her the old lady to the contractors
3705748 when we announced that orlando stadium would be demolished and reconstructed we had a vision of what the new stadium would look like and what it would mean to the community of greater orlando
3705749 the bus rapid transit brt system will run to the east of the stadium and rail transport will complement the brt on the western side public parking facilities will also be constructed around the stadium
3705750 orlando stadium will be completed on time within budget and without compromising quality as per the commitment we made when we handed it over to the developers in may 2006
3705751 the community at large has benefited from this development through the jobs that have been created

3705753 the question is how do insurers draw the line when the driver switches off the system do they switch it off legitimately because they are on their lunch hour or do they do it deliberately because they are about to commit a crime
3705754 other points of debate include the right for police or government agencies to ask for such data and how long the data should be kept if they ask for gps records from insurer because there is reason to believe a vehicle has been used for a crime
3705755 cost is directly linked to factors such as whether companies already have geodemographical systems in place and how they want to carry out integration

3705817 i have always performed in big sports events i dont know why this is maybe it is to do with the type of music i sing what it represents as it is very theatrical but yet it also has a very popular feel

3705819 for a long time the pop market never seemed to allow the beauty of a voice and said it belonged in the opera house or to musicals or somewhere else probably myself luciano pavarotti andrea bocelli our sort of group of people have forced the situation so that the pop market does now recognise beautiful voices also

3705823 all sorts of stuff my choice is really eclectic i have about 6 000 or 7 000 cds i wouldnt even like to go there

3705858 as my friends in tashkent and fergana told me almost everyone was equipped with thick sunglasses or burnt glasses that enabled them to watch the partial solar eclipse without harming their eyes maybe this was a result of the the governmental portal uzreports warning about the possible harms of observing the solar eclipse with naked eyes

3705923 many believed there wasnt any support whatsoever for our ballot initiative
3705924 the magnitude of the tax repeal is such that itll have a devastating impact on our states future
3705925 we need to recognize how bad things are a lot of families are just a few thousand dollars from losing their homes the tax refund money would go to pay off credit card debt student loans foreclosures this money could be used to pay for 4 50 a gallon gas
3705926 when the conditions are such that people are being squeezed as they are today in most every aspect of their lives the conditions are right to support something like this
3705927 businesses unless they profit from state government spending in some way are more inclined to set up shop in a state like texas with no income tax than they are in massachusetts
3705928 ending the income tax will create hundreds of new jobs it will stop the exodus of tax payers to other states and provide an opportunity for workers and businesses to stay in the state
3705929 they havent had an objective fact based study in their history
3705930 grounded in the principles of limited government fiscal responsibility and free markets
3705931 were citizens first and taxpayers first the fact that were union members means that we kind of understand that were all in this together we believe in collective bargaining and thats what government is
3705932 obviously police officers firefighters teachers and municipal employees all rely on taxes for their salaries and benefits
3705933 a parochial school gives a better education has a lower dropout rate but only spends 3 100 per year
3705934 big government often harms the very people that it is intended to help
3705935 it forces people to give up hard earned income to pay for wasteful bureaucracy
3705936 the impact that this would have on our states economy is frankly unknown
3705937 this is so sweeping this would create political and fiscal chaos
3705938 in simple terms this is 40 percent of your budget so every agency would sustain a 40 percent cut
3705939 unreasonable property taxes are the major reason why 37 percent of floridians are considering moving out of the state
3705940 by eliminating the income tax and destroying services or by raising property and sales taxes low and mild income residents suffer the most
3705941 the state spends 8 14 billion off budget this is the dirty little secret the state legislators dont want to talk about
3705942 if there was a corporation who engaged in these practices legislatures would call for hearings and transparency they ought to be doing the same thing with themselves taxpayers should be able to look and say oh this is being well spent thats how you get people involved and have practical democracy
3705943 everyone watched the state and local government with careful eyes
3705944 municipalities are already struggling to maintain their local budget rip out 40 percent of the state revenues they rely on and watch our schools and local services fall apart its really that simple
3705945 there isnt an enterprise in the world that has 40 percent frivolous waste
3705946 cities and towns get about 5 billion in various forms of state assistance
3705947 weve spent everything we have to date just to get on the ballot
3705948 the legislature doesnt get to vote on this the people do and i think people are going to choose schools and clean drinking water and parks that are clean and safe for our kids to play in
3705949 taxes are like the membership fee to society and as long as they are fair which they are people will understand that they get a lot in return

3706000 when he became leader of fife council he genuinely acted to the best of his ability to make things better for the people of fife and before his illness he worked hard for the people of central fife
3706001 while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humor and the familiar comfort of his voice
3706002 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3706003 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3706004 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3706005 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3706006 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3706007 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3706008 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3706009 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3706010 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3706011 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3706012 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3706013 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3706014 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3706015 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3706026 the images obtained from cctv are regularly used by police officers in their inquiries and there have been a number of crimes solved and perpetrators identified as a result
3706027 therefore cctv and the implementation of the other security measures put in place have led to ninewells being a safer place for patients visitors and staff alike
3706028 there is no doubt that criminals are aware of the security in place at the hospital and that the chance of them being caught is extremely high
3706029 i would ask that all patients visitors and staff take a few moments to think about their personal belongings while at the hospital
3706030 after all the criminal needs the opportunity deny them the opportunity and you have prevented a crime
3706031 the extensive cctv coverage in place means that people responsible for committing offences have been swiftly identified and brought to justice

3706044 brazos higher education service corp northstar education finance inc and the pennsylvania higher education assistance agency historically some of the largest issuers or obligors of tax exempt debt backed by student loans have suspended their ffel lending because they cannot secure crucial bridge loans that they need to participate in a new short term liquidity program run by the department of education their officials said specifically doe officials told lenders that once they tapped a line of credit and received bridge financing the lenders could disburse their student loans after which they would be eligible to borrow funds through the department once a week via a custodian but details of the program many of them technical remain unresolved and lenders say they have not had enough time to find any bridge lender comfortable with it

3706057 russia should not have attacked georgia especially georgia proper and some of its animosity toward georgia is clearly not noble but it is fascinating how the american establishment and media have portrayed this conflict as just another case of good vs evil with the u s ally georgia clearly in the right and moscow clearly in the wrong some accounts barely even take note of the proximate provocation behind russias attacks on august 8 after shelling south ossetias capital city tskhinvali georgia invaded

3706094 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3706095 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay

3706101 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3706102 realistic about the ability of cities such as manchester leeds and newcastle to regenerate struggling nearby towns such as liverpool bradford and sunderland
3706103 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible

3706155 penurunan harga pasir timah memang sudah terjadi dalam dua pekan lalu
3706156 pada bulan juli 2008 lalu harga pasir timah yang sudah dilobi basah dengan kadar sn 72 sebesar rp 106 000 per kg pekan lalu harga pasir timah dengan kadar sn yang sama turun menjadi rp 85 000 per kg sedangkan hari ini kemarin red harga semakin anjlok yaitu hanya rp rp 70 000 per kg
3706157 tentang penurunan harga itu kita sebagai mitra sudah diberitahukan oleh pt timah
3706158 bahkan harga pasir timah lobi sn 72 besok hari ini red akan turun lagi menjadi rp 65 000 per kg harga pasir timah itu bisa saja turun lagi pada harihari berikutnya
3706159 harga pasir timah dari ti di bawah harga lobi misalnya jika harga lobi sn 65 000 per kg maka harga pasir timah tanpa lobi di tingkat pemilik ti ratarata sekitar rp 55 000 atau dikurangi sekitar 10 persen karena diangab masih kotor
3706160 saya pikir bukan pengaruh dolar tapi memang karena permintan dunia yang turun yang jelas selama masa olimpiade inilah harga jatuh
3706161 saya sudah tahu hargah akan terus mengalami penurunan makanya saya langsung mempercepat target lobi agar bisa dijual sebelum harga jatuh lagi
3706162 misalnya kalau hari ini kita beli timah di ti harga rp 60 000 jika besok harinya harga turun menjadi rp 55 000 per kg maka kita pasti akan rugi sehinga terpaksa kolektor harus berhatihati bahkan banyak yang tak mau beli timah karena takut harga turun lagi karena jika gegabah bisabisa ngiret kaleng bangkrut red

3706194 take the chat off the screens and keep it on the laptops for the people who have seen mirrors and so forth and wont faint when confronted with more than one thing to do
3706195 there is no need for the court to use the privileges or immunities clause to apply the second amendment to the states it can find the second amendment to be incorporated in the due process clause just as it has done with the other provisions of the bill of rights
3706196 there is often no way for justices to decide constitutional cases without using their own views and ideology as a basis
3706197 designed to provide a framework for government across the centuries a framework that is flexible enough to meet modern needs
3706198 structural flexibility sufficient to adapt substantive laws and institutions to rapidly changing social economic and technological conditions
3706199 a living constitution that maximizes political discretion can be worse than no constitution at all it preserves the facade of constitutional legitimacy while unleashing the political forces that a constitution is meant to restrain
3706200 legislators should not be constitutionally barred from enacting the gun control laws they think necessary
3706201 we think d c should repeal its gun ban even though it is constitutional because it is bad public policy
3706202 a potent weapon against gun control laws across the board now appears largely wishful thinking by gun control opponents
3706203 from 1791 when the bill of rights was adopted until june 26 2008 not one law federal state or local was found to violate the second amendment
3706204 not one law has been declared unconstitutional on the basis of the free exercise clause
3706205 opposition to abortion rights his hostility to all forms of race conscious remedies his desire to allow school prayer and aid to parochial schools and his support of gun rights all come from a conservative political agenda not a method of constitutional interpretation
3706206 the only way to give meaning to both clauses is to conclude that the second amendment protects a right to have firearms only for purposes of militia service
3706207 has immediate and direct implications for the health and safety of others
3706208 state courts have universally rejected strict scrutiny or any heightened level of review in favor of a highly deferential reasonableness test that has been met by virtually every gun control law challenged in the state courts
3706209 as with the first amendments free speech right the second amendments personal right is subject to a range of reasonable restrictions even though strict scrutiny applies to the core of the protected conduct
3706210 subject to well understood historical exceptions and reasonable restrictions on time place and manner just as is the case with other constitutionally enumerated rights
3706211 this court should grant this petition to vindicate the rights of the petitioners and the thousands of other d c residents who seek nothing more than the ability to exercise their constitutionally guaranteed individual right to keep and bear arms
3706212 on january 6 1989 the district court ruled that the act allowed private persons who comply with the national firearms acts application and registration requirements to make and possess machine guns
3706213 just when i thought i was out they pull me back in
3706214 expressly declared that the second amendment was limited to safeguarding possession of firearms for militia service
3706215 a well managed blog being necessary to sustain a free society the right of the people to express their views on any subject shall not be infringed
3706216 since there are liberal law professors who agree with justice scalias view of the second amendment scalias opinion in heller must be as principled as the views of the liberal law professors
3706217 it cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect
3706218 existing research studies do not credibly demonstrate a causal relationship between the ownership of firearms and the causes or prevention of criminal violence or suicide
3706219 insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes
3706220 different rights have different purposes and run up against different sets of government and private interests

3706255 working through their mercenaries in south ossetia russia staged brutal provocations against georgia from late july onward last thursday georgias president finally had to act to defend his own people

3706257 we are delighted to have secured an order against mr angus having closely monitored his activities over the past few years

3706295 the culmination of 10 years of research and development and follows successful preclinical and human skin cell trials conducted in the laboratory
3706296 we believe vitrogro has the potential to save both lives and limbs and based on laboratory research to date to generate a strong global business for tissue therapies
3706297 using vitrogro could potentially help relieve some of these drastic personal clinical and financial impacts
3706298 imagine living with an ulcer and up to four layers of dressings or compression hosiery during the height of summer with pain reduced mobility and a reliance on carers and the health system for potentially up to six months or until your limb is amputated
3706299 vitrogro has the potential to significantly reduce healing times and improve patients quality of life through less pain regaining mobility and reducing the burden on others
3706300 our studies show that vitrogro will assist in the fast and effective treatment of ulcers by boosting the natural proteins in normal skin that encourage the proliferation and migration of healthy cells
3706301 if this is successful the new product could reduce the treatment time for thousands of patients with chronic wounds and would simultaneously cut treatment costs
3706302 while tissue therapies plans to focus on the application of vitrogro on the chronic ulcer market it also intends to continue with its burns application work
3706303 we had to stand up and be counted albeit in the second game of the season

3706305 to come and win 2 0 at a difficult venue then youre obviously pleased
3706306 its difficult to take because i think weve got a decent team here and i want to win every game i dont care who we play
3706307 i know there were lots of positives but the bottom line is we lost
3706308 we battled really hard i asked them for a big performance and theyve set themselves the standard now for the rest of the league campaign
3706309 there was some big performances out there against a top side we gave it a good go and thats all you can ask for
3706310 it was pleasing to score two goals because thats something weve been working on and its paid off

3706373 it is a matter of public record announced to the london stock exchange on 11 nov 2005 12 jan 2006 and 19 june 2006 and on our web site that we previously operated a number of public commercial services in the usa using the pagesense technology
3706374 we primarily partnered with emerging wi fi network service providers that wanted to partially or fully subsidize the costs of deploying their networks through advertising for example we worked with a free metropolitan wireless isp to serve session based contextual advertising to users that chose to access the internet via this free service we also partnered with a hotel wi fi provider and a number of others
3706375 the services were transparent to users and information such as how to opt out who provided the service and the privacy policy was easily accessible
3706376 for example each ad had a link that allowed users to find more information on opting out and the service this was a level of disclosure ahead of its time
3706377 if youre traveling through one of our airports or hotel chains or whatever and its offering free internet access in that first page theres a clear part that says we will give you targeted advertising while youre on this network
3706378 this is a free service so if you dont want targeted advertising you just say no to the free access
3706379 the images obtained from cctv are regularly used by police officers in their inquiries and there have been a number of crimes solved and perpetrators identified as a result
3706380 therefore cctv and the implementation of the other security measures put in place have led to ninewells being a safer place for patients visitors and staff alike
3706381 there is no doubt that criminals are aware of the security in place at the hospital and that the chance of them being caught is extremely high
3706382 i would ask that all patients visitors and staff take a few moments to think about their personal belongings while at the hospital
3706383 after all the criminal needs the opportunity deny them the opportunity and you have prevented a crime
3706384 the extensive cctv coverage in place means that people responsible for committing offences have been swiftly identified and brought to justice

3706401 her knowledge of technology goes a long way to addressing some of the concerns in the mccain campaign
3706402 she has an understanding of what it takes to maintain an edge in technology
3706403 we want to cultivate markets around the world and she has a good understanding of that
3706404 her experience at hp and her knowledge of the industry go a long way
3706405 i think she would actually force the administration to deal more aggressively with flaws in the american education system and enhance math and science learning at the k 12 levels
3706406 one of the keys to maintaining a competitive edge in technology is to develop educational institutions that can train the engineers who are capable of advancing existing products developing new ones and maintaining the competitive edge
3706407 hes using her as a visible outreach to hillary supporters
3706408 hes using her to show that he listens to female voters and that hes interested in courting those voters
3706409 the hillary clinton factor has made her a more attractive candidate
3706410 her addition to the ticket could provide mccain an opportunity to win over democrats particularly older women who were staunch supporters of hillary clinton
3706411 we can see her influence in how theyre using youtube
3706412 part of that is her influence and her understanding of technology theyre suddenly becoming aware of how important the internet is
3706413 shes not nuanced enough to know how to handle hot button issues like abortion
3706414 george bush has been in office for 7 1 2 years the first six the economy was fine a little over one year ago consumer confidence stood at a 2 1 2 year high regular gasoline sold for 2 19 a gallon the unemployment rate was 4 5 the dow jones hit a record high 14 000 americans were buying new cars taking cruises vacations on the high seas living large but americans wanted change so in 2006 they voted in a democratic congress amp yep we got change all right in the past year consumer confidence has plummeted gasoline is now over 4 a gallon amp hovering unemployment is up to 5 a 10 increase americans have seen their home equity drop by 12 trillion dollars amp prices still dropping 1 of american homes are in foreclosure as i write the dow is probing another low of 11 100 2 5 trillion dollars has evaporated from their stocks bonds amp mutual funds investment portfolios yep in 2006 america voted for change and we sure as hell got it now obama the dems candidate for president and the polls say hes gonna be the man claims hes gonna really give us change just how much more change do ya think you can stand
3706415 it was apparent that at peak traffic flow through the stores there was not enough staff we saw that there was a difference in the amount of conversions at peak if we increased the number of staff in the store at that time
3706416 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3706417 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users
3706418 if market participants accept as an article of faith that the federal reserve will bail them out it reinforces risk taking without the need for credit analysis as night follows day it is certain that in the absence of tremendous government regulation this bear sterns bailout will lead to a new and potentially bigger found of excessive risk taking
3706419 i wasnt that beat up just a little off in the head after the first dropedge im fine and will be back before the end of the year if i have any say in it
3706420 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3706421 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3706422 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3706423 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3706424 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3706425 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3706426 those who support the tradition say parents were free to decide whether they want to send their daughter to serve as kumari or not the girl gets state allowances and is looked after well
3706427 astrologers were consulting horoscopes of candidates from buddhist shakya families to replace the current kumari preeti shakya who is 11 and should retire during the annual hindu festival of dasain in october temple officials said
3706428 if we dont change her now well have to wait until next year which could be late
3706429 if the girl starts menstruating while serving as kumari it is considered inauspicious
3706430 ill just put this wherever and you can sort it out later
3706431 im never buying red goo from the store again emeril youre a geeeeeeeenius im sorry i blasphemed against you after that whole black forest hot mess damn this is tasty
3706432 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3706433 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3706434 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3706435 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3706436 i pictured myself on the top step but whether you win gold silver or bronze its the olympics its important
3706437 its a lifelong dream to get a medal at the olympics i fought really hard and in the end it paid off
3706438 at training camp in america everyone had to write what they wanted to win this year i said the tour of flanders and paris roubaix and larsson said he wanted to be olympic champion in the time trial
3706439 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3706440 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3706441 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3706442 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3706443 the increase in oil and commodity prices is damaging corporate profits
3706444 the fundamentals of the economy are much better than in the previous post bubble cycles
3706445 the downside risks remain elevated but we expect that this cyclical downturn will be a relatively mild one
3706446 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3706447 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3706448 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat
3706449 hagel couldnt keep his mouth shut long enough to be somebodys no 2
3706450 its tough to be someones no 2 when youre used to making your own decisions
3706451 its just not responsible to be saying things like that
3706452 we think richard hunter is the next voice of a generation like rush or hannity
3706453 the guys range is amazing he can talk everything from politics to mixed martial arts with expertise and passion and thats a rarity hes got a phenomenal rolodex and hes an amazing talent
3706454 improve the general climate and offer to the public the chance to have balanced perceptions on daily life mentally and emotionally
3706455 it is neither positive nor negative it simply reflects reality
3706456 i think its incredibly brave to be working flowers and leaves and petals
3706457 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3706458 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3706459 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3706460 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3706461 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3706462 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3706463 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3706464 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3706465 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3706466 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3706467 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3706468 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3706469 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3706470 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3706471 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3706472 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3706473 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3706474 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3706475 who are open to doing something on the production side
3706476 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3706477 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3706478 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3706479 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3706480 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

3706483 quero que esse governo se f porque nunca pensa no povo
3706484 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3706485 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3706486 all parties to the conflict reportedly continue to use and recruit children
3706487 cultural issues related to the concepts of boyhood and manhood
3706488 both armed groups and community members are being reported as perpetrators of such violations

3706495 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3706496 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3706497 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3706498 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3706499 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3706500 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3706501 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3706502 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3706503 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3706504 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3706505 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3706506 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3706507 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3706508 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3706509 theres palpable anger against the club and the way its being run
3706510 i think this is a sign of a greater malaise at the club theres a feeling that rangers are a bit of a rudderless ship and that this seems to happen consistently
3706511 the best players seem to go every saleable asset of the past decade has been sold
3706512 walter smith will be concentrating on getting players in and thats exactly what he needs to do
3706513 but theres no short term solution the fans are angry and even a couple of players being delivered before saturday isnt going to change that
3706514 you find out plenty about people when things arent going so well and weve certainly had a testing week
3706515 its time for our players to come up to the plate and stand up thats when you find out who is a rangers player
3706516 i feel you have to suffer disappointments to progress and our defeat to kaunas was a major major disappointment it was a body blow and how we come back from it is important
3706517 most strikingly the new forecasts show inflation falling slightly below its 2 target at the two year policy horizon and then well below it thereafter a rather lower medium term profile than expected in may
3706518 were probably still not looking at cuts coming through until 2009 becuase there are serious near term upside risks to inflation
3706519 in terms of impact on interest rates i think its a firm on hold until we see this sharp slowdown that they are expecting in growth start to impact on the inflation rate
3706520 while we would not rule out a cut in november particularly if the economy slows markedly further and oil prices continue to retreat we are maintaining our view that interest rates will stay at 5 00 until early 2009 however we then expect interest rates to come down markedly in 2009 to 4 25 by mid 2009 and to 3 75 by the fourth quarter of next year

3706529 whale encounter avoidance plan in place which includes instructions of what to do and how to report
3706530 weve been talking about grade inflation for the last 15 years everything is a superlative today its very difficult but in fairness to resorts it could be a five star experience because they expect you to be going out and be playing at the resort so the in room experience may not be where they are going to be putting their emphasis
3706531 ive personally been to this location and this is what they have and this is what the rooms looked like when i was there
3706532 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3706533 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3706534 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3706535 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3706536 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3706537 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3706538 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3706539 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3706540 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3706541 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3706542 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3706543 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3706544 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3706545 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3706546 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3706547 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3706548 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3706549 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3706550 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3706551 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3706552 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3706553 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3706554 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3706555 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3706556 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3706557 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3706558 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3706559 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3706560 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3706561 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3706562 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3706563 its always difficult to win the premier league its a hard slog and youve got to produce consistent performances and results and weve proven we can do it over a number of seasons
3706564 this season it will be as difficult as ever the teams at the top will be challenging very hard
3706565 weve obviously got to maintain our levels of consistency that weve had in the previous two seasons if we do that then weve got a great chance
3706566 we dont fear anybody but i think that arsenal chelsea and liverpool are all capable of winning the league
3706567 theyve got good enough players and sometimes its just down to a little bit of luck last minute goals injuries these are things that are not in your control
3706568 we have continued to make good progress towards resolving the plant issues that have significantly impacted our performance in the year to date

3706587 based on the belief that the best travel information is gained from other travelers rather than printed guidebooks that are only updated occasionally wikitravel is the ideal source for objective up to the minute travel information about locations around the world contributed by travelers who are currently there or have just been there
3706588 with the explosion in popularity of smartphones and other portable devices accessing wikitravel on the go is easier than ever before
3706589 we have community managers that monitor the site but they really dont have to do a lot of policing because the community takes care of it
3706590 world66 is an outlet for travelers to share their opinions on travel destinations users contribute personal travel anecdotes thoughts on accommodations and share recommended travel routes and must see sights
3706591 a five star rating system provides an instant summary of users opinions on hotels and restaurants

3706593 for eight years igougo has inspired passionate opinionated and truthful reviews from savvy travelers in short our high quality content is the real deal
3706594 even if you land on the site and read just a handful of igougo travel journals or reviews or see just a few of the photos in our galleries its hard not to come away inspired to go somewhere or do something
3706595 this passion for travel coupled with practical tips and reviews is why igougo remains such a popular and fun resource for trip planning and sharing

3706597 it has become a full fledged travel community where travelers from every corner of the globe can share their experiences photos and advice with other people that love to travel
3706598 because the travel wiki is part of our community its easier to find out more about the people writing the information
3706599 in a way the community provides accountability so the information is more reliable
3706600 we had a richer process and the product is better because of it
3706601 those who support the tradition say parents were free to decide whether they want to send their daughter to serve as kumari or not the girl gets state allowances and is looked after well
3706602 astrologers were consulting horoscopes of candidates from buddhist shakya families to replace the current kumari preeti shakya who is 11 and should retire during the annual hindu festival of dasain in october temple officials said
3706603 if we dont change her now well have to wait until next year which could be late
3706604 if the girl starts menstruating while serving as kumari it is considered inauspicious
3706605 when the iphone came out we were excited about the big screen the graphics chip and the good components
3706606 we thought it was an opportunity too big to pass up
3706607 i showed it to my 92 year old grandmother who never used a mobile phone or the internet and she immediately understood the game
3706608 we have a lot of interest to do free branded iphone applications
3706609 marketers were hesitant initially they did not understand what applications would be popular or what the market would be
3706610 but now there are a lot of opportunities advertisers and agencies see this as a chance to develop original branded content
3706611 they realize there is a great opportunity in branded applications theyre not just boring banner ads
3706612 whats interesting about web 2 0 is that it gives you access to markets a small business owner couldnt normally reach
3706613 in the 17 years ive been breeding dogs ive never been as far as i am now with my business since building the blog site
3706614 now ive got waiting lists for puppies in fact as soon as the blog was up i started getting calls
3706615 any small business owner can use a blog as an online marketing tool but its more effective to combine it with google adwords to drive traffic a lot of professionals such as massage therapists and restaurateurs are also combining google adwords with online scheduling services and seeing an enormous increase in revenues
3706616 its easy to start a blog but its another to create an environment thats engaging enough to be an impactful part of your business
3706617 your efforts must be driven by core business needs and tightly aligning them with specific tactics
3706618 theyve taken the drivers seat by becoming the early adopters
3706619 thats because web 2 0 enables them to achieve a scale at an affordable price which was never possible before
3706620 if you can identify and reach out to influencers on a one on one basis it can be very fruitful with 100 million consumers actively reaching blogs businesses need to know the right place to get to the right audience with the right message at the right time
3706621 once youve done your flight planning then you can start doing outreach
3706622 there are a gazillion sites out there so you need to find your audience for a small business where you have to wear many hats its helpful to have a way to find the major influencers and prioritize your marketing it helps you gauge what people are talking about who is talking and what you need to watch out for
3706623 virtual merchandise just gives you a different way to connect with consumers and pilot new merchandise without having to go to the expense of making real goods
3706624 in the true smal business fashion we dont have funds we wanted to reach our demographic so we have to look to non traditional media channels
3706625 we saw there com as a very interesting social test to see what kind of reaction we would get to our new designs and over two years wed only have to sell 20 to 30 t shirts for the investment to pay for itself weve definitely hit that number already
3706626 you can tap into customers you can compete and innovate efficiently and effectively you can integrate blogs forums wikis and rss really simple syndication feeds to support activities that are unique to your products and ideas
3706627 excuse me can you please get someone else to ring

3706629 i know its serious when you decide to go to the doctor
3706630 thank you for putting into words the horror of the swedish daycare system that breaks the spirits of so many young children and denies them their parents for most of their waking nbsp hours it is so hard to stand up to jante and claim the right to rear your own children in this society and the social pressures against choosing to be a stay at home parent are enormous and hard to resist my husband and i are both fiercely determined to bring up our 3 yearold son at home and not put him in dagis and we pay the price everyday financially and socially the dream of emigrating to a more family and child friendly country lives on but wonderful family and friends keep us here to me as the full time mother the glories of seeing our son develop into a beautiful human being with an unbroken and free spirit outweighs the price many times over but the feeling of loneliness in our choice and the social stigmatization is sometimes almost too much to bear and thats when reading a posting like this one really lifts me up and gives me the strength to keep fighting for what we believe in so thanks again jenny m rdell

3706640 my gut feeling is that players will be gearing their game towards the twenty20 format more than the five day format
3706641 the new generation of 15 20 year olds are they going to gear themselves towards travelling the world for nine months of the year playing five day cricket or earn plenty by playing three hour cricket a little bit in india and at home im not too sure
3706642 suppose youre a young player and you suddenly come into the england team now and within the first year you play two stanfords and earn a million quid and get an ipl deal wheres it going to go to
3706643 thats my fear for the longer format that the motivation of players will be more geared towards twenty20 cricket
3706644 my fear is that in other teams that have so many kolpaks pressurised situations bowling at the death bowling with the new ball captaincy batting under pressure are being done by too many kolpak players which is not going to develop england players

3706663 i was standing in the lobby at mccuff when the inventor of the motorcycle cuff al castro said we have this great product but no money to market it
3706664 the cuff has done extraordinarily well it could eclipse the entire company
3706665 my philosophy is simple i like the world of music and there i think global because you have to let
3706666 if someone were to call me and talk to me someone who had been through it all and made it back and is doing well it probably would have meant a lot
3706667 just hearing those words of encouragement and whether its one month or two months the more time he gets under his belt the better hes going to feel thats where we can relate as to how we felt at that time
3706668 a man who enjoys the finer things in life like rocking his polo polos and khaki shorts imported brew in hand
3706669 is an arizona boy who was repeatedly bitten by poisonous snakes and scorpions in his early years and has obviously never fully recovered
3706670 is well known in the community because if people dont know who he is he tells them forcefully
3706671 its a soggy mess but its the only way to make sure that guillermo eats the most important meal of the day
3706672 gino padula im not sure he must train in the evenings but seriously gino came in with a bit of a roar and then has hit some speed bumps with injuries hes got lovely hair his english is decent which is good so he can understand all of the rude spanish i am saying to him hes a really good guy although i am a little disturbed about his mafia connections i think guillermo brought him in so they could start a little argentine mafia in the locker room i think nico hernandez was involved too but then he disappeared were all concerned that nico may have wronged gino or guillermo in some way and then the mafia got him you have to be careful around those guys ive probably said too much
3706673 big andy where do you start hes an englishman who is desperate and i mean desperate to be a california boy apart from the fact that he sticks out like a sore thumb because hes seven foot and has an english accent everything else about him is completely californian its hard to explain whats going on in his head sometimes its so high up there that ill never have a chance to get a good look inside anyway g i is what we call him generation iro hes in his own world and i think hes on some sort of international wealth plan hes sewing his own cleats because he doesnt want the shoe companies telling him what to do he does what ever g i wants to do like sometimes talking in the third person
3706674 bc that little rat obviously bc has been around the league a while hes a very sneaky little man you think hes a shy and quiet 12 year old boy lookalike but underneath that lovely image is a little raging rat thats ready to break out ok he really is a great guy and all joking aside when his playing days are done i really do think he has an excellent future as a decoy on that dateline nbc show
3706675 manu loves the geese he is fascinated i had to have a conversation with him about the geese because he is fascinated by all of the geese around columbus and he didnt understand that there was no owner to all these geese ive seen manu try to herd some of them at obetz so if all of the geese disappear from the streets and ponds of columbus and are being farmed somewhere i think well know exactly who the farmer is manu is a lovely man and were glad hes on our team
3706676 kenny came in and thought he was a field player he did the beep test and scored a 412 which is unheard of as a goalie hes a madman around the goal box sometimes we play a crossing and finishing game at the end of practice for a little bit of fun and kennys out there trying to punch peoples heads off their shoulders hes not the type of guy youd ever want to wrong thats because he has to get you back 400 times worse or hell never be satisfied ive played the odd trick on him and hes always come back with anger i think he has a lot of pent up anger hes ready to explode at any time as a warning to fans out there dont ever play a trick on kenny schoeni if you do that whats that spot on your shirt trick to him hes likely to rip out your jugular with his bare hands
3706677 ryan is a notre dame boy so he is a smart and sophisticated young man hes a quiet guy who keeps to himself or hangs out with the other young guys i think there might be some deviousness going on there with those boys because they gather together in a dark corner of the locker room and talk amongst themselves i dont know if maybe theyve been recruited by the argentine mafia as low level peddlers who do business in the dark corners of the locker room or what but that group of miller george josten and kevin burns i think kevin is the mule who does all of the dirty work hauling questionable weightlifting supplements to danny orourke i think thats how that group makes most of their money so miller is part of the young group that moves protein powder from the argentine mafia to danny orourke
3706678 i think hes gone ahead and decided that hes not going to shave until hes back playing again so he looks like a caveman at this point hes got a longer thicker beard he grows it quickly and right now he looks like the episode of family guy when peter griffin had birds living in his beard thats adam moffat right now and its only been a month i hate to think of what its going to look like in four months goodness by then maybe one of manus geese will be living in his beard that would be lovely
3706679 hes one of those devious boys in the dark corner of the locker room george is a quiet lad as well but hes got that miller burns connection going on he seems like a nice kid but theres a devious side due to his connections to the argentine mafia i think its a shame that the mafia got to those kids first instead of the nice folks like myself for instance but george tells a decent joke now and then and hes quick witted ive been working on getting some dirt on him and ryan miller so maybe i need to go undercover and hide in the corner of the locker room
3706680 cory knows a new zealand guy that i know and i think it rubbed off on him during college he has a bit of new zealand wit if you get to know him theres a real sharp wit ticking in his head so i think there could be good times ahead with cory
3706681 no he doesnt eat vegemite he hasnt gone that far new zealand i hear hes a big fan of ginger though
3706682 as we discussed kevin is a mule for the argentine mafia i think thats why he has faked an injury it allows him to earn good money running supplements from the argentine mafia to danny orourke the only time kevin shows up at training is on food days every time i see him in line hes got handfuls of food that he is stuffing into his mouth i cant tell if its because hes really hungry from working crazy hours for the argentine mafia and making all those night runs for them or if its because miller and josten ate all the food back at their house it has to be something though because hes always double fisting chicken and whatever else he can get his hands on its really weird
3706683 hes the super sub as some people have called him
3706684 he has long loping arms so sometimes if youre anywhere near the same room as him you can take an inadvertent elbow to the face or a hand to the back of the head without warning because his arms are flailing all over the place id hate to be the opposition going against him in a game ive done it in training and i get black eyes my nose becomes swollen even more so than normal its a nightmare
3706685 steve can be seen driving his big truck around town like hes still back in cali
3706686 well i dont know what theyre called guys called him cabbage patch kid and i just went with it i never had one unlike you sirk so i dont know all the dolls names youre a weird guy im done with this interview get away from me

3706689 wenn abbuchungen stattgefunden haben muss ja vorher etwas passiert sein

3706693 will demonstrate new technologies for formation flying and rendezvous i e close encounters and interaction between space vehicles
3706694 when that really takes off itll be a good day for us i think one of the stifling factors at the moment for the mobile industry is that the operators are controlling the decks and theyre not necessarily the best people to sell games
3706695 with a better community aspect it allows the best games to stand out and take the number one slot so the quicker that happens the better for the industry whether it will succeed or not we dont know yet
3706696 were quite positive about the iphone and n gage platform because we try and push the technology as far as we can put as much into the games as possible for the device these new devices with extra features allow us to really let our imagination go
3706697 but at the same time they dont require massive assets to build so were not bogged down by them were working with the iphone sdk and because of the nature of the high end phones right now theyre getting very close to the likes of the nintendo ds
3706698 in this industry you have to have reliable up to date daily news and information gamesindustry biz is by far the best source for the games industry its grown in stature over the years and really is the pre eminent site its a highly effective way to market to the trade i recommend it highly

3706725 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3706726 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3706727 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3706728 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3706729 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3706730 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3706731 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3706732 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3706733 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3706734 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3706735 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3706736 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3706737 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3706738 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3706739 i hope the british board of film classification bbfc will view this with concern and decide it should not be granted a classification
3706740 what the rest of world does is up to them

3706742 it seems a shame that the games manufacturer have decided to exclusively release this game on the wii
3706743 mediawatch uk is a collective of grumpy old men and frumpy old women singularly dedicated to spoiling the fun of the rest of the british population for members of the bigoted right wing press who are having trouble making up enough anti gypsy and anti asylum seeker stories to fill their pages our press page contains a wide range of outraged and reactionary stories that you can seize on to
3706744 we heard loud and clear today how much people care about their gmail accounts

3706998 we have been renting apartments across cork for close to a decade now and we have never seen the market this buoyant when we noticed the house prices in cork dropping many of the property investors we work with became alarmed at how their investments would fair what they have found is a property market that is not on its knees as many of the doomsayers had been predicting but one that is thriving as apartment rental prices steadily grow through an ever increasing demand for apartments to rent in cork amp ireland
3706999 at platinum property we ourselves have been a little surprised at this trend whilst we knew that there would be more demand for apartments to rent in cork city we didnt expect there to be this level of demand and that has prompted a number of small and big property investors to purchase more properties across cork
3707000 we too are fans of these shows and have noticed that many of the viewers we have been speaking with are taking this opportunity after previously being too cautious or unwilling to make the move these investors do not have much market knowledge but have recognized that property prices will begin to rise again sooner rather than later and that acting now will give them a greater return when they sell in a year or two and a steady rental income in the meantime

3707025 i see no humor in making fun of anyone with a mental or physical disability
3707026 this is a disgustingly low portrayal of citizens who go through stares laughing and taunting on a daily basis dreamworks and mr stiller are choosing to hide behind their taunting under the auspices of comedic creativity when they are clearly stooping down to the schoolyard bully mentality and finding humor in mocking someone who cannot fight back as a society i keep hoping that we have at least moved forward and educated ourselves to have a modicum of compassion for those who are less fortunate than ourselves however it is clear that mr stillers writing team and the executives at dreamworks have never had to defend a sibling cousin or relative from verbal threats taunting and name calling with this film they are in fact those who are delivering those insults while asking the general public to pay and laugh with them the public should refuse to stoop so low

3707029 her performance in march april and may to june 3 was literally miraculous
3707030 im very grateful actually personally that i had a chance to get out and see so much of america because her only option after she lost all those caucuses in february and knew she was going to be outspent was to raise this incredible grassroots campaign and chelsea made 450 appearances for her mother in the last three months alone i went to 350 different communities i got to see parts of america i never saw when i was running or serving and it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life
3707031 my whole theory about climate change is that the biggest problem in aggregate is the fact that india and china are about to pass the us in emissions and no country is going to agree to remain poor in order to avert climate change
3707032 i think it is really important that the vast mass of countries that are developing find ways to skip the carbon stage of economic development ways that accelerate rather than undermine their wellbeing
3707033 i think that the united states does need to pass climate change legislation we need to put a price on carbon we need to set up a capping trade system and one that cant be cheated on i agree with all that but when people say that most loudly they are usually looking for an excuse to do nothing and if we burn up the planet then no one will give you laurels for having come up with the best available excuse to do nothing your grandchildren wont be proud of you and we may have an irreversible situation
3707034 secondly because all these developing countries have to be worried about the problems at hand feeding the people that are there educating them providing basic healthcare having some near term economic strategy i think that people like me who care about this stuff have to find economically attractive options for them
3707035 some former communist countries that prior to 1990 were running very very dirty carbon based inefficient industrial economies
3707036 the biggest problem with kyoto was the united states bugged out on it so it gave everybody an excuse to take a bath

3707038 i just try to figure it out and i try to get other smart people around who figure out how to do this because i was so struck by all these countries that wont meet their kyoto targets
3707039 one reason i went to that little village today is that that little village is now organised for tomorrow ill go home now and ill be able to tell people that i went to the highlands of ethiopia and saw a classroom with two led lights nobody will believe that and that it works economically for them
3707040 i just want very much the country to change course
3707041 i want us to be on a different economic course a different social policy course a different course in the world and were going to do what we can to be helpful

3707091 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3707092 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3707093 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in

3707119 the doha round of world trade organization negotiations can still be concluded by the year end deadline despite the collapse of talks last month in geneva wto chief pascal lamy said in new delhi
3707120 echoing his optimism indian commerce minister kamal nath said his country is keen to resume the talks and complete the round the geneva talks werent a failure but a pause and hope that the talks will go forward said mr nath who emerged as one of the dominant negotiators in the talks
3707121 the latest talks in geneva collapsed after the u s couldnt reach an agreement with china and india on developing countries ability to impose emergency tariffs on agricultural products to protect farmers from a sudden increase in imports
3707122 let me give you another example if the round is concluded with success the us could see the amount of trade distorting subsidies reduced to
3707123 commerce and industry minister kamal nath who was sharing the dais with lamy at a cuts ficci conference on global development goals said
3707124 otherwise a renewed attempt being made by lamy and others to bring the talks back on rail could meet the fate of the recently abandoned talks in geneva
3707125 nath was responding to lamys remarks that if wto cannot reach a deal the us agricultural trade distorting subsidies could see a sharp jump to over 48 billion a year from ceiling of 14 5 billion which the bush administration had offered at the geneva mini ministerial meeting
3707126 if the round was not to conclude the us will be able to spend much more on subsidies lamy said
3707127 president george w bush still thinks a world trade deal is possible despite a major setback last month and will continue pushing to get one u s agriculture secretary ed schafer said on tuesday
3707128 i was with president bush when we received word that there was an impasse and his immediate response was its not over yet its not over yet we can still do it schafer told reuters reporters and editors in an interview
3707129 im probably getting in trouble for talking about bushs comments in a private meeting but that was his response and that was his charge schafer said
3707130 even if that issue had been resolved other potential deal breakers lurked on the horizon
3707131 schafer who did not attend the geneva meeting brushed aside the suggestion the united states prolonged discussions on the special safeguard mechanism to avoid dealing the politically sensitive issue of cotton
3707132 ive never heard that in our briefings including the one for bush just before the team went to geneva he said
3707133 u s trade representative susan schwab offered early in the geneva meeting to cap overall u s spending on trade distorting farm subsidies at 15 billion down from an
3707134 she then tentatively accepted a compromise that would have capped u s trade distorting farm subsidies at 14 5 billion but faced pressure from india and many other developing countries for even deeper cuts
3707135 if were going to remove the safety net from american producers we are going to balance that with giving them more economic opportunity through increased exports he said
3707136 if we have free access to rest of the world maybe we can talk about reducing that cap a little bit
3707137 the former north dakota governor also said the united states might be willing to phase out or eliminate the u s tariff on ethanol as brazil has been seeking in the doha deal
3707138 brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva tuesday urged indian prime minister manmohan singh to help complete the doha round in the interest of reducing agricultural protectionism and promoting expanded market access for farm goods
3707139 in a 20 minute telephone call to singh tuesday morning lula lamented the failure of the latest world trade organization negotiations in geneva and urged singh to help conclude the talks before the end of the year
3707140 we swam an entire ocean in the doha talks only to drown as we were reaching the beach lula said according to sources at the brazilian presidential office
3707141 india china and other emerging market nations refused to sign onto an agreement in the doha round last month following an impasse with the u
3707142 in the conversation tuesday singh reportedly told lula that india had the duty to take into consideration its 600 million subsistence farmers and said that there was a huge distance between the minimum needs of india and what was proposed in the doha talks
3707143 president luiz inacio lula da silva says there is a small chance of reviving the failed doha round of talks under the world trade organization
3707144 on 12 august 2008 ambassador don stephenson chairperson of the non agricultural market access nama negotiating group circulated a report on the latest developments in the talks particularly the outcome of the 10 days of the july 2008 package this was when ministers came to geneva from 21 to 30 july to try to agree on modalities a sort of blueprint for the final deal in agriculture and non agricultural market access although they failed to agree on the complete package gaps were narrowed on several issues
3707145 after a worrisome start to the growing season that fanned fears of food shortages and huge economic losses
3707146 the department of agriculture is forecasting the second highest corn yield on record with production of 12 3 billion bushels about 600 million bushels more than it had expected earlier in the summer
3707147 as cool weather in april and downpours in may gave way to widespread flooding in june prospects seemed miserable for corn
3707148 many farmers had to replant their washed out fields some ran out of time to do so food industry groups went to battle with ethanol interests saying there was not enough corn for both food and fuel corn futures prices soared to an unheard of 8 a bushel triple the price of a few years ago
3707149 some analysts worried that 9 or even 10 a bushel was possible that price would probably have been ruinous to livestock producers and ethanol plants alike although corn farmers would have been in clover
3707150 the highest corn yield on record was 160 4 bushels an acre in 2004 the new 2008 estimate of 155 bushels is up 3 9 bushels from last years harvest total production will be lower than last years bumper crop because farmers planted fewer acres of corn
3707151 corn prices which have been falling for weeks settled tuesday at 4 40 to 5 40 per bushel down 70 cents per bushel on both ends of the range
3707152 the soybean crop is slightly more of a question mark since it was planted even later than corn the government is forecasting a harvest of 2 97 billion bushels down about 30 million bushels from its earlier forecasts but that is much better than many had expected in june
3707153 soybean futures have also fallen back although not as much as corn at the beginning of july they exceeded 16 a bushel on tuesday they settled at 12 14
3707154 the u s season average soybean price for 2008 09 is projected at 11 50 to 13 00 down 50 cents on both ends of the range
3707155 the all wheat season average farm price is projected at 6 50 to 8 00 per bushel down 25 cents on each end of the range from last month
3707156 the august forecasts of corn and soybean production were close enough to market expectations that a large price reaction is not expected
3707157 as recently as 10 years ago a bumper crop of corn was welcome news for farmers and consumers alike the farmers would have more bushels to sell which would drop prices for those buying eggs steak and turkey at the grocery store
3707158 but in the era of ethanol even the extraordinary harvest predicted tuesday by the government will likely provide little relief from the pressure of high prices which hangs over growers food producers and consumers like a scarecrow
3707159 with ethanol expected to consume more than 30 percent of that harvest the economy has embarked on a new cycle in which bumper yields instantly find new buyers the prices stay higher and farmers face greater expenses for land and fertilizer causing them to respond by continuing to plant more corn
3707160 a decline in corn prices does not necessarily translate into savings in the check out line since many food companies would be reluctant to slash prices
3707161 i think they are telling investors that in the long term the days of 2 a bushel corn are behind us said matt arnold an analyst for edward jones
3707162 high crop prices and favorable weather are triggering bigger harvests world wide but grocery shoppers probably wont see much relief anytime soon
3707163 but global demand for grain is rising so quickly that even bumper harvests cant puncture the two year old grain price rally that has been inflating retail food prices
3707164 while corn futures prices have cooled from the 7 level that was hit in june when flooding sparked fears of widespread crop damage the usda price forecast means that food executives and livestock producers can expect to pay twice as much for corn in the foreseeable future as they did for much of the previous decade
3707165 demand for grain is strong in part because economic growth in the developing world is giving hundreds of millions of people the means to afford richer diets including meat milk and eggs from grain fed livestock
3707166 high oil prices on top of government mandates meanwhile are stoking production of corn derived ethanol fuel
3707167 corn has taken an increasing role in the national economy in recent years because of its dual role as a source for auto fuel and its ubiquitous use in the food industry the grain is the major feed source for livestock and is an ingredient in foods as disparate as yogurt soda cereals and ketchup corn is also a major export item
3707168 in its first estimates this year based on field visits and farmer surveys the u s department of agriculture sharply raised its estimate tuesday of corn production and said nearly ideal weather has helped midwestern farmers recover from junes devastating floods
3707169 that recovery eventually may lead to lower prices for corn and soybeans which in turn could provide some relief to meat producers who use the grains for animal feed
3707170 it wont happen soon though even with the usdas current projections and an easing in grain prices recently prices of many crops are double what they were a year ago
3707171 ephraim leibthe a usda economist said in an interview with ap radio that food inflation could drop from its current 5 percent rate
3707172 were entering harvest season and prices are pulling back iowa state university extension economist chad hart said an early frost is a concern and if that looks like it could happen then the markets might truck back up
3707173 hart said commodity markets also will be influenced by the price of a barrel of oil and the value of the u s dollar
3707174 the international energy agency said the tight global oil supplies that have driven crude prices to record highs this year are easing but cautioned that strong oil consumption in china and geopolitical factors still threaten to tighten markets in coming months
3707175 with u s and european consumers reducing consumption and the organization of petroleum exporting countries and other producers pumping more crude
3707176 in terms of oil fundamentals crude and product supply tightness has eased the paris based iea said adding that the global oil market still faces challenges
3707177 we continue to stress the supply uncertainty thats out there the events over the past week in georgia and turkey have only reconfirmed that said iea supply analyst david fyfe an oil pipeline blast in turkey last week shut at least 500 000 barrels a day of production also fighting erupted between russia and georgia a major oil transit country

3707182 this is a business matter that my son cory is working through with his attorney i have no involvement in his company
3707183 we believe that the younger ruppersberger was the sole proprietor of these businesses

3707185 the majority of our cases deal with hundreds or thousands of calls
3707186 contact clients that arent being reached by other telemarketing lists because of dnc do not call scrubbing
3707187 it is my understanding that this particular company is on the federal trade commission list of major violators

3707189 china is very very keen to join the world community the world community has more responsibility to bring china into the mainstream of world democracy

3707191 one big problem is fear it is a sign of weakness
3707192 but you cannot hide from the rest of the world a closed society has no future it is in chinas own interest
3707193 chinas position on tibet related issues is clear and persistent there is no change in that

3707357 the evidence shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3707358 it was just so cruel and unthinking and so wrong because there is nothing you can do to prevent yourself being raped it is not illegal to go out and have a drink it is illegal to rape somebody
3707359 it was immoral my immediate reaction was there has got to be some way to fight this
3707360 it used to be that they were always blamed if they were wearing a short skirt today its that they were drinking
3707361 its very important for women whove been victims of rape to get compensation because often its the only acknowledgement you are going to get that you have been a victim of crime given that the conviction rate in this country is only 6
3707362 we have just completed a review of our staff instructions operating procedures and structure to ensure greater consistency in decision making
3707363 reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3707364 it is vital the cica understands that women are not responsible for mens criminality because they have a drink or for any other reason
3707365 nobody would suggest that if someones wallet was stolen after having a drink then their compensation should be reduced
3707366 as far as we in the government are concerned a victim of rape is not in any way at all culpable due to alcohol consumption
3707367 as i understand it the cica have accepted that the guidelines were being misapplied i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases that they believe may also have had the guidelines misinterpreted and review them without the victims themselves having to go back and ask for that review
3707368 if an applicant accepts our decision then that case is finalised and closed
3707369 if they wish to ask for a review they must do this themselves in writing
3707370 contributed to the circumstances which gave rise to the injury
3707371 old prejudices like if a woman is wearing a short skirt or acting in a certain way are still operational
3707372 by reducing compensation because a woman has been drinking the cica is operating under those old prejudices
3707373 the scheme was originally applied wrongly in this case but this was corrected at review and the award was paid in full
3707374 it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption this supports our view that a victim of rape is not in anyway culpable due to alcohol consumption
3707375 a victim of rape should not have any compensation reduced because of their drinking i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases

3707512 i guess it was just a little bit too hard to get out of that funk it affected me on floor a little bit
3707513 i was just really eager to do my routine and get the show on the road but they did hold me for quite some time and i guess i lost my nerve a little bit
3707514 his incident was an accident he fell from a building
3707515 it was a long wait for one race and the conditions were very light
3707516 in those conditions anything could have happened so im pretty relieved to have come away with a good result
3707517 i was really fortunate to get seventh in that race i was sixth of seventh at the first windward mark and just had a disastrous downwind at the bottom mark i was 15 or something like that it all went wrong
3707518 i just had to calm myself down on the second upwind and went out to the right of the fleet and i got some wind pressure and was able to get back i had to do something to get back into the race
3707519 there are three more races probably and the medal race which counts double so i have to keep trying hard
3707520 we were prepared to sit around a lot here it was just all part of the plan
3707521 we tried to stay cool and then really focused in when the time came
3707522 and to win a medal its just indescribable i cant tell you how proud i am
3707523 any time we can get a u s athlete on the podium it just helps the sport in general and hopefully motivates others at home that they can do it as well were role models for the sport of cycling which is important in america and its really special to have two of us on the podium i cant wait to celebrate with him tonight
3707524 it was great to see i know how hard shes worked
3707525 i knew i shouldnt be sitting down on the ground but i just needed to stop for a second and collect my thoughts catch my breath get some water down there were three or four of us really battling there for third place its a big relief its a great feeling
3707526 its better to ask the italians how did they perform in this match

3707561 it was a large large quantity far too much to put in a police car we had to call a van it was in the best condition i have ever seen it was still in the plastic and had no wear or tear
3707562 i didnt expect it to be stolen if it was stolen i would have run off from the police

3707574 were doing our best but we might have to be patient what is very much ongoing is getting the right players for the right money to play attractive football

3707576 im not even remotely thinking about leaving because ive only just arrived
3707577 i believe with this management team weve got a lot to do and we want to take it forward i love wolves and i very much want to see what we can do this season
3707578 i dont think we need to supplement the squad much more perhaps just the odd extra player because were in great shape

3707609 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3707610 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3707611 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3707622 the reductions in harmful emissions secured by this settlement are substantial and will have a beneficial impact on air quality in arizona and downwind areas
3707623 srps willingness to settle rather than litigate the various issues in this case allowed the parties to focus their efforts on securing the best results for the environment
3707624 we determined that the best path with epa was to reach a settlement that would be reasonable and fair for both parties
3707625 at best these petition gatherers were uninformed at worst they were careless and misleading
3707626 regardless their actions are unacceptable and do not serve the best interests of the electorate

3707635 deeply disturbed by a conclusion that would severely curtail the freedom of the media to cover the conflict by effectively giving soldiers a free hand to kill without being sure that they were not firing on journalists
3707636 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3707637 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera

3707655 the pa palestinian authority retakes control of the gaza strip
3707656 feels there is time to reach an agreement during his remaining time in office
3707657 as a test balloon so they can blame the palestinian authority should the negotiations fail

3707660 dakwaan itu palsu dan tidak benar saya sendiri telah menjalankan siasatan dalaman terhadap kesemua pegawai bpr yang terlibat semasa sesi soal siasat bersama abdullah pada 5 ogos sebagaimana yang didakwanya

3707670 there is an enormous amount of potential growth out there for us
3707671 based on focusing our pv mosfet drivers in pursuit of the billion unit per year mosfet marketplace and every one of them needs some means of turning it on amp off or driving it a mosfet
3707672 is a power transistor that is typically used in motor control or switching applications and whether the mosfet is controlling a motor in a windshield wiper or is part of an automated aircraft electronic test system there is just no safer way to drive it the laws of physics actually guarantee that a photovoltaic pv device is simply the most reliable way to drive or control a mosfet
3707673 and our near term goal is to make the marketplace more aware of our advantages although there will also be both financial and technical challenges involved with increasing our production rates and reducing our manufacturing costs the prospect of possibly boosting our annual sales volume to 25 million representing just one percent of the available market makes the struggle worth while after all
3707674 we invented the pv mosfet driver many years ago and continued all these years improving its performance now that the market has grown to huge proportions and we are again healthy enough for the challenge we are determined to concentrate our efforts there and aggressively face up to that challenge
3707675 serck controls will apply our communications in the area of water oil and gas power and utilities process control and safety systems all around the world

3707690 cisco is the first company you think of when evaluating ip based physical security
3707691 we chose the cisco physical security solution for many reasons but the primary one was that it allows us to reduce the amount of time it takes our employees to search for a specific timeframe of coverage what literally took us hours to locate on our old fashioned vhs tapes now takes us only minutes with our video recorders
3707692 the quantum scalar i500 systems provide the scalability performance and reliability our customers require allowing us to start small and expand gradually as our requirements grow
3707693 we were particularly amazed by the increase in the speed of our backups using the scalar i500 during testing both i500 units performed perfectly validating the strength of our overall disaster recovery plan since then we have experienced many months of flawless backups in our production environment with no tape failures and no hardware malfunctions
3707694 as customers demand higher capacity greater performance and more advanced management features across their tape systems this shipment milestone underscores quantums focus on intelligent tape library design

3707698 it is important to note that the hedging loss for the quarter was non cash and does not necessarily reflect the expected future cash settlement value of the contracts

3707701 though agricultural commodity prices have moderated they remain quite favorable by historical standards and are continuing to provide strong support to farm incomes and to the sale of productive farm machinery worldwide
3707702 these are all indiscriminate weapons when used in populated areas as they cannot be targeted against only military targets and therefore risk causing unnecessary harm to civilians
3707703 they simply shouldnt be used in areas where there are civilians
3707704 to defend their families and their motherland together with the russian army
3707705 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3707706 for conditions in which antibiotics have questionable benefit such as many mild upper respiratory tract infections weighing the benefits of antibiotics with the risks of a serious adverse event will be especially important
3707707 because antibiotics are frequently used both appropriately and inappropriately if doctors would reduce the number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even a small percentage we could significantly reduce the number of emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events physicians need to communicate to their patients that antibiotics are not harmless
3707708 the premeditated slaying of john lennon with an essentially clear mind
3707709 your conduct thus precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals
3707710 your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the instant offense and undermine respect for the law

3707712 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides

3707722 people have got to learn that clicking on links in messages to websites can lead to a malware infection whether the messages are in your email or on a site like facebook there has been a flurry of malicious emails recently posing as links to videos so theres really no excuse not to know of this trick being commonly used by hackers at the moment
3707723 companies will once again be considering whether its time to block facebook in the workplace not just for the usual productivity reasons but because of the security threats that sites like this may pose to their enterprise
3707724 companies need to make their own mind up as to whether they want to allow their users to access websites like facebook and myspace during office hours if workers are allowed to be given access to these sites then its vital that they do not put their personal and corporate data at risk and are protected from web based infections
3707725 the best defense is for businesses to defend themselves with a web security and control appliance which can filter internet access and prevent the downloading of malicious code
3707726 as children age direct caretaking and influence diminish and children are often seen by their parents as peers with whom they are have continuing relationships

3707741 the problem is that these investments dont earn as high a rate of return over long periods and the lost profits add up to huge amounts of money
3707742 the magic of compound interest is tremendous and the younger you are the more money youll make
3707743 post a picture of your dream house o n the refrigerator for inspiration congratulate yourself as your bank or investment balances grow
3707744 theres no question social security will continue to exist however it will pay smaller benefits than it presently does and youll have to be older to collect those benefits than current retirees

3707747 there was a whole lot of whooping and high fiving going on
3707748 because its a tradition to buy a round of drinks for everyone on the course after hitting a hole in one i was telling frank harvey and darryl that it would be a perfect day to do so since there wasnt too many people around because of the weather
3707749 some days i cut fairways other days i cut greens i do anything they want me to do
3707750 it is encouraging that notifications have increased as this appears to indicate a growing intolerance of child abuse and neglect within new zealand communities rather than an increase in the incidence of abuse
3707751 what to do with the children suffering from abuse and neglect is the important next step to take early intervention is crucial working intensively with high risk families is the most successfully proven method of reducing the risk and therefore the incidence of child abuse it is the family help trusts experience that families want to do better but they need support to do this
3707752 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3707753 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3707754 there is no doubt that fadel shanas death is a tragedy
3707755 however the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehavior i have therefore decided that no further legal measures will be taken
3707756 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly
3707757 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3707758 these findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and theres not that much that can be done
3707759 he was a brave soldier who made the greatest sacrifice anyone could make for everyone elses freedom
3707760 he realized that by being over there he was going to make a difference in the lives of those people
3707761 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies
3707762 he had no problem he was dedicated to the fact that people over there needed help he was always concerned about other people he loved children he was a nice soft hearted kid

3707847 the liberal partys green shift announced on june 19th marked the most aggressive anti poverty program in 40 years the shift will transfer wealth from rich to poor from the oil patch to the rest of the country and from the coffers of big business to the pockets of low income canadians
3707848 but maybe can you help us with the green shift
3707849 this is the most aggressive anti poverty program in forty years the shift will transfer wealth from rich to poor from the oil patch to the rest of the country and from the coffers of big business to the pockets of low income canadians
3707850 no the green shift is trying to be equitable across the country it doesnt shift anything from one province to another thats the first misinformation that i think people are giving out

3707885 salah satu cara orang orang yahudi untuk mengusir rakyat palestina dari tanah dan kampungnya adalah dengan mengepung desa mereka dari tiga arah satu arah dibiarkan terbuka setelah dari tiga sisi dikepung orang orang yahudi yang bersenjata itu menembaki orang orang palestina siapa saja tujuannya adalah untuk menimbulkan ketakutan sehingga mereka orang orang palestina itu keluar dari rumah rumah mereka dan meninggalkan kampung mereka cara cara ini biasa dilakukan pada malam hari tatkala orang orang palestina tengah terlelap sehingga ketika mereka berlari meninggalkan rumahnya mereka tidak membawa bekal apa pun
3707886 setelah desa berhasil dikosongkan maka orang orang yahudi itu saat itu juga menduduki wilayah tersebut dan mengklaim tanah itu sebagai tanah milik orang yahudi the homeland
3707887 selain cara mengepung dari tiga arah orang orang yahudi juga menggunakan cara pengepungan empat arah

3707899 what would happen if this province with its agricultural production did not exist
3707900 why do these two neighboring provinces farm the same types of crops
3707901 om die burgers te voorzien van informatie moet de kamer optimaal gebruikmaken van informatie en communicatietechnologie door verandering van werken kan de kamer burgers ook interactief betrekken bij het tot stand komen van wet en regelgeving
3707902 internetten is geen op zichzelf staande activiteit meer het is diep verweven in ons dagelijks bestaan
3707903 zon filmpje over een model dat een minuut lang enorme onzin vertelt krijgt direct miljoenen kijkers en daardoor is ze ineens nieuws
3707904 zeker in de vs moeten politici zich goed realiseren dat elke seconde die ze buiten de slaapkamer doorbrengen openbaar gemaakt kan worden e n enkele fout kan het einde van een politieke carri re betekenen
3707905 ze sturen regelmatig mensen naar een camera achter hun concurrenten aan in de hoop dat die iets doms doen of zeggen
3707906 ik hoor vaak zeggen dat youtube ervoor zorgt dat er meer mensen in politiek ge nteresseerd zijn onzin al het wetenschappelijke onderzoek toont slechts n ding aan mensen die toch al in politiek ge nteresseerd zijn hebben nu meer bronnen
3707907 net zoals die cnn debatten ook geen fundamenteel verschil maken het is een andere manier meer niet
3707908 de geschiedenis leert ons dat we met nieuwe media eerst precies hetzelfde doen als we met de oude media doen pas later komen er nieuwe toepassingen
3707909 het grootste belang van youtube is dat het de eenzijdigheid van de media definitief doorbroken heeft
3707910 televisiezenders bepalen niet langer waar we naar kijken het avondje avro is voorbij bovendien kan iedereen nu zelf filmpjes maken en toevoegen
3707911 alles loopt door elkaar heen dat is het meest wetenschappelijke dat ik ervan kan maken
3707912 er zijn naar schatting tussen de 100 en 150 miljoen weblogs maar het is te makkelijk om ze links te laten liggen omdat het nu eenmaal een zootje is soms brengen ze bijzondere verhalen in iran zijn er bijvoorbeeld relatief veel bloggers die brengen het verhaal van de straat dat is een verrijking
3707913 het is theoretisch een leuk idee dat burgers toegang krijgen tot een wereldwijd publiek maar de praktijk is ingewikkeld bedrijven plaatsen negatieve berichten over hun concurrenten op youtube en dat doen ze natuurlijk niet onder hun eigen naam er spelen allerlei moeilijk te doorgronden politieke en commerci le belangen
3707914 de journalistiek kan de weg wijzen dat hebben journalisten altijd gedaan orde scheppen in de chaos ze kunnen een selectie maken met de leukste zeldzaamste leugenachtigste of nuttigste filmpjes het voordeel van de oude media is dat je weet waar ze voor staan lezers weten inmiddels wel wat ze van een krant als trouw kunnen verwachten dat betekent niet dat er nooit fouten worden gemaakt maar aan de manier waarop die worden rechtgezet zie je dat je zon krant kunt vertrouwen en die wetenschap ontbreekt bij al die anonieme bronnen op het web
3707915 maar journalisten hebben niet voor hun vak gekozen om andermans werk te beoordelen die willen zelf verhalen schrijven
3707916 ik hoor mensen vaak zeggen dat ze zo machteloos zijn als een of ander bedrijf ze weer iets geflikt heeft maar we kunnen er wat aan doen het internet is een ideale manier om actiever je mening uit te dragen het publiek moet mondiger worden in de vs zijn regelmatig protesten van groepen burgers over allerlei onderwerpen hier in nederland zie je dat niet ze denken dat de overheid alles wel voor ze regelt
3707917 and that means the people in the fifth district dont have the kind of representation they deserve i think he has advocated his own personal agenda at the expense of the people
3707918 i know when he ran for office he was very intent on an expansion of highways and improving highways
3707919 ive seen other members of congress within the state of iowa be able to secure demonstration monies to by 10 miles at a time expand highway 34 for example into a four lane highway
3707920 its a given that highway 20 will be completed all the way to sioux city
3707921 i believe i have given every effort to keep my word on those two infrastructure things both of those things will get done
3707922 we dont have an energy policy and congressman king has to accept some of the responsibility for that because he was in the majority for a considerable period with a republican president
3707923 the swp was for many years the leading voice of trotskyism in the usa
3707924 since the 1980s the swp has drifted away from trotskyism and moved towards the brand of authoritarian politics espoused by cuban leader fidel castros style of marxism
3707925 our job is to protect uk dental patients by making sure all dental professionals practising in the uk are trained appropriately and registered with us
3707926 thats why we want to encourage people considering travelling abroad for dental care to ask questions before making a decision about their treatment qualifications and standards are likely to differ from country to country so its important that you collect as much information as you can before committing to anything
3707927 the national dental survey 2008 found that 16 of people would be willing to travel abroad for dental treatment and the figure was even higher among the 18 to 30 age group suggesting the trend will continue
3707928 this document provides members of the public with a very useful starting point on the questions to ask before getting dental treatment abroad
3707929 styles and standards of dentistry can vary a great deal from one country to another and if things do go wrong patients could still be left facing some difficult and potentially expensive decisions
3707930 however by researching their chosen practitioner and asking the right questions they can reduce the chances of encountering potentially avoidable problems further down the line
3707931 community pharmacies are easily accessible and many people often see pharmacists more often than any other healthcare professional both these factors make pharmacy an important tool in the delivery of vascular screening additionally community pharmacy will also offer health promotion advice and referral as appropriate
3707932 if prescribing data is released at an identifiable practice level then not only might some surgeries be identified but in the instances where a single pharmacy is close to a surgery individual pharmacies could be identified if as often is the case the pharmacy dispenses the majority of prescriptions written by that surgery the business turnover of that single pharmacy could be calculated
3707933 this information could be used by other companies wishing to purchase the business open a new pharmacy business with the control of entry regulations for deciding if a pharmacy is necessary or expedient open a pharmacy under the control of entry exemption clauses e g a 100 hour pharmacy
3707934 breastfeeding interventions and promotion efforts must take into consideration changing cultural norms hopefully this will lead to an environment that is more supportive of breastfeeding thereby helping us move toward attainment of the healthy people 2010 breastfeeding goals

3707937 the efficacy of female condom skills training in hiv risk reduction among women a randomized controlled trial
3707938 we saw for ourselves that the new system includes human as well as automatic accuracy checks nevertheless no system is infallible and the ppd as well as pharmacists must be vigilant in ensuring that mistakes are kept to a minimum whats more when pharmacists query payments they have a right to expect an efficient and full response brian alexander undertook at the meeting that he will personally review whether this part of the process may be made more transparent we look forward to further dialogue on this matter
3707939 in formulating eiffel we worked closely with the fda who reviewed our extensive bench and biocompatibility testing along with the long term outcomes of our international lip augmentation study
3707940 we are quite pleased with this approval and are optimistic that the trial endpoints will be met fulfil lip will be the first treatment of any kind to be specifically labeled for lip enhancement
3707941 i am excited to begin enrolling patients into the eiffel study
3707942 overall the fulfil tm implant performed well in the international trial placing the implants is straightforward patients appreciated the fact that it could be performed in an outpatient setting using only local anesthesia in the trial 47 patients had lip enhancement with fulfil in follow up of more than a year and up to 2 years in some cases there were no serious device related adverse events on a scale of 0 to 7 patient satisfaction averaged 6 3 indicating a high degree of aesthetic benefit
3707943 maternity services for all women could and should be so much better we acknowledge that most women are happy with the service they get but too many are unsatisfied and frustrated
3707944 midwives pay is not keeping pace with prices staff numbers are not keeping pace with the birthrate and investment is not keeping pace with the demands on the service
3707945 we are going to see a haemorrhage in the profession if the conditions midwives work in are not addressed give midwives the tools and resources to do their job and they will deliver a service of which this country can be proud
3707946 the value of this short trial is that it provides a potential surrogate for antiviral efficacy of vivagel r in humans ahead of phase 3 studies
3707947 it will also give an indication of just how long before sex you could apply vivagel r to prevent infection
3707948 this report shows us that there are still hurdles that keep all americans from getting the best health care available regardless of which agencies help them get it
3707949 we shouldnt let the distance between ihs and cms get in the way of quality affordable health care for american indians and alaska natives

3707965 the rural schools group filed the lawsuit in 2004 arguing that small poor school districts are treated unfairly because they do not raise enough money from local taxes to make up for cuts in state education spending
3707966 if the state loses at trial georgia could be forced to increase the amount spent on education by more than 1 billion a year and to change the way it distributes money among school districts
3707967 after a worrisome start to the growing season that fanned fears of food shortages and huge economic losses the nations most important crop is now on track for a bountiful harvest
3707968 food industry groups went to battle with ethanol interests saying there was not enough corn for both food and fuel corn futures prices soared to an unheard of 8 a bushel triple the price of a few years ago
3707969 some analysts worried that 9 or even 10 a bushel was possible that price would probably have been ruinous to livestock producers and ethanol plants alike although corn farmers would have been in clover but after the floodwaters receded nature turned benign in the midwest this summer the weather has been exactly what the tender young corn stalks needed to thrive

3707979 what were beginning to see is almost the monopolization of our dietary intake by a handful of corporations
3707980 add to that the financial reality of feeding ourselves today where a single grapefruit from a corner fruit stand costs two or more times as much as a few chicken mcnuggets

3708021 the lebanese shiite hezbollah movement announced wednesday that its guerrillas have captured two israeli soldiers in southern lebanon
3708022 implementing our promise to release the arab prisoners in israeli jails our strugglers have captured at 9 05 am 0605 gmt two israeli soldiers in southern lebanon
3708023 lebanese police said that the two soldiers were captured as they infiltrated into the town of aitaa al chaab inside the lebanese border
3708024 there was no immediate confirmation of the hezbollah claims from any official israeli source
3708025 an israeli army spokeswoman however said there was concern over the fate of the two soldiers

3708030 until he gave evidence i formed the view it was less likely that he had actually inflicted the injuries however i found his evidence also completely unreliable but not as floridly so as the mothers he too pursued a cut throat defence in the light of his evidence i cannot rule out the possibility that he too may have been responsible for some of these injuries his explanation for accepting the bruising really defies belief i find as a fact that he has colluded with the mother in an attempt to exculpate both of them he at best adopted a callous attitude to the injuries this child sustained doing nothing whatsoever to protect the child when he knew the child was being seriously physically abused
3708031 she maintains she is not guilty she is in denial she is the perpetrator as well as father she is responsible for many of the injuries i dont want delay what is the point it will hold out hope no one should entrust a child to her she needs years of cognitive behavioural therapy there is no purpose in raising her hopes she has lied completely
3708032 i would not give her care she has had a difficult childhood her personality is not mature she needs further work she needs cognitive behavioural therapy she needs lengthy therapy
3708033 it is clear that hes callous he played a part and i cannot rule him out i refuse it is false hope they both pose a serious risk to small children i cant distinguish between who did what he doubts he is father to c i will order dna but no assessments it would engender hope the children need to be adopted assessment is not appropriate as a result of the findings

3708111 our performance in the fourth quarter was helped by an impressive 44 increase in international sales however overall sales in both our protect amp direct and inform segments declined as we continue to see domestic economic pressures impact state and municipal spending on transportation safety products in the u s due to the lower sales volumes we also saw lower profitability in both segments our strong international sales were driven by growth in both the european and asia pacific regions approximately 24 of our overall sales were generated from international sales in fiscal 2008 compared with 19 a year ago looking forward we expect our international sales to be an increasingly important part of our overall business
3708112 the recent sale of the intersection control segment is an important step for quixote that strengthens our financial position and provides us with additional capital as we strategically focus on our significant international growth opportunities one recent international initiative was the opening of a new office in dubai which resulted in nearly 1 million in revenue this year we believe our local presence in the middle east will be an important factor in penetrating this very attractive market in addition we also plan to continue investing in the development of new products such as our vorteq tm truck mounted attenuator and our vulcan r moveable steel barrier which will help increase sales both here and abroad by offering our customers increasingly innovative solutions to address their needs
3708113 while the domestic marketplace remains challenging we are taking the necessary steps to move forward as a stronger company and plan to continue investing in international opportunities and in new product lines to position ourselves in the most compelling markets with industry leading products and services while the near term outlook for domestic state and municipal spending on transportation safety products remains uncertain there remains a need to invest in an aging u s infrastructure that has to be addressed we believe our current strategic focus will help offset the current uncertainty in the domestic market and position us for long term growth once domestic infrastructure spending improves

3708131 our gross profit margin for the six month period ended june 30 2008 increased to 19 1 percent compared to 14 8 percent for the same period in 2007 and was 19 6 percent compared to 12 2 percent for the three months periods ended june 30 2008 and 2007 respectively there were several factors that contributed to the increase including more efficient project execution on a number of projects cost savings related to the success of our global procurement initiative and the completion of warranty periods on several projects at better than historical levels resulting in the release of provisions on the expiration of these warranty periods
3708132 we must continue to concentrate on execution margins converting the strong backlog into earnings and building the value of khd in a risk prudent manner we continue to build our capability and capacity to offer and successfully execute an expanded scope of services the nature of the potential work and the location of certain opportunities result in a risk profile that could be higher than our traditional services we continue to be selective in choosing which opportunities we have and will pursue with a renewed emphasis on value margin and risk furthermore we have and will continue to target higher margin projects on a global basis rather than our historical practice of targeting the highest margin projects in a specific geography we believe it is important our shareholders clearly understand our strategy and although a consequence of this strategy may be fewer mega project awards compared to some of our competitors the objective of our strategy is continued generation of quality earnings
3708133 we continue to hold 100 million of cash earmarked for investment in growth in dollars rather than in euros the recent appreciation of the dollar against the euro which significantly reduces the reported unrealized foreign exchange loss on these funds illustrates the need from an economic perspective for khd to hold cash in both us dollars and euros
3708134 our general and administrative expenses excluding stock based compensation increased to 26 6 million for the six month period ended june 30 2008 from 20 3 million in 2007 and for the three month period ended june 30 2008 it increased to 13 7 million from 10 8 million in 2007 a large proportion of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than the dollar a weakening of the dollar therefore increases our reported expenses general and administrative expenses increased for the six month period by approximately 2 9 million and for the three month period by 1 5 million as a consequence of the weakening dollar additional costs related to wabush iron ore royalty arbitration were also incurred the remaining increase is primarily linked to the growth of administrative and supporting services for the expansion of business activities

3708234 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3708235 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3708236 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3708237 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3708238 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3708239 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3708240 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3708241 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3708242 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3708243 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3708244 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3708245 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3708246 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3708247 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3708248 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3708249 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3708250 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

3708252 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3708253 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3708254 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3708255 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3708256 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3708257 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3708258 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3708259 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3708260 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3708261 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3708262 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3708263 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3708264 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3708265 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3708266 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3708267 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3708268 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3708269 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3708270 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3708271 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3708272 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3708273 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3708274 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3708275 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3708276 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3708277 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3708278 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3708279 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3708280 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3708281 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3708282 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3708283 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3708284 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3708285 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3708286 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3708287 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3708288 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3708289 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3708290 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3708291 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3708292 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3708293 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3708294 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3708295 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3708296 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3708297 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3708298 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3708299 the russians are looting everything in sight the whole city is full of marauders
3708300 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3708301 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3708302 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3708303 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968
3708304 russia has one foot in integration into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in
3708305 russia is going to have to assure its integration into the wto and the oecd and the g8 and institutions like that
3708306 to undermine our relations to curtail our relations we might as well let the us deal on its own with some of the issues

3708332 there is no question that the bush administration will want to express its disapproval and to downgrade the relationship

3708393 furchtbar dass so etwas in r sselsheim passiert wo die unterschiedlichen nationen eigentlich ganz gut zusammenhalten

3708395 sie wollen unbedingt herkommen aber das ist nicht n tig wir werden anna in griechenland beerdigen

3708399 in this age of 4 a gallon gas and staycations we felt that vudu customers deserved a break and should be able to watch a great film for just 99 cents
3708400 these initiatives are groundbreaking our 99 cent rental renewal is a first in our industry and will make it easier for our viewers to finish watching a great movie when it fits their schedule not ours
3708401 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3708402 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3708403 youre looking at a cinematic device employed by zhang yimou here this is actually almost animation a footstep a second 29 in all to signify the 29 olympiads

3708406 der rudersport in unserem land lebt nun einmal vom deutschland achter und da sind wir weit entfernt von den erfolgen alter tage
3708407 das geschehen von peking muss personelle konsequenzen haben aber es fehlt im verband an bereitschaft die situation zu analysieren
3708408 der posten des sportdirektors michael m ller muss als konsequenz des schlechten sportlichen abschneidens bei den spielen neu besetzt werden auch die verbandsspitze um pr sident siegfried kaidel muss zur cktreten
3708409 der sieger dieses rennens h tte sich ohne st ndigen gegenwind auf die olympischen spiele vorbereiten k nnen das h tte enorme psychologische vorteile gehabt
3708410 unser argument war wenn die neue mannschaft gewinnt dann sind sie nicht angreifbar sondern konkurrenzf hig sie haben dann einen ma stab weil sie den weltmeister von 2006 geschlagen haben diesen vorschlag lehnte sportdirektor michael m ller ab seine begr ndung der zeitpunkt so kurz vor olympia w re zu kurzfristig
3708411 wir werden den drv fragen wie das konzept f r den deutschland achter k nftig aussieht
3708412 mit zwei kandidaten haben wir bereits geredet das gespr ch mit einem dritten steht noch aus
3708413 it would not be right to talk about these things
3708414 threat to the whole world order and there are many actions to be made in the realm of intelligence and preventive measures
3708415 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
3708416 it makes sense to have a more permanent presence up there in new york primarily with sales activities as business continues to grow and the size and scope of ad programs get bigger
3708417 so long as the people do not care to exercise their freedom those who wish to tyrannize will do so for tyrants are active and ardent and will devote themselves in the name of any number of gods religious and otherwise to put shackles upon sleeping men
3708418 it is high time for me to put an end to your sitting in this place which you have dishonored by your contempt of all virtue and defiled by your practice of every vice ye are a factious crew and enemies to all good government ye are a pack of mercenary wretches and would like esau sell your country for a mess of pottage and like judas betray your god for a few pieces of money
3708419 never never never believe any war will be smooth and easy or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter the statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events
3708420 when we first read about baby ethan in your paper we were flabbergasted we knew about moogera and had been keeping an eye on him but we had no idea that he had fathered a child with ms mccauley
3708421 the fact that young ethan has many of the same extraterrestrial powers as his galactic deadbeat dad makes it imperative that we study him further his powers of levitation alone if harnessed would be a tremendous asset to our military
3708422 the only way youll get my baby is to pry him from my cold dead hands
3708423 first i have to tell you its normal to see strange things going on at the mccauley home
3708424 weird lights in the middle of the night mountain lions hissing at the door alien beings hovering outside the window but when three black sedans pulled up and a bunch of guys in cheap black business suits jumped out that was unusual
3708425 she hauled butt down a dirt road to grove street then she really opened er up
3708426 but the faster we went the faster she went it was like that 4 4 had afterburners i could swear they were flying
3708427 she kissed that pink eyed spawn of hers and said ill just be a minute honey
3708428 then she came in to pay for a fill up and milk
3708429 that baby was levitatin above the pumps suddenly he took off like a bottle rocket
3708430 i was doing my morning rush hour broadcast when i saw this baby fly past
3708431 i thought maybe a stork had dropped the poor thing and he got caught in an updraft but no this kid was flying
3708432 oh they wont find that tyke unless he wants to be found
3708433 i was once playing peek a boo with him between peek and boo he went off got a container of yogurt and dumped it on my head hes a playful kid but weird and fast
3708434 happy people are more likely than unhappy people to get married are more likely to stay married are more likely to think their marriage is good
3708435 theyre more likely to volunteer theyre more likely to be rated highly by their supervisor and theyre more likely to make more money
3708436 if youre worried about success in life dont be a 1 2 3 or 4 on the 10 point scale
3708437 if you are unhappy or only slightly happy you may need to seek help or read those self help books or do something to make yourself happier but if youre a 7 or 8 maybe youre happy enough
3708438 i definitely was fearful of being branded at an early age with a role that i enjoyed immensely but didnt want to keep doing and probably just out of boredom i was interested in playing crazy interesting parts as i got older the crazy roles just found me i guess like barney thats so crazy that found me but i love it being a leading man is fun but i always find the periphery a more exciting environment but hey if someone wants to hand me the shoe ill see if it fits
3708439 i didnt release a statement to them but at the first himym barbecue i brought david i feel like its important to be proud of who you are so i didnt feel like i should bring my friend stephanie to this barbecue or ill lose my job thankfully i live in a time where i dont have to worry about that
3708440 i think if i was an outspoken activist they probably would have had some concerns that people wouldnt have believed me in the role completely i think the majority of people just want to see how talented you can be and if im going to play a leading male heterosexual in a role id better act like that for that picture and the audition and represent well and i would hope that would still get me the job
3708441 is the greatest shes got it all shes got a great life she works an hour and a half a day shes funny shes sexy shes savvy she plays the kelly ripa part and she gets the joke and its so fun not to have to memorize lines you go out there you spend 20 minutes just talking about stuff you interview people and you dont really even have to know what youre talking about because someone behind them has the cards with all the questions on it
3708442 mmmm anderson hes dreamy just dreamy ive been a fan of his since season 1 of the mole i just thought he was so cool when he talked in this cool low secret agent voice if you can accomplish this task
3708443 listen no one can tell anyone how big their steps should be or when they can take them you can take issue with someone making overtly denying statements and you can take issue with people straight up presenting themselves as someone that theyre not because i think thats kind of shady and not very stand up but you cant fault someone for going through the process at their own time you cant
3708444 there are many young strong single people in the athletes village and like everywhere some will fall in love or other things so we need to make condoms available
3708445 a lot of these young people are not married or in relationships so we want to make sure they have the information and tools to protect themselves if they have sexual encounters
3708446 frequently text messages the illinois senator with whom hes been friends for many years
3708447 i have never texted or emailed senator obama and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
3708448 ive spent more time with senator mccain than i have with senator obama i would hope that my friend john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics although i support senator obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me
3708449 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayer
3708450 while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humor and the familiar comfort of his voice
3708451 es ist von kritischer bedeutung durch solche transaktionen unsere krebsmedikamenten pipeline zu erweitern
3708452 die banken sind immer noch weit davon entfernt die finanzkrise in den griff zu bekommen
3708453 gerade als man dachte die nachrichtenlage d nne sich aus haben diese meldungen ganz sch n aufs gem t geschlagen
3708454 der nachrichtenfluss ist schon seit einiger zeit nicht unbedingt positiv jetzt kommt die gewinnwarnung dazu und die allgemeine konsumlaune in deutschland stimmt nun auch nicht unbedingt optimistisch
3708455 ein feindlicher bernahmeversuch von w re wahrscheinlich einidealszenario f r investoren wir berpr fen vor diesem hintergrund unsere anlageempfehlung verkaufen
3708456 i say how i feel and im very honest about it mediatakeout com likes to bring celebrities down thats not what i do
3708457 i feel like if majority of americans can accept these pedophile catholic priests molesting and raping their children then i should be able to heal those emotional scars through my music and literature without censorship issues
3708458 these whacked out parents dont understand the mentalities and the emotional needs of their own children said newt they dont take the necessary time to learn about what they created there are reasons why kids go to school and shoot everybody up there was a reason my homegirl blew her head off her shoulders there is a reason why a three year old girl starts crying when you leave her alone with her grandfather i am just giving you the reasons why
3708459 i dont care what people may say or think about who i am what i am or what i am about i refuse to let the opinions and comments of others deter me from my mission and vision im always gonna stand up for what i believe in even if im the only one standing
3708460 the poles end up flipping because these flows transport south pointing magnetic flux to the north magnetic pole and north pointing flux to the south magnetic pole
3708461 because sunspots make a pattern in this plot that looks like the wings of a butterfly
3708462 changes in the suns magnetic field are carried outward through the heliosphere by the solar wind
3708463 it takes about a year for disturbances to propagate all the way from the sun to the outer bounds of the heliosphere
3708464 the impact of the field reversal on the heliosphere is complicated
3708465 now it will loop back and fly over the north pole in the fall
3708466 now we get to see the suns poles during the other extreme solar max our data will cover a complete solar cycle
3708467 in view of what many lgbt people suffer throughout the world on account of their sexual orientation

3708473 were so concerned that we have already written to the eu commissioner to raise awareness of how compromising the proposed changes might be
3708474 earlier representations are likely to fall on deaf ears since the issue wont be on the radar yet
3708475 we need to get the message over to consumers that pesticides are widely used if these proposals go through we wont be able to produce the quantity and quality of a whole range of commodities we need in europe
3708476 we wont be able to pull in supplies from elsewhere
3708477 a european impact assessment must be carried out so that we dont destroy a successful and vibrant industry
3708478 we need time to respond and not have things imposed on us
3708479 the meaning of a text is that pattern of meaning the author willed to convey by the words he used

3708491 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3708492 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3708493 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3708494 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3708495 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3708496 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3708497 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3708498 een wachter in kerk en samenleving die het oecumenisch vuur van de geest heeft gediend
3708499 de aandacht voor de samenlevingsvragen het gesprek over de geloofsvragen overvleugelde
3708500 geen oecumene zonder crisis ten aanzien van je eigen geloof
3708501 conservatieve richtingen die vasthouden aan de eigen tradities en zo overleven of zelfs nieuwe aanhangers krijgen
3708502 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3708503 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3708504 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3708505 ontkomt niet of nauwelijks aan de bevinding die gelegen is in massale samenzang in de grote kerk van tholen met psalmen van petrus datheen begeleid door een gul in de toetsen grijpende organist
3708506 ze brengen als geloofspo zie onder woorden wat ooit mensen ten diepste dachten ten zeerste vreesden tot het uiterste hoopten
3708507 meestal de ervaring tarten en verwijzen naar een werkelijkheid die niet voor het grijpen ligt maar daarmee nog niet minder werkelijkheid hoeft te wezen
3708508 maar daarmee nog niet fictief er is en blijft een belangrijk onderscheid tussen fictie en fictionaliteit
3708509 contouren op van een bewust gecomponeerde dramatische opbouw van het psalmboek als geheel en van series en collecties daarin
3708510 alle rechtvaardigen uit de wereldgeschiedenis zijn in deze totus christus verenigd
3708511 het psalter is het gebedenboek van jezus christus in de meest eigenlijke zin nu bidt de nieuwe mensheid op aarde het lichaam jezus gebed en die gemeenschap breidt zich uit tot allen die hongeren en dorsten naar gerechtigheid
3708512 elk roepen uit de diepten alle jubel om bevrijding ze klinken uiteindelijk als de ene stem van het messiaanse lichaam
3708513 drama van crisis en hoop de psalmen gedicht gebundeld en gebeden
3708514 het zorgvuldigst in de combinatie van trouw aan de brontaal gevoel voor po zie en gebruik voor de getijden
3708515 het heeft mij onthuld dat het schijnbaar achterlijke spreken in psalmen van de
3708516 maar het is natuurlijk niet alleen rooms ook in de anglicaanse kerk bestaat deze traditie zij het op een iets andere manier
3708517 aan dooden toegewijd ter rustplaats t graf is heilig en zij wier asch hier rust zijn voor all onrust veilig schoon hen geen marmer dekt maar heide groei in t rond
3708518 welk een wijsheid welk een almacht toont het eenvoudig blaadje
3708519 dan hoor ik in het loeien der stormen een loflied voor jehovah o hoevele bronnen van vermaak levert de natuur op aan een wijsheidzoekende landbewoonster
3708520 je kunt beter zwijgen bij volle maan ik kijk naar de maan ik zie de teer verlichte aarde dan roept het hoge licht zelf een woord wakker als ik uw hemel aanzie het werk van uw vingers de maan en de sterren die gij bereid hebt wat is de mens ik kan niet zwijgen
3708521 bij mijn thuisreis brak de zon door de regenwolken en overgoot de hei en de bossen met een heilig licht ik at mijn boterhammen met de bosbessen die ik vond langs de wegen een zwart everzwijn kruiste mijn pad en verdween in het woud een stralende regenboog stond in de wolken
3708522 ieder zingt op zijn wijs het oudere geslacht zoveel het nog kan in het oude tempo terwijl het jonge volk er de jacht in zet
3708523 het is in elk geval niet altijd eender en dat zal wel de bedoeling hebben om het maar nooit van onszelf te verwachten maar in steeds dieper afhankelijkheid op te zien tot hem die het alleen maar maken kan
3708524 t is de mensen niet aan te zien wie zou gedroomd hebben dat die predikant die laatst bij mij te eten was toegang tot het heiligdom der zanggodinnen had
3708525 ik ben ietwat onrustig bij de gedachte aan een zo gevierd gezelschap waarin ik met niemand intiem ben maar dat is voor mij geen reden om af te slaan
3708526 alles te verduwen wat ik zo gezwind heb ingezwolgen veel immers laat een pijnlijk brandend gevoel na voornamelijk wat op de overtuiging en de dienst van god ziet
3708527 zondag was ik er in alle bescheidenheid van overtuigd dat geen dominee in het hele land een betere preek gehouden had dan ik maar ik vermoed dat ik alleen stond in die mening want niemand heeft er ook maar het minste woord aan gewijd
3708528 soms zit ik in mijn ochtendjas en op pantoffels te schrijven soms ben ik tot een twee uur in de nacht bezig maar soms raak ik mijn schrijverspen een weeklang niet aan
3708529 ik heb het een en andermaal geprobeerd maar hij had een vriendje van de vrije universiteit al beloofd dat die een biografie over hem mocht schrijven jammer voor mij maar niets aan te doen
3708530 toeval bestaat niet maar ik liep enkele weken geleden zeer onverwacht rouvoet tegen het lijf in een restaurant
3708531 hij vindt dat andr meer moet luisteren naar mensen die heel dicht bij hem staan
3708532 iemand die de wijsheid in pacht denkt te hebben en uit gods naam zijn waandenkbeelden tracht op te leggen aan andersdenkenden
3708533 ik zou rouvoets god vragen hem zijn zegen te geven want de mijne krijgt hij niet
3708534 ze heeft dit jaar niet voor niets de anne vondelingprijs voor politieke journalistiek ontvangen
3708535 nrc handelsblad is mijn lijfblad maar het rd is een goede tweede ik kreeg de krant eerst van mijn christelijke buren toen ik hun vertelde dat ik zelf een abonnement ging nemen wisten ze niet wat ze hoorden
3708536 van nieuwenhuizen waar blijf je nu ik heb je de afgelopen tijd door twee zware operaties heen geholpen toen bad je je vingers blauw maar nu hoor ik je niet meer
3708537 de sociaaldemocratie heeft met andere politieke stromingen veel betekend voor de arbeiders en voor de bestrijding van armoede daar moet de partij trots op zijn en zij moet niet besluiten haar ideologische veren af te schudden
3708538 ik zou nu niet op bos stemmen sp en groenlinks stralen ook te weinig uit van het klassieke sociale gedachtegoed ik vind dat de christenunie het erg goed doet de partij is het cement van de coalitie politiek gezien zit de partij tussen cda en pvda in misschien wordt het de volgende keer wel rouvoet
3708539 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3708540 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3708543 there is no need because supreme court judges cannot be transferred and there has never been such a transfer

3708617 handset manufacturers worldwide are in the midst of revamping their product lines against this new benchmark
3708618 until consumers are presented with a clear cut simple and inexpensive value model for accessing mobile video and tv content it will be hard to segment audiences at either an industry or geographic level

3708794 zionism creates anti semitism and we know zionism is the root cause for the pain suffering and bloodshed of the jewish people and they the zionists are the greatest factory of anti semitism worldwide judaism and zionism is not one and the same they are diametrically opposite we should not be mistaken one for the other and we shouldnt be responsible for the actions of what the zionists do now another of the problems that emanate actually from the zionist movement is the fact that they are encroaching upon the rights of the palestinian people the indigenous people who are living there and this is terribly wrong it is against every concept of the torah so whatever they are doing is totally wrong

3708799 some of them are showing signs of non cooperation but now they are beginning to realise the resolve of the president because once the emergency is declared in the power sector there will be stiff sanctions if they fail to meet their obligations and all these will be clearly spelt out as pre conditions for continued operations in our country
3708800 the president means business on this issue and wants to see more commitment from the oil companies doing business in nigeria

3708803 the security network which is made up of citizens must be trained for effectiveness
3708804 through such training intelligence gathering and processing may be brought to bear on the physical deficits or breaches in order to save the state and citizens from the consequences of such security breaches
3708805 for effective security posture resources must be provided be they human material resources or even funds they remain critical to ensuring physical response needed to apprehend those who commit breaches of security such resources intervention must however be timely and appropriate to the task at hand
3708806 this is necessary to avoid confusion and chaos when carrying out enforcing assignments the bombing of the word trade centre and the september 11 bombing in the us by al qaeda exposed this weakness in the us security system hence the creation of the department of home land security to that extent security structures must be dynamic and responsive
3708807 nigeria looms large in the global initiatives for peace and security and equally remains relevant in the equation as regards promotion and maintenance of peace in africa therefore all efforts at checking our internal flashpoints become very essential if nigeria is to be taken seriously by the international community for nigeria to continue to play a leading role in africa it must show the resilience of a country able to manage its own affairs particularly in terms of peace and security
3708808 this administration is mindful of the fact that there can be no development without peace just as there will be no peace without development

3708876 if were getting rich off of severance taxes from oil and gas we should share some of the money back with the people who are having such a hard time paying their bills
3708877 all of these steps that they are taking now are band aids
3708878 if they need help were willing to work with them
3708879 these are people that spent their whole lives in this community they have raised their families here
3708880 they have paid taxes here all these years and now something like this needs to be taken away when they need it and thats just a very hard thing to do for anyone in this business
3708881 no one likes doing it no one likes making these kinds of decisions but thats where we are

3708919 all the government projects that have been intended to help the poor ended up in the hands of rich people
3708920 according to my experience laptop warriors and those who know how to write project proposals are now on standby to eat up the money
3708921 i see no reason why the government is coming up with this project
3708922 the prdp is a commitment by the government to stabilise and recover the north over the next three years through a set of coherent programmes
3708923 we are very keen that prdp and other government reconstruction projects in the north are implemented well

3708942 you have to do a bigger variety of difficult skills now
3708943 in our era you could do one or two difficult moves then fill out the rest of your routine with things you are comfortable doing now you have to be a freak of nature to be able to do a world class routine
3708944 everybody knows how rock solid chellsie is and definitely on floor also she had a chance to perform because we all remember what kind of routine she did at the trials
3708945 we throw some of the hardest skills on the floor
3708946 we are built of the strongest legs in the world and we love to fly we love to tumble really hard honestly we do have a problem stepping out of bounds
3708947 i have no proof so i cannot say they are underage

3708955 i thought it was not really me driving a miura by myself past the company gate i remember the feeling i was approaching curves too fast but i wasnt at all i was so respectful yet afraid of the cars performance but the engines sound was making me smile the whole time
3708956 they say you never forget your first love and that miura was truly my first love it was personal to me because the car symbolized and embodied ferruccio lamborghinis philosophy it was an honor to drive it and still it is the miura is an icon in sports car history
3708957 despite driving so many years and kilometers everyday is still exciting and fresh with great emotion my longtime experience makes the driving more easy and pleasant and the feeling is always a friendly sensation
3708958 i have great satisfaction that lamborghini is being honored at the pebble beach concours delegance
3708959 pebble beach is the biggest and most famous car show in the world every enthusiast knows about it its a very exclusive event and its important for us to be here to see my company being honored by pebble beach and to be a judge is very satisfying
3708960 it will be difficult to judge them because they are all authentic and beautiful but i am happy they asked me to do it the list of lamborghinis is very impressive and i know every screw every part and detail of the cars so im looking forward to judging them
3708961 our q2 financial performance was disappointing the desktop pc market around the world weakened during the quarter and our miscalculation of competitive price position further pressured our desktop gpu business we have a great product line up and having taken the necessary pricing actions we are strongly positioned again our focus now is to drive cost improvements and to further enhance our competitiveness through the many exciting initiatives we have planned for the rest of the year

3708965 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
3708966 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
3708967 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things
3708968 hes a very nice guy and we had a real good time together
3708969 shes such a different character than jan shes earthy with no ulterior motives
3708970 you know shell either be a great mother or be the greatest example of what not to be as a mother
3708971 itll be interesting to see michael and jan now they always have a power struggle he had it all last season and now shes got it back again and it keeps them an interesting couple
3708972 i think creator greg daniels doesnt want to disrupt the magic that happens over at the office
3708973 i know a lot of people felt jan would be a perfect character for a spinoff and she is but shes important to michael and his evolution as a man she adds a real fight shes that surprise spice that makes the dish

3708981 did you know that the average american is blessed with a blissfully short memory and yet a seemingly endless appetite for nostalgia so much so that he or she is willing to forgive most transgressions and forego all pretenses of taste in exchange for a song that will sound excellent in very large speakers or at the beach are you aware that most of us are doddering sods brainless infants who prefer things big and loud and shiny and equate aesthetic excess with true happiness do you realize theres a sucker born every minute did i just let the cat out of the bag

3708983 the company has made good progress in improving the performance of the dominican republic facility during the third quarter although its inventory levels for activewear continue to be very low
3708984 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
3708985 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
3708986 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles
3708987 i started remembering my dad did this movie called putney swope i was in new york at that time and the character was supposed to be a vietnam soldier so i was remembering some of the folks who were hanging out in the west village back then
3708988 without it being too specific i just started this gravelly cool very world weary voice and i said oh my god im going to have a ball with this
3708989 i laid the voice on stiller and he laughed and i thought you know hes just laughing to make me feel ok and then hes going to change it all when we get there
3708990 he was really improvising a lot of the time and there was a little bit of a question like is that intelligible
3708991 we did some looping too but it really was who the character was and what he was playing the idea of this australian guy playing this black guy and his interpretation of that that was always what we were satirizing the idea of to try to be taken seriously
3708992 i think this is going to be a big coming out party for him as a comedian
3708993 you knew he was a great actor with chaplin but all of the films hes made were great dramatic films this is the first one where its been full blown comedy and his skills are sharp
3708994 life is too goddamn serious things are scary i got to laugh my ass off in this movie ill take that over rocket science any day and ill certainly take that over self important dramatist

3709120 it is scandalous that we know so little about a species we are putting under such huge pressure from illegal fishing and oversized fleets
3709121 wwfs new tagging project will shed new light on tuna migratoryroutes and behaviour which will enable far more effective recovery and management plans both for the tuna and the fishery that depends on them
3709122 the plan behind this project is to fill the gap between the little we do know about bluefin behaviour in the mediterraneanand what we need to know
3709123 when we have better data we would urge fisheries decision makers to use it to make better informed choices for the management of this endangered species
3709124 the reality is sales teams are very rarely privy to the full picture all too often they are unaware of the costs of overheads the levels of debt and how their sales add up in profitability the latest figures do seem to suggest that the focus has switched from profit to sales as companies grab business almost at any cost the old adage has never been more apt sales for vanity profit is sanity
3709125 the plimsoll analysis is a tool for measuring the current economic risks as it allows companies to understand their market and their competitors better in such stretched economic conditions companies need to assess and understand who is a long term threat in the market and which companies are following an unsustainable strategy this knowledge could be the difference between spotting a potential acquisition at a bargain price and becoming one

3709129 frinsa aims to have all its product range certified sustainable by friend of the sea
3709130 we are enthusiastic of this first positive achievement consumers should know that galician mussels are produced with very low impact and in a sustainable way the friend of the sea logo will help us communicating this added value to our customers
3709131 this strategy is an important initiative which we expect to encourage the more effective utilisation of scotlands inshore marine resources particularly in the sector of shellfish cultivation that will benefit the economic and social future of rural and coastal communities where shellfish farming provides a perfect fit with crofting and other economic activities that will help to keep people in these areas
3709132 shellfish cultivation which in scotland means mussels oysters and scallops has long been regarded as the cinderella of the scottish aquaculture sector this pejorative view is not reflected in many other countries both within the european community and elsewhere where shellfish farming is given significant government support in light of the natural fecundity of scottish waters which have an estimated potential annual output of 100 000 tonnes of cultivated molluscs combined with the relative absence of pollution in the optimal growing areas we hope that this poor relation perception will be corrected by the creation of a relevant appropriate and focussed strategic framework
3709133 the lack of environmental impact of shellfish cultivation the absence of both inputs to the marine environment and impacting discharges makes this activity a natural for the relatively unpolluted waters of scotlands coasts we hope the development of the industry will be strongly encouraged under the aegis of the renewed strategic framework
3709134 last year we produced some 140 000 tonnes of salmon worth almost 400
3709135 our farmed rainbow and brown trout industry is also worth over 10
3709136 it is clear that we need to maintain a scottish aquaculture industry
3709137 the renewed framework i am launching today seeks to modernise the
3709138 i want to see a more flexible approach for delivery through a
3709139 we must also make the best use of robust and sound science and research
3709140 with these improvements we will be able to drive forward the sustainable economic growth of an industry which is vital for scotland
3709141 we welcome the new vision and hope that it will bring greater social economic and sustainable benefits to farmers and the many remote rural businesses that are reliant on a successful salmon sector improving competitiveness and good governance will encourage further investment in the salmon industry which is key to enhancing environmental sustainability and delivering greater social and economic rewards
3709142 this is an important initiative which we expect to encourage the more effective utilisation of scotlands inshore marine resources particularly in the sector of shellfish cultivation benefiting the economic and social future of rural and coastal communities

3709178 this is going to regulate it to a 5 percent rate give the people 30 days to pay back instead of the 7 to 14 days

3709184 last years race was a great first step toward reducing our carbon footprint
3709185 with the support of our partners were expanding our efforts beyond the carfax 250 and into the nascar sprint cup series to continue that success we realize theres a lot of work still to be done but its important that people see how easy it is to make a positive impact on global climate change
3709186 we applaud our partners shared concern for environmental issues and view their approach as one of the many options available to help mitigate environmental impacts
3709187 at mis our efforts at least initially are focused on reducing the immediate impacts from our operations and events through broad based recycling efforts partnerships with local governments and agencies to identify more efficient means of operation pursuing renewable power sources and through conservation efforts
3709188 habitat loss and climate change are two of the greatest environmental challenges of our time
3709189 now more than ever addressing these challenges will require a mix of public and private financing the fund applauds carfax for its industry leading commitment to offset the carfax 250 and its nascar sprint cup series car carfaxs support will result in the restoration of more than 4 300 trees at one of our nations most sensitive national wildlife refuges creating new wildlife habitat cleaning our air and enhancing public recreation areas we can all enjoy

3709279 what the hell you think im lookin at im lookin you you could be saddams grandma i dont know
3709280 they were expecting to beat us like 60 points or more
3709281 michael stuck his medal through the fence and we were all there it was so special
3709282 he stuck the medal through and was like look what i did i did it i
3709283 i think ive figured out michael phelps hes not from another planet hes from the future his father made him and made a time machine sixty years from now he is an average swimmer but he has come back here to mop up
3709284 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it i just have absolutely nothing to say im speechless
3709285 its a pretty cool title i guess you could say
3709286 it is very hard to be swimming the relay also on the same day as the butterfly i dont know how he is doing this
3709287 everybody is thinking how can he do this and break world record
3709288 i was trying to see the t on the bottom of the pool to try and judge my turn and the finish i was more or less just sort of counting strokes i sort of know how many strokes i take in a 50 and i was hoping i was going to be dead on and i was going to be able to hit the wall perfectly i was able to get my hand on the wall first and it was a best time but i think i was just disappointed that i know i can go faster than that
3709289 it may be once in a century we see something like this
3709290 the rest of the world is catching up to the u s the way i look at it quite a bit for him to be doing what hes doing at this moment in time with the rest of the world coming up the way it is i think that speaks volumes and the way hes attacking this meet too hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying every race its awesome to watch its inspiring to me
3709291 every time i watch him swim im more and more in awe of what he does
3709292 being his teammate and being part of the team while hes doing all this kind of gives us a different perspective i think years and years down the road well realize more and more how amazing and special he is
3709293 its always just one more step when youre kind of at the top of the mountain the steps are pretty high even one more step takes you pretty far away from everyone else

3709309 in a school of about 330 students we have 72 students in pre k through grade 5 whose second language is english and they come from all over china el salvador india iran ethiopia bulgaria i pull out my small groups for a half hour of english grammar and vocabulary instruction each day i love the kids and their parents are great to work with because they come from cultures that still value education they hold teachers in high esteem imagine that plus they have sacrificed so much to come here trying to find a better future for their children id never be brave enough to leave my homeland and my extended family so i admire folks who have that much courage
3709310 its about time someone else takes on this responsibility and i am happy to pass the baton onto somebody that im sure i have inspired there is nothing bad about that it is only positive hes shown a different kind of courage than i did i was not chasing seven gold medals
3709311 you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3709312 but as soon as the swimming was over and michael phelps didnt break my record every time i went to beach volley they put my face on the volleyballs
3709313 im sure he can afford a ticket if he wants to be here it would have been have nice for him to be here and witness it i really feel he contributed a lot to swimming but its time to turn the reigns over to somebody else youve got to move on with life get a life after swimming
3709314 hes almost identical to me hes a world record holder in all these events so he is dominating the events just like i did he reminds me of myself

3709361 its absolutely not going to be an easy choice and the players understand that
3709362 martin rowlands is a good player and as for dani parejo you dont play for real madrid without being a good player and his set piece delivery was sensational
3709363 i think mikele has a chance to be a top midfield player he wants to play there and hes got that solidity you cant outrun him you cant out power him and hes got two good feet
3709364 weve got another good pro in gavin mahon who played well against barnsley on saturday
3709365 ledesma has great charisma and is a fans favourite already he was the most special player i saw when i went to italy in the summer such great ability
3709366 i counted 12 good chances we had in the first half yet we found ourselves 2 1 down
3709367 but the response was very good after half time it was one way traffic
3709368 there was also a lot of resolve about it this club gave away a lot of leads last year but we hung in there
3709369 im lucky because really ive got two number one keepers
3709370 rowlys the club captain so youd think hed be in with a shout but i want to play and gav wants to play as much as we can
3709371 people are probably saying were just keeping the shirt warm but we dont look at it like that and no one in their right mind would give it up easily
3709372 last year the team almost picked itself but now with the quality of competition weve got youve got to perform well to keep your place and shied away from that
3709373 its up to all of us to do the business on the pitch and if somethings going to change itll be because its beneficial to the team
3709374 i was disappointed not to be playing last time but hopefully ill be selected for this one
3709375 i enjoyed my time living in sheffield and had a decent season but there was a change of manager and he wasnt too keen on me
3709376 sheffield united have good players they did last year and its a shame they didnt do what was expected of them but this time i think theyll give it more of a go
3709377 its going to be a difficult game but if were looking for promotion ourselves weve got to be beating teams like sheffield united
3709378 i was confident that i was going to end up at qpr
3709379 but i just got nervous about how long it was going to take
3709380 at first i thought it shouldnt be a problem but it took longer and longer and longer and somebody even told me i might miss the whole of august that wasnt a pleasant time for me
3709381 obviously i was very frustrated and i was particularly disappointed with the way they blackpool acted in this case
3709382 i dont know what it was but now im looking forward im just happy its over now and i can play for qpr
3709383 i think it should be harder this season when you look at the teams who have come up with big ambitions swansea and doncaster and also the teams who went down from the premier league
3709384 when you look at the quality of players we have we should be up there but as weve seen before it isnt always the team with better players who win the championship
3709385 we have a lot of things to work on we need to keep improving and at the end of the season see where were at i think were capable of not only the top six but winning the league
3709386 i think we started really nervous against barnsley all of us including me and we didnt play the best football we can play but as the game went on longer we performed better and better
3709387 fitz hall scored two goals on saturday maybe next time i can do something similar
3709388 i didnt really go up for corners because they had three men up front all the time but i hope i can improve that in the next few games
3709389 i personally believe we developed language because of our deep inner need to complain

3709402 as we approach this problem going forward synthetic and blended fuels even at the higher costs of standard jet fuel per barrel that were experiencing today as i understand it will be higher yet per gallon for us to operate with these synthetic fuels
3709403 so we need a market based solution across the government and across the commercial aviation sector that will help drive that change and push down the cost
3709404 we would expect that regardless of who wins in november the air force is still going to have a significant issue
3709405 trying to move anything through this year is very difficult
3709406 as far as my olympic experience goes it is everything that i wanted it to be
3709407 as far as my swimming goes i accomplished what i came here to do get a best time and i did that its difficult that i dont get to go into the final tomorrow and have a shot at a medal but i came here to do a best time and i did it i have no regrets whatsoever
3709408 and i know i am going to win that one now i can put all my energy into it fighting this battle i am going to attack it the same way i did swimming and im going to get it the hell out of me

3709421 die wirklich harten bilder haben wir rausgeschnitten die w ren zu schockierend f r den zuschauer gewesen
3709422 jeden tag verschwinden von unserer erde immer mehr tierarten mich haben orang utans nicht losgelassen in einem tierpark in bangkok werden affen als gogo girls verkleidet oder als kickboxer abgerichtet und missbraucht das ist krank
3709423 ich habe dann 2006 aus eigener tasche mit meinem kameramann einen 15 min tigen teaser finanziert und in asien gedreht
3709424 wir wussten nur dass aus dem team von willie smits drei leute auf dem tiermarkt in jakarta ermordet wurden
3709425 tierhandel ist ein milliardengesch ft das konkurriert in asien mit drogen und waffenhandel und die drahtzieher lassen sich nicht gerne filmen aber markus strobel mein kameramann hat unterarme wie ich oberschenkel der l sst sich nicht so schnell einsch chtern sonst k nnte man solche filme auch gar nicht machen
3709426 das sch ne ist doch dass es noch hoffnung gibt ich habe den film wegen willie smits gemacht der mann hat eine vision er pflanzt pro tag 1000 b ume in einem abgeholzten gebiet neu an ich habe zwei gepflanzt und war danach schwei gebadet
3709427 so ein orang utan baby ist schon knuddelig aber gleichzeitig verbirgt sich hinter jedem baby eine trag die die m tter werden von den b umen geschossen fleisch und knochen nach china importiert weil man dort glaubt es mache potent die babys st rzen mit aus der h he eines von vier oder f nf berlebt diesen sturz und dann werden sie f r viel geld verkauft

3709637 there is a sense of relief that we got through it of course there is
3709638 for the latin american and caribbean region the best outcome from the international conference on aids being held in mexico city this week august 03 08 2008 may be what happened just prior to the conference on july 31st and august 1st health and education ministers from most countries in the region came together in mexico city at the invitation of the mexican government the meeting was designed to bring together the two sectors most responsible for sex education health and education to create a declaration that specifically highlights and creates government commitments to supporting comprehensive sex education as a foundation for stemming the tide of hiv aids in the region no meeting such as this has ever occurred in the region or any other region before the seeds for such a meeting were sown several years ago when civil society organizations in mexico worked with the government entities responsible for addressing hiv aids to create a national campaign to support sex education as hiv prevention siecus reported on this work in our publication a shared border a common agenda the success of this effort highlighted the role that comprehensive sex education plays as a foundation for hiv prevention and when additional interventions are laid on top of this foundation for example in those communities with increased risk we establish a greater overarching strategy that helps get us out of the pin prick prevention that is essentially disaster aversion in mexico it is taking hold and working well the recent meeting of the ministers was an opportunity for mexico to engage the rest of the region in a dialogue to replicate and build upon the work in the country the summit consisted of two meetings one technical and one more official that involved the ministers themselves neither meeting was not without controversy several countries sought to highlight and stress the need for abstinence in the declaration other countries reacted strongly and pushed back not the least of which was brazil it is no coincidence that brazil is one of the countries that has entirely rejected u s government assistance to combat hiv aids in their own country and they did so with a clear indication that the promotion of abstinence and marriage was inconsistent with brazils own values and regard for human rights standards in the context of public health in fact one of the most startling things from this technical meeting was the utter rebuke of using the word abstinence precisely because of the bush administrations politicization of that concept while everyone obviously supports abstinence as a good option for young people many can no longer embrace the term because of the nonsense and destruction its dogged promotion has done to global hiv aids prevention efforts what a sad legacy and lesson on overreach for the bush administrations war on evidence based prevention
3709639 i read that jordan said id never really look like her as her look is unique
3709640 well id like to know when hair extensions fake t ts and fake tan became unique because its every other girl on the street

3709671 customers should not stop virtual machines keep virtual machines going until we release a patch you can also move the clock backwards on the server

3709689 i think any bloke whos honest about their lives can point to times in their lives when theyve got it wrong

3709693 a lot of people are scratching their heads trying to figure out why they bought their suvs
3709694 we both share in the idea that the more of these cars that are on the road the better
3709695 no 2 is making emissions better and using less gas
3709696 we are targeting pickups suvs and vans thats the really big market
3709697 if you start with a gas guzzler that gets 12 miles per gallon or a school bus that gets 7 miles per gallon and increase that the impact is far bigger
3709698 no matter how it turns out i think weve had an effect on
3709699 i think youll find that this is the real deal

3709705 we will carry on the luxurious visual styles of both operas dragon robes and brocades from peking opera will be presented along with the loose bodied luminous tibetan clothes
3709706 well unfortunately we are all a bit suspicious that this is actually a smoke screen to actually keep the judges out and actually play for time because this impeachment could be a drawn out process and in that there is an equal chance that musharraf might survive that because there are only about 10 members of parliament that need to go on the other side for this whole impeachment effort to fail
3709707 it would be a straightforward thing of immediately annulling nullifying musharrafs election as the president while he was still the army chief
3709708 so therefore if the judges were restored then musharraf would go but they the ruling coalition are not restoring the judges and instead going the wrong way round
3709709 he zardari has been given amnesty off all his corruption cases worth billions of dollars and in return the quid pro quo is that zardari saves musharraf and rather than getting the judges reinstated if he were sincere he would just get the judges reinstated who are still the constitutional judges of pakistan but he is stalling on that he is making every excuse not to get the judgesack
3709710 our history shows that once the army chief retires which musharraf did last november then its case of the king is dead long live the king and they serve their own institution i dont think they are going to stand by him
3709711 i find the whole thing quite strange that the isi is supposed to be patronizing these militants on the other hand these militants have been killing not just the soldiers and police but actually they have blown up two isi buses killing isi personnel right in the heart of the ghq in pindi
3709712 in my opinion what is a more accurate picture is that the militant groups that were trained by the cia and isi during the afghan jihad against the soviets and who after the soviet occupation the groups that were used by isi in kashmir and afghanistan they have gone out of control or the ideological element in these groups has gone out of control because they were indoctrinated to fight foreign occupation
3709713 they backed one man against 160 million people and they kept backing him right through all the unconstitutional acts he kept doing they still kept backing him they backed him they paid lip service to him that he shouldnt have imposed the emergency but when the illegal and unconstitutional election was announced they quickly backed him again
3709714 the us standing with the military dictator has actually harmed the image of the us it has raised anti americanism in our country because here the people who were watching a military dictator using the army to kill their own people
3709715 now it is the most rugged mountainous terrain so for any pakistan head of state giving any guarantees to the us that they will be able to stop these tribes half are on one side of the border half are on the other side and there is no border theres never been a border the way to have tackled it was through dialogue through winning the tribesman over to their side
3709716 the tribes have nothing to do with al qaeda or taliban they should have won them over to their side rather than indiscriminately bombing them aerial bombing bombs not knowing or differentiating between women children and terrorists and the collateral damage pushing the tribes on to the other side and its a huge mess being created their and they need to change strategy
3709717 my advice is that they need to change strategy we dont want more of the same its a failed strategy and my advice to them is to study the rand corporation report that says that only eight percent of terrorist conflicts have been resolved through military terrorism is an idea you dont win this war on terror if you dont win the hearts and minds of people the more people die the more people join the terrorists
3709718 shes great shes also 22 years old i think people forget that

3709739 i have a question that ive never really heard discussed anywhere why does anyone want to have a second child full never been one of those women who desperately want to have kids until i married my husband i would have been fine not having any and even then i would have been fine adopting my husband was adopted so he really wanted to have a biological child and we decided to go for it i told him then that wed have one and see how it went i had a fairly easy pregnancy as pregnancies go but hated pretty much 95 of those 10 months i had a home birth which im quite glad about though it was a long labor our son who is now 24 weeks old is perfectly healthy the happiest little boy ive ever seen and really rather easy i was thrown for a loop over how much time and energy and self sacrifice was and is required but not to the point of ppd and ive been seeing a therapist for awhile because i was a bit worried about that i returned to work at 3 months and am now working full time i love my son more than anything in the world but my husband is already talking about child 2 and i absolutely cannot imagine going through this again much less going through it again while having child 1 i was ready for him to get a vasectomy the day after i gave birth i didnt like being pregnant i never want to be this sleep deprived again ive always needed me time and am having a hard enough time getting that now i realized the other day that i might feel a bit differently if i didnt have to work fulltime but theres no option about that im also amazed at the number of people who automatically assume were going to have at least one more child part of me thinks that im being smart at realizing my limitations but part of me of course feels guilty and selfish so i guess im just wondering is there anyone else out there that feels this way

3709786 president obama and first lady as seen from the right wing point of view
3709787 this cartoon is intended to make fun of conservatives as ignorant racists and essentially marginalize any criticism of obama as moronic
3709788 its not a satire about obama its a satire about the distortions and misconceptions and prejudices about obama
3709789 its the mass media at its worst it perpetuates false information and its highly inflammatory it gives credibility to whats been circulating for months and thats what makes it dangerous

3709795 the bottom line is that the iranians are tweaking our noses
3709796 and as a direct result of u n sanctions irans ability to procure technology or items of significance to its missile programs even dual use items is being impaired

3709833 night after night have i sung of him though i knew him not night after night have i told his story to the stars and now i see him his hair is dark as the hyacinth blossom and his lips are red as the rose of his desire but passion has made his face like pale ivory and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow
3709834 and my love will be of the company if i bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn if i bring her a red rose i shall hold her in my arms and she will lean her head upon my shoulder and her hand will be clasped in mine but there is no red rose in my garden so i shall sit lonely and she will pass me by she will have no heed of me and my heart will break
3709835 what i sing of he suffers what is joy to me to him is pain surely love is a wonderful thing it is more precious than emeralds and dearer than fine opals pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it nor is it set forth in the marketplace it may not be purchased of the merchants nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold
3709836 and play upon their stringed instruments and my love will dance
3709837 as white as the foam of the sea and whiter than the snow upon the mountain but go to my brother who grows round the old sun dial and perhaps he will give you what you want
3709838 as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe but go to my brother who grows beneath the students window and perhaps he will give you what you want
3709839 as red as the feet of the dove and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean cavern but the winter has chilled my veins and the frost has nipped my buds and the storm has broken my branches and i shall have no roses at all this year
3709840 only one red rose is there no way by which i can get it
3709841 but it is so terrible that i dare not tell it to you
3709842 you must build it out of music by moonlight and stain it with your own you must sing to me with your breast against a thorn all night long you must sing to me and the thorn must pierce your heart and your life blood must flow into my veins and become mine
3709843 death is a great price to pay for a red rose
3709844 and life is very dear to all it is pleasant to sit in the green wood and to watch the sun in his chariot of gold and the moon in her chariot of pearl sweet is the scent of the hawthorn and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley and the heather that blows on the hill yet love is better than life and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man
3709845 be happy you shall have your red rose i will build it out of music by moonlight and stain it with my own all that i ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover for love is wiser than philosophy though she is wise and mightier than power though he is mighty flame coloured are his wings and coloured like flame is his body his lips are sweet as honey and his breath is like frankincense
3709846 or the day will come before the rose is finished
3709847 or the day will come before the rose is finished
3709848 you said that you would dance with me if i brought you a red rose
3709849 here is the reddest rose in all the world you will wear it to night next your heart and as we dance together it will tell you how i love you
3709850 i am afraid it will not go with my dress
3709851 and besides the chamberlains nephew has sent me some real jewels and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers
3709852 it is not half as useful as logic for it does not prove anything and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen and making one believe things that are not true in fact it is quite unpractical and as in this age to be practical is everything i shall go back to philosophy and study metaphysics

3709862 de eerste barbie komt uit 1959 het was iets unieks in de speelgoedhistorie het was de eerste volwassen pop voor kinderen tot die tijd waren poppen altijd babies en kinderen meisjes moesten later moeder worden dus die poppen waren eigenlijk om mee te oefenen speelgoedmaker mattel brak daarmee en kwam met barbie die trouwens in vernoemd naar de dochter van de maker die barbara heette
3709863 het idee was niet helemaal nieuw barbie is eigenlijk afgekeken van lilli dat was een duitse pop die er bijna hetzelfde uitzag maar dan voor volwassenen de pop lillie was weer gebaseerd op de lilli strips in de krant bild lilli was echt een sekssymbool
3709864 dat is heel raar mannen die modelautootjes of treintjes sparen dat is heel normaal als je als volwassene barbies nog steeds leuk vindt dan ben je kinderachtig dat begrijp ik niet zo goed maar ik trek me er weinig van aan op de middelbare school heb ik al mijn barbies wel een tijdje opgeruimd onder mom van ik vind ze niet leuk meer maar dat vond ik wel ik durfde dat alleen niet te zeggen ik was blij dat ik een klein nichtje had waarvoor ik af en toe eens iets van barbie kon kopen
3709865 klopt je kunt het complete modebeeld volgen elk jaar verschijnt er een nieuwe kledinglijn van barbie die hobbelt meestal wel een jaartje achter de echte mode aan maar toch krijg je een mooi beeld van wat mensen modieus vonden
3709866 ja al heeft het niet altijd te maken met het modebeeld maar ook met wat politiek correct is door ophef in amerika over anorexia heeft haar wespetaille een natuurlijke vorm gekregen discussies over borstvergrotingen zorgden voor een kleinere borstomvang maar ook barbies uitstraling is aangepast in de jaren zestig vonden ze een getuit mondje verleidelijk misschien was dat te sexy nu heeft barbie een vriendelijke glimlach

3709950 i learned a lot from letterman and leno while living in the states
3709951 that was the first time chinese people as a whole stood up to the world
3709952 its good for chinese people that incident proves that when chinese are upset they can find their voice
3709953 no less jingoistic than those who have never gone abroad
3709954 a significant proportion of them believe that using force to promote chinas national interests is acceptable
3709955 it means the post 1989 policy to imbue youth with nationalism through patriotic education has succeeded
3709956 they felt the most important thing was to help chinese education they wanted to teach
3709957 people say dai qings stupid after 20 years of going overseas she doesnt even have a green card
3709958 to be honest when we go abroad we do find people asking strange questions like whether china has modern buildings or cars
3709959 sometimes its hard not to feel they have some bias
3709960 theyre being anti western to feel attached to their own country
3709961 as soon as they get online they can be totally immersed in a chinese environment
3709962 when we were studying abroad occasionally you went to chinatown to read a chinese paper now if youre in the u k you can easily not read english papers or watch english tv
3709963 young chinese feel they have the right to speak out about anything
3709964 this generation doesnt want to accept any ideological message whether its from the communist party or voice of america

3709970 i listen to radio stations and we know what you media report
3709971 we must ask who is ready for reconciliation there have been 14 national peace conferences and i attended 12 of the conferences
3709972 we did not come here the somali presidency by military force but through a vote
3709973 189 mps out of a 275 seat parliament voted for me
3709974 we president yusuf and then prime minister ali m gedi both attended the khartoum talks to show the world we wanted peace
3709975 they islamic courts attacked jowhar hiiraan galgaduud and went near galkayo in puntland but we had a ceasefire agreement still after all those mistakes we went back to khartoum a second time but there was no understanding
3709976 we tfg did not attack but how many sides did they islamic courts attack baidoa from
3709977 the government has the right to self defense the other group islamic courts had foreigners terrorists of all colors among them
3709978 they islamic courts began attacking the government and its allies and in kismayo the government was overthrown
3709979 the government is ready for reconciliation for power sharing because we divided it the government by clans and the opposition includes all somali clans
3709980 people with self interests are saying that i am against reconciliation
3709981 quite honestly many of our customers come to our store every day asking for it were excited were going to be able to say yes
3709982 no he isnt the guy who talks to dead people
3709983 we cant put our leaders on a pedestal they make mistakes
3709984 i knew i was behind spains alberto contador by a few seconds we had to decide on gearing in the end i wish i would have chosen a different gear thats my style i finished strong i medaled im happy i wish i felt that strong a little earlier in the race
3709985 i definitely pictured it i pictured myself on the top step its fantastic to win a medal you hear people say gold silver bronze its all good its a fantastic feeling whether or not you win gold silver or bronze its the olympics its important
3709986 i think there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic director picked the best voice and the best performer
3709987 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great
3709988 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
3709989 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3709990 i dont agree with the decision because they are kids and it may scar them for life
3709991 i think the girl with the voice should have a chance to perform at the closing ceremonies it would be a great chance for her to redeem herself to the world
3709992 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3709993 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3709994 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3709995 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3709996 there is nobody in our sport that can win like he wins
3709997 he is not just winning he is crunching world records
3709998 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3709999 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
