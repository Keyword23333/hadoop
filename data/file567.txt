5670015 just hard baseball thats all but i thought the other slide by schierholtz was too high in the states you try to do that youre ejected he ejected me from the game and the umpire let the game get away thats all there was to it
5670016 i figured thered be a play and he blocked the plate so i did what i had to do to score the run
5670017 it was a close game at the time and weve been playing close games so i knew we needed the run i wasnt trying to take him out
5670018 my left shoulders still bad from having to run over catchers that were in front of home plate
5670019 you slide into them theyve got shin guards thats even worse
5670020 it was pretty brutal to throw at a guys head
5670021 we would have charged for sure no question you hit five guys and you hit one of our leaders youre gonna pay for it but its a little different here i guess the tempers were high and i dont know what the implications for everything are here

5670063 my favorite tarot card the fool known by some as
5670064 and yet in moments like these i discover my capacity for flight gravity or at least gravitas bounds the body in space but it fails to ground the spirit in its flight toward some higher truth if we avoid becoming overly gnostic about its significance
5670065 at the center of this labyrinth at the heart of the religious belief which could perhaps be called eschatism lies the ever approaching terminal date even if it is allowed that this event has some exterior reality that time can end even that the time of that ending can be known it still seems unreasonably close at hand the eschaton of the maya and end of everything as a digital hourglass will most certainly cast a new light on everything
5670066 the theory of intelligent design id claims that life and living things show signs of having been designed by an intelligent agent
5670067 it is a collection of simulated relatives which has been growing continually since 1996 a series of images represented by real individuals from the past are transferred and transformed throughout time and analysed by human faculty and machine capability artificial models of personality are leading a never ending battle between feelings and technology beauty and ugliness this can be read as a metaphor or as a fact
5670068 the word consciousness in the previous section has the same fundamental description as those esoteric versions given for the christian godhead the jewish yahweh the muslim allah and the hindu brahmin accordingly the reader is free to use whichever word he she prefers in this modern creation story in the above description a living aware being was essential for creation to happen this gives man an essential functioning role in the workings of the universe it contrasts with the prior despiriting scientific view from isaac newton wherein all was predictable in the world and neither man or god had a role to play so science agrees with the mystics that god created the world but not in six days and not in the past instead creation happens every moment of our waking lives and we are essential in the process consider this however humans may not be the only beings that manifest reality by their observations animals plants all distinguish between themselves and the environment and they demonstrate their awareness through their responsiveness to that environment so they must all be both conscious and aware though of course to quite widely varying degrees apparently they share in creating the world with you even though the world they observe may be quite different from yours
5670069 in this note we discuss the intriging possiblity whether we could be in fact in a large civilization without being aware of it our conclusion is that this possibility cannot be ruled out provided two conditions are met that we call the subanthropic principle and the undetectability conjecture the subanthropic principle states that we are not typical among the intelligent observers from the universe typical civilizations of typical galaxies would be hundreds of thousands or millions of years more evolved than ours and consequently typical intelligent observers would be orders of magnitude more intelligent than us the undetectability conjecture states that generically all advanced civilizations camouflage their planets for security reasons so that can be detected by external observers who would only obtain distorted data for disuasion purposes
5670070 we live in an unprecedented time in the evolutionary history on planet earth the human species has gained powers great enough to destroy our world or to co create a vastly better future for all earth life through science and technology we are probing into the invisible processes of creation the atom the gene the brain we are learning to place human intent into matter we are participating in the evolution of evolution from unconscious to conscious choice from natural selection to selection according to human purpose those of us alive today are the first generation born with the choice of learning conscious ethical evolution or suffering devolution and the destruction of our life support systems with unimaginably more tragedy than the world has yet experienced we do not have much time within the next 30 to 50 years we must change our fundamental behavior to be more in alignment with our natural systems and our visions of a positive future never before has the human species had to change this quickly in order to survive
5670071 we are particularly interested in studying ndes that may bear on the question of whether the mind can function outside the physical body and on whether we may survive bodily death one such type of experience is the so called in which experiencers acquire verifiable information that they could not have obtained by any normal means for example some experiencers report seeing events going on at some distant location such as another room of the hospital or an experiencer might meet a deceased loved one who then communicates verifiable information the experiencer had not known other kinds of ndes that may bear on the mind body question include those in which mental functioning seems to be enhanced despite physiological evidence that the brain is impaired
5670072 our planet is headed into an accelerating crisis ecologically speaking it is a meltdown defined by the sixth mass extinction the destruction of the planets last wilderness areas and the forced assimilation of the planets few remaining earth centered cultures corporate capitalisms inherent drive towards global domination has literally pushed the life support systems of the planet to the point of collapse so lets begin our analysis by asking ourselves an often unanswered question why has the radical ecology movement failed to capture the imagination of the american public for more than the proverbial 15 minutes why in america the engine of consumption which drives the system of global destruction isnt there more visible resistance to the suicidal direction of the corporatized consumer society one easy culprit is the environmental movements failure to weave our range of issues into a holistic analysis story about the type of cultural transformation needed to address the ecological crisis
5670073 the great story also known as the universe story or

5670075 earth had a challenging childhood through its first several hundred million birthdays the only birthday present earth could expect to receive was another big asteroid impact boom torched again you see the solar system was a messy place some four billion years ago there were little space rocks big asteroids and icy comets everywhere until the planets fully used their gravitational attractions to pull in and sweep up the debris cluttering their orbits it was just one darn asteroid impact after another but was it really a bad day for planet earth whenever an asteroid collided was it really a bad day when an uninvited visitor from space set off another humungous earthquake that shook the planet like jelly setting off scores of volcanic eruptions that drowned the surface in fresh lava consider these very same asteroids were what helped earth acquire its great mass from the very beginning earth was built from scratch from colliding asteroids there was no earth no mars no venus until asteroids started coming together but come together they did earth grew bigger and bigger and bigger as the asteroids crashed in from all directions boom boom boom

5670088 basically i had a choice of either going out there and having a go or hanging back and trying to pick up places on the run i opted for the former i was loving every minute of it now im looking towards london 2012 when ill have four years of extra maturity behind me
5670089 on thursday i felt ill quite badly and was in bed for a day with sickness but ive felt pretty good for the past few days
5670090 i got the all clear from the doctor to compete today and i felt ok during the warm up obviously the nerves were there with it being the olympic games i swam ok but i was lacking that extra five per cent and coming into the transition i was at the back
5670091 i was with some good cyclists and i thought i could make it up but as they went up the hill they put the hammer down and i just had nothing left in my legs
5670092 the officials pulled me off the course towards the end of the bike which would have been a safety issue i always wanted to finish but i can understand you cannot have runners and cyclists potentially taking each other out
5670093 so i came off 100m from the end of the bike i trained so hard for this obviously it wasnt the way i wanted it to go but i gave it 100 per cent today theres nothing i can really say its hard to describe how i feel im gutted
5670094 it was really tough out there i was very down on the swim so i had to work hard to chase on the bike which at this level is not good youve always got to be at the front saving yourself
5670095 i wasnt swimming fast enough ive been running really well in training ive been in my best ever shape but i didnt really do myself justice
5670096 i will improve my swimming and come back better but hopefully in london it will be a lot easier and the conditions will suit me a lot more
5670097 while the evolutionists and the creationists have been battling it out through dramatic episodes of the scopes soaps another explanatory paradigm has been developing exponentially which subsumes corrects and makes obsolete specifically relative to the human species both of those rather primitive paradigms
5670098 many scholars have shed much ink trying to decide what the meaning of sacrifice is
5670099 i see three meanings in indo european sacrifice the shared meal the ghosti relationship and the relationship with chaos lets look at each of them in turn
5670100 the shared meal is the simplest and most obvious of the three
5670101 this leads us to the next meaning the ghosti relationship
5670102 human society at the present moment is not in the darkness of oblivion it has made rapid progress in the field of material comforts education and economic development throughout the entire world but there is a pinprick somewhere in the social body at large and therefore there are large scale quarrels even over less important issues there is need of a clue as to how humanity can become one in peace friendship and prosperity with a common cause srimad bhagavatam will fill this need for it is a cultural presentation for the respiritualization of the entire human society

5670209 this is not just a collaboration on training but a demonstration of how private public partnerships should work
5670210 as amref builds kenyattas capacity for training the hospital will become a resource centre for other hospitals to train nurses and other health workers in a similar manner across the country
5670211 the hospitals mandate is to provide specialised healthcare and to provide facilities for training of health workers besides helping the government to formulate health policy
5670212 the hospital is also involved in research and all these areas give us greater scope for collaboration with amref
5670213 kenyatta national hospital has become a victim of its own success
5670214 people leave hospitals and clinics in their districts and come to us for treatment causing congestion and stretching the staff and facilities that we have
5670215 early childhood care and education ecce should be the bedrock of the nations education programme if we are to attain the objectives of ube

5670218 the curriculum has been printed and disseminated free to all public schools nationwide
5670219 this is to facilitate its smooth implementation simultaneously in primary and junior secondary schools

5670226 official legislative documents released this week show that obama in fact presided over a committee hearing where
5670227 there are major differences in state and federal bills including the fact that the federal bill included a neutrality clause
5670228 the obama campaign thinks if they continue to repeat their flimsy story about barack obamas opposition to the common sense born alive infant protection act that their thin explanation will become true the reality is that actual legislative records directly contradict their story
5670229 heres the truth barack obama killed the commonsense born alive infant protection act in the illinois senate and his campaign continues its game of hide and seek thats because his position is heartless there is no baby at any stage even born accidentally that he finds worth protecting where is his heart for the downtrodden when it comes to the most vulnerable human beings it is no wonder he cannot admit to the truth of his leadership as a state senator

5670239 likewise afghanistans president hamid karzai has for quite some time charged pakistan with fomenting the jihad against his regime
5670240 weakening the isi would also weaken the war on terror
5670241 it was emblematic of the double game musharraf appears to have played since the beginning of his regime paying lip service to his alliance with the west and his commitment to anti terror efforts while doing little or nothing to root out sympathizers with the global jihad at the highest levels of the pakistani government and acquiescing to the establishment of a taliban like regime in pakistans north west frontier province

5670257 it is undeniable that iraq is in a much better place than it was several months ago
5670258 an increasingly effective iraqi security force one that is growing in capability and in confidence
5670259 and as a result we have seen signs of hope and prosperity return to many parts of the country that were once previously threatened by criminals and terrorists and others who dont want iraq to achieve its full potential
5670260 were making progress in each of these areas every day
5670261 and while these efforts are progressing at a different pace they all are moving forward in a positive and tangible manner
5670262 today the multinational corps iraq is operating in more areas of the country with fewer troops and our security gains continue to trend in a positive direction even after the redeployment of five brigade combat teams and most recently the georgia brigade
5670263 in the north al qaida is in disarray and its capability to conduct well planned and coordinated attacks is limited but they still pose a real threat to the population
5670264 and a couple of weeks ago i walked through an open market in mosul that was several kilometers long and it was overflowing with iraqis
5670265 now thats something that would not have been possible just a couple of months ago and this is a clear sign that we are making progress indeed
5670266 it must be nice to have all those resources or money to do that

5670285 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

5670289 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
5670290 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5670291 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5670292 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

5670327 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5670328 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5670329 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5670330 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5670331 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5670332 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5670333 we have been authorised to extend an offer to return to joint negotiations for the upcoming commercials contract under the terms of the phase one agreement
5670334 in spite of the fact that aftra did not respond prior to our july 26 2008 board meeting as we requested the sag national board of directors authorised screen actors guild to participate in a phase one joint negotiation
5670335 this complaint arises from sags wholesale attempts to eliminate aftra as a bargaining representative for actors by launching a massive campaign to defeat the ratification of a national collective bargaining agreement negotiated by aftra
5670336 we are certainly willing to engage with aftra in discussions with the afl cio about the ongoing relationship of our organisations

5670362 business wise its like renting space on an empty 18 wheeler after youve dropped off your delivery the advantage to flying a charter is you dont wait in line and at many small airports limousines can drive up to the airplane
5670363 the plane i fly holds 4 500 gallons and jet fuel sells for 7 a gallon on top of that we have about 1 million in fixed costs for the one airplane the faa requires monthly inspections you cant just hang out a shingle and become a charter company
5670364 when you finally get on the plane after waiting in the long line you sit in the center seat for a four hour flight
5670365 the kid in back of you is kicking your seat you get a 5 box of snacks you wouldnt eat if it was free

5670377 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah

5670381 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5670382 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively

5670388 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5670389 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5670390 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
5670391 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
5670392 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
5670393 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
5670394 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
5670395 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
5670396 i am pleased to endorse my friend bob tuke to be the next u
5670397 but bob is more than a candidate with timely solutions to pressing problems facing our nation and our planet he is also a man of great honor and integrity bob has the life experience that we need to turn our country around as a marine combat veteran in vietnam bob led troops in battle the u s senate would be well served to have his perspective as we finally bring an end to the mismanaged war in iraq these are just a few of the reasons that i am proud to give him my full support and endorsement
5670398 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5670399 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
5670400 it says more about them than anything how they think how they envision their governing and so this is probably the most important thing they do until they show themselves in debates
5670401 theyll walk you in and theyll say ok weve got a question about your tax return or we have a question about this stock that you owned that you sold or we have a question about this speech that you gave or this vote that you took or this veto that you made
5670402 the spouses are an issue that was probably the one thing that surprised me the most is how much what your spouse has done said written makes a difference
5670403 you need to have a maximum impact around your convention when all eyes are on your party
5670404 kemp complemented dole in that he helped promote his pro growth economic ideas of cutting taxes and he also helped energize the party
5670405 anything that gets in the way that has the potential to diminish that youd rather not have
5670406 this cycle probably the best time to do it is on the friday afternoon when the democrats leave denver
5670407 why not start to squash their bounce and ride it through the weekend into minneapolis
5670408 theres a little bit of stagecraft that goes on at the end of the process to not only make sure it has an element of surprise but to really have a wow factor
5670409 there are the hard core more conservative ones who will vote for him but hold their nose
5670410 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5670411 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5670412 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
5670413 i tell people its not a wind farm its an industrial development
5670414 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5670415 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5670416 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5670417 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5670418 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5670419 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5670420 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
5670421 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5670422 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5670423 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5670424 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5670425 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5670426 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5670427 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5670428 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5670429 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5670430 were sorry but the head you are calling has been disconnected
5670431 obamas granny has selected the vp she will announce this afternoon at 5 00 pm eastern time
5670432 an indication that it could be supporters of hillary clinton who are holding out
5670433 the secret to obamas ability to make virginia a close race can be found in his ability to attract 40 of the white vote while virginias black vote will likely be less than states such as georgia or north carolina it is substantial enough that when combined with such a strong showing among whites it falls into the recipe we see as necessary for obama to win southern states that have voted republican in recent years
5670434 alaskans for obama a rare democratic push on the last frontier
5670435 obamas campaign has hit a soft patch this summer with november just three months off it still appears an obama outcome in massachusetts is not in question but the margin certainly is
5670436 in presidential politics color new york state blue and throw away the crayons
5670437 oklahomans have their minds made up and they arent going to change come hell or high water no matter what
5670438 obama and mccain are doing equally well in raiding the other partys base ten percent of 2004 kerry voters favor mccain while 13 percent of 2004 bush backers are with obama in order to close the gap mccain needs to do a little bit better winning back the democrats who voted for ronald reagan and their children
5670439 it would take an exceptional turnout from young voters and black voters as well as a lot of disaffected conservatives voting for bob barr
5670440 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5670441 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5670442 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5670443 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5670444 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis

5670446 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5670447 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
5670448 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5670449 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
5670450 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
5670451 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5670452 christopher lasch a historian and social critic was one of the first to worry that the worldview revolutions of the sixties could truly threaten peoples ability to build and lead productive unselfish adult lives
5670453 theres a place and purpose for public aggression drunkenness and lewdness
5670454 fairly well trained to spot fakery and fraud in the public realm
5670455 unfortunately civility cant be commissioned morality cant be legislated and money cant buy you love despite levels of peace and material abundance on a scale this nation had never before seen the mood grew even more sour
5670456 we will never know the answers to those questions about his life
5670457 the enemy isnt liberalism the enemy isnt conservatism the enemy is bullshit
5670458 one of the biggest reasons i left elkton hills was because i was surrounded by phonies
5670459 is to countries what self respect is to individuals a necessary condition of self improvement
5670460 and im sorry that you are just a machine because you seem so sensitive
5670461 a refreshing way to look at making necessary changes in your life
5670462 make changes that will nourish your desire spark your enthusiasm provide sensitivity to realize your true gifts
5670463 we beg to withhold participation from such a monitoring team as of now we do not think it will help fight illegal logging
5670464 das hi virus ist auf den menschen spezialisiert es kann in der m cke nicht berleben und wird von ihr einfach verdaut auf spanisch
5670465 uranium mining has taken our country away from us and destroyed it mining and the millions of dollars in royalties have not improved our quality of life
5670466 the greatest minds in the nuclear establishment have been searching for an answer to the radioactive waste problem for fifty years and theyve finally got one haul it down a dirt road and dump it on an indian reservation
5670467 for eight years in the white house every weapons proliferation problem we dealt with was connected to a civilian reactor program and if we ever got to the point where we wanted to use nuclear reactors to back out a lot of coal then wed have to put them in so many places wed run that proliferation risk right off the reasonability scale
5670468 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5670469 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5670470 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5670471 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5670472 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5670473 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5670474 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5670475 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
5670476 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
5670477 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5670478 get it off the air and i really mean it
5670479 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5670480 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5670481 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5670482 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5670483 i am married to the next president of the united states
5670484 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5670485 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5670486 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5670487 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5670488 it may give more choice in the primary election but less choice in the general election and thats where we elect our leaders were not sure what the disease is but the cure is obviously worse than the disease
5670489 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5670490 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5670491 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5670492 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5670493 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5670494 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5670495 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5670496 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5670497 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5670498 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5670499 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5670500 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5670501 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5670502 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5670503 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5670504 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5670505 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5670506 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5670507 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5670508 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5670509 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5670510 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5670511 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5670512 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5670513 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5670514 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5670515 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5670516 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5670517 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5670518 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5670519 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5670520 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5670521 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5670522 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5670523 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5670524 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5670525 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5670526 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5670527 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5670528 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5670529 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5670530 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5670531 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5670532 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5670533 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5670534 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5670535 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5670536 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5670537 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5670538 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5670539 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5670540 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5670541 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5670542 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5670543 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5670544 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5670545 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5670546 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5670547 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5670548 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5670549 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5670550 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5670551 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5670552 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5670553 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5670554 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5670555 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5670556 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5670557 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5670558 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5670559 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5670560 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5670561 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5670562 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5670563 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5670564 our early start means were not facing the same compliance costs others in the sector are facing under the national greenhouse and energy reporting act
5670565 instead were focusing on the commercial opportunities for us rather than dealing with the compliance costs
5670566 were well positioned to make money from carbon markets which is simply an extension of our energy trading business
5670567 we have a solid understanding of the market and how to help our customers
5670568 the train has left the station on this and there will be severe repercussions for those who fail to see the inevitable coming
5670569 no one says its easy but carbon will have to be managed as just another business issue
5670570 we understood what it meant to measure our carbon footprint it was extremely difficult to get landlords to change their behaviour
5670571 we ended up spending the money ourselves to install sensors in offices change our light bulbs and employ our own cleaners so we could recycle
5670572 it was also a challenge convincing suppliers that we were serious about the carbon impact of production processes in our purchasing decisions
5670573 we made a conscious decision to pay more for more efficiently produced consumables and to include the long term carbon impact in equipment running costs
5670574 tnt has the largest fleet of diesel electric vehicles in australia we bought the whole production line from japan of 10 vehicles last year but we have 1500 trucks in our fleet
5670575 so its going to be some time before our suppliers can produce enough trucks to satisfy the demand
5670576 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5670577 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5670578 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5670579 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5670580 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5670581 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5670582 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
5670583 i just feel so sorry because there were so many people supporting me i told myself i had to run but i just couldnt do it
5670584 please believe that the hurt and sadness in my heart cannot be smaller than yours
5670585 at the same time please believe i am the same liu xiang as before
5670586 it was unbearable if i had finished the race i would have risked my tendon i could not describe my feeling at that moment
5670587 i never quit easily i am not that type of person
5670588 there will be more opportunities next year there will be more opportunities later i must be optimistic i cant complain about destiny
5670589 im one that cant accept failure easily i will rise up its in my character
5670590 to withdraw from a race is not to give up liu xiang had no choice and this was a moment of great courage
5670591 we gave the guys some time off this weekend and the morning practice wasnt quite where i wanted it to be but they really came out this afternoon
5670592 we ended with a two minute segment that went really well there was some good stuff that came out of the last 15 minutes of practice right there
5670593 probably be touch and go for up to the game
5670594 hopefully thursday and friday hell be involved in some sort of practice situation
5670595 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5670596 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision
5670597 in an irony sure to set blogger hearts beating giddily the film graces the cover of ews new fall preview issue
5670598 ew and warner bros share a parent company but they clearly do not share you know important information
5670599 toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over
5670600 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
5670601 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
5670602 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
5670603 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5670604 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5670605 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5670606 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5670607 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5670608 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5670609 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
5670610 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
5670611 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
5670612 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
5670613 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
5670614 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5670615 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country

5670629 any parties held at the property would cause noise nuisance to neighbours and substantially increased the risk of injury potentially fatal to revellers
5670630 this incident should send a clear message to owners of properties of the inherent risks of leaving them empty for long periods of time especially if members of the public can easily gain access

5670645 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5670646 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5670647 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values

5670650 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5670651 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5670652 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5670653 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
5670654 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
5670655 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
5670656 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
5670657 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
5670658 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
5670659 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

5670732 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
5670733 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions
5670734 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them

5670747 people are starting to go directly to the website or use bookmarks if they know what theyre looking for rather than using a portal and if they dont know where to find it theyre going to use a search engine google is best positioned to take advantage of this trend while the rest are struggling to maintain relevancy
5670748 the increase in overall e business satisfaction is driven largely by a remarkable jump by google but tough economic conditions may be contributing to greater satisfaction with the sector

5670851 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5670852 it is premature for the institution to comment on a subject that has such far reaching ramifications as with all issues that affect the lives of students washington university is prepared to learn more about both sides which requires substantial study and deliberation
5670853 i think its very important that this issue has good debate and dialogue
5670854 i think its important for us as a society to weigh how we want to move forward on this
5670855 on a personal level i certainly think that if a young person is able to serve their country and sign legal contracts and go to prison that it seems to me that they should also have a right to have a drink
5670856 i think you need a lot of research and analysis about student behavior to make a decision
5670857 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5670858 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5670859 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
5670860 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
5670861 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
5670862 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5670863 signs of not getting enough sleep or sleeping poorly include consistently taking more than 30 minutes to fall asleep awakening more than a few times or for long periods each night feeling sleepy during the day or having trouble concentrating at school or at work

5670880 there are a lot of different ways to get what you want but they usually boil down to either a form of seduction or rape
5670881 the inbev deal kept getting sweeter until anheuser busch decided to hop into bed with the belgis so that was a sort of seduction thing russia taking georgia and now setting up the ukraine is rape being followed by premeditated intent to rape again either approach can be successful both can be messy depending on how theyre handled and whether another suitor intervenes or the target is willing and able to break away personally i think a little of both keeps things interesting
5670882 you can do whatever you want if youre consenting adults but on no occasion should coercion entrapment or forcible rape be condoned in civil society or by the international community
5670883 you can question whether its right that a ceo of a company gets a multi million dollar windfall for helping another firm takeover the corporation he works for and if it was actually a set up so that in reality the ceo became an insider agent for the buyer but at least the shareholders had a chance to say no if they wanted the folks in georgia not only couldnt say no theyve been forcibly taken and are battered and bruised and have citizens dead today because russia decided they were going to come and take what they wanted thats wrong

5670885 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5670886 the notion that theres some kind of standard of good behavior within and around humankind and that some sort of moral or ethical absolute exists which people and countries should adhere to is religious and philosophical clap trap and is unsupported by evolutionary theory
5670887 there are no laws of fair play or good behavior except those that people make up rape crushing other countries beheading people you disagree with these are all normal occurrences taking place as the result of somebody wanting to do something and having the power to do it doing it or stopping it is irrelevant sure society breaks into chaotic disorder but thats natural too humans are always trying to act against their instincts to destroy and take what they want and have invented the notions of civil society and rule of law theyre all meaningless unless you really dont want to act like animals or end up in hell like me by the way you dont think you can get me back alive on earth do you id kind of like another shot at this religious youll go to hell if you dont do what god says stuff there might be something to it

5670900 it is very difficult for us to live with what has been dished out to us
5670901 all the countries have been invited after each match to put a report forward on every referee where they have got concerns
5670902 countries like england wales argentina and many others have all spent time after games submitting very mature reports that is very valuable to us
5670903 however i have yet to hear from the south africans all season there is a medium to go through and that is me but i have no sympathy for a coach that wants to go through the media rather than me
5670904 i will be meeting peter de villiers later in the month and if he has any grievances he will have a chance to bring them to me
5670905 they the referees should not be open to public enquiry just because coaches have their own agenda
5670906 captains dont have the right to question decisions but matfield was questioning almost every one and arguing
5670907 matt goddards lack of experience counted against him he should have stopped it its disturbing to see players disputing every decision they cant do that they are delaying the opposition and in a lot of cases it is done deliberately to slow the opposition down its got to be stamped out
5670908 i agree we have to be tougher we would like to see referees be a lot stronger in taking more sanctions against repeat offenders otherwise the players will say to themselves this is great we can get away with this
5670909 but the teeth the law has got is the option of a yellow or red card to sanction people that wont comply you go from a penalty to a yellow card to make sure the laws work otherwise teams will keep doing this all day

5670912 it is a fantastic challenge at a very exciting company it will be a challenge working in a new medium with a dynamic group of people
5670913 i should think lord rothermere will be more surprised than anyone there is no question that this is an inspired move by global radio
5670914 the industry view was that when he came back he was being groomed for the top
5670915 miron is not a man who makes impetuous decisions he will be a bigger fish in a smaller pond at global radio and he can perhaps be more entrepreneurial and have more scope and influence
5670916 commerical nous is commercial nous and miron is a very very good operator
5670917 he will bring great commercial gravitas to the organisation he is very ambitious and he wouldnt move unless global radios ambitions matched his
5670918 he makes things happen this is fantastic news for radio they have done brilliantly to get him he will pick radio up by the scruff of the neck
5670919 it is well known how well remunerated he was at associated
5670920 good planning is borderless and it was unfortunate an imaginary municipal border seems to have made the difference in this case
5670921 too high too intensive and does not provide adequate setbacks or buffers to adjacent uses

5670952 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5670953 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5670954 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5670955 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5670956 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5670957 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5670958 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5670959 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane

5670969 clinton has a wealth of experience and what we are looking from him is that leadership as well as knowledge about the elvs ed odonoghue is also an experienced guy who has been about a bit and is an abrasive player we were pleased with the performance on friday against bath but we have a lot of work still to do and these friendlies are a great opportunity to see how the players are progressing and give the younger guys a chance as well the magners league is just weeks away an d we are determined to make a vast improvement on our results from last season we didnt have a good time last season winning the magners league and getting to the knock out stages of europe isnt beyond this squad

5671352 delay derails the administration of justice it postpones the rectification of wrong and the vindication of the unjustly prosecuted it crowds the dockets of the courts increasing the costs for all litigants pressuring judges to take short cuts interfering with the prompt and deliberate disposition of those causes in which all parties are diligent and prepared for trial and overhanging the entire process with the pall of disorganization and insolubility
5671353 during the contest we were also watching the olympics and we were aware of what was happening there

5671355 we only knew we would miss the awarding on the first day of the competition there was only one ferry that left for hong kong that morning and we had to catch our flight
5671356 its the first time for the philippines to have such high scores in a math competition it shows we are getting better and better in math im hoping we bring home the gold next year
5671357 being a participant in this competition is already a prestige and getting a medal means that our delegates are mentally capable to compete with other contestants it is very difficult to get even a bronze medal here because this contest is good only for those who really excel in math

5671370 restructuring medicare health care and social security as well as constraining spending
5671371 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5671372 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5671373 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5671374 everybody in this room could be donating to some other cause or to their own well being but i want to thank you
5671375 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5671376 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5671377 before the obama campaign launches attacks they should stop and think about the amount of money that has been raised through convicted criminal and longtime fundraiser tony rezko
5671378 it takes a lot of audacity for obama and his spokespeople to criticize john mccain when obama was involved in a questionable home purchase with rezkos wife and years of friendship and dealings with a man convicted of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery
5671379 you know long waits for health care and some services not even available
5671380 whoever the next president is health care should be at the top of his agenda bring everyone to the table and make it happen
5671381 we have safely placed sen mccain in a cone of silence
5671382 now my first question was the cone of silence comfortable that you were in just now
5671383 of course 300 isnt going to go very far im not sure its of any real benefit

5671434 while i had listened to several of the bats casts over the last year it is only when you consume one sometimes two a day over the course of a week that you really begin to get the wow factor of all the bat has time to do i mean the intros alone are sort of other worldly

5671545 the improvement signals that fear about an economic downturn among financial market experts is contained the recent fall in the price of oil and the weakening of the euro against the dollar must have dampened economic concerns about the economy
5671546 market experts have not been particularly taken aback by the negative growth rate of the second quarter they expect weaker but all in all solid economic conditions and do not fear a recession
5671547 both oil and the euro have only simply corrected their sharp advance of recent months and both have made strong gains year on year i e are still a strain on the economy
5671548 easing pressure from oil and the euro will probably not be sufficient in themselves to trigger a renewed upswing
5671549 it has become crystal clear that markedly slower growth lies ahead as the negative momentum from the global economy is increasingly carrying over into germany
5671550 the euro dollar exchange rate and the oil price might dampen the slowdown but certainly cannot prevent it

5671565 eat food not too much mostly plants that more or less is the short answer to the supposedly incredibly complicated and confusing question of what we humans should eat in order to be maximally healthy i hate to give the game away right here at the beginning of a whole book devoted to the subject eating a little meat isnt going to kill you though it might be better approached as a side dish than as a main youre better off eating whole fresh foods rather than process food products
5671566 my aim in this book is to help us reclaim our health and happiness as eaters to do this requires an exercise that might at first blush seem unnecessary if not absurd to offer a defense of food and the eating thereof but i contend that most of what were consuming today is no longer strictly speaking food at all and how were consuming it in the car in front of the tv and increasingly alone is not really eating at least not in the sense that civilization has long understood the term
5671567 but who knows what else is going on deep in the soul of the carrot the good news is that to the carrot eater it doesnt matter thats the great thing about eating foods as compared with nutrients you dont need to fathom a carrots complexity in order to reap its benefits
5671568 a diet based on quantity rather than quality has ushered a new creature onto the world stage the human being who manages to be both overfed and undernourished
5671569 food consists not just in piles of chemicals it also comprises a set of social and ecological relationships reaching back to the land and outward to other people

5671572 i have concluded that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor
5671573 i look forward to advising boris on an ongoing basis on transport
5671574 i agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor
5671575 we have therefore decided to adjust the management structure and abolish that position
5671576 over the last few weeks it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be take are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge there are limits therefore to what can be delegated
5671577 to lose one adviser is unfortunate to lose two is careless but to lose three in four months shows the wheels are coming off this new administration

5671591 everybody has to move run and grab as many hilltops as they can to enlarge the settlements because everything we take now will stay ours everything we dont grab will go to them
5671592 it is the duty of israeli leaders to explain to public opinion clearly and courageously a certain number of facts that are forgotten with time the first of these is that there is no zionism colonialization or jewish state without the eviction of the arabs and the expropriation of their lands
5671593 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
5671594 we jews we are the destroyers and will remain the destroyers nothing you can do will meet our demands and needs we will forever destroy because we want a world of our own

5671596 what i want to do is cause trouble for the kuffar with hit and runs everywhere cause fear and panic in their countries make them nervous so they make mistakes
5671597 but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs then well all be back to square one but with inflation still high this spiral has to be nipped in the bud and that means having interest rates at a suitable level until the threat of higher inflation has passed
5671598 some have looked to the mpc to cut its interest rate to help but our job is to fight inflation because thats the best basis for the economy to grow to create jobs and allow living standards to rise

5671602 la gesti n de domingo cavallo como ministro de econom a en sus dos etapas tuvo aciertos y errores yo siento un enorme respeto por l
5671603 desde luego estamos mejorando lo cual es muy alentador en hungr a lo hicimos bien y demostramos que vamos hacia adelante y que lucharemos para acabar cuartos en el campeonato fue importante tambi n lograr un resultado s lido antes del par n del verano es bueno para la din mica del equipo y significa que podemos volver motivados para el resto de temporada
5671604 s por supuesto estoy muy contento de poder conducir en casa por segunda vez siempre se siente algo especial cuando corres delante de tus compatriotas y estoy deseando hacerlo en barcelona est bamos haciendo una buena carrera cuando me tuve que retirar as que espero que esta vez pueda lograr un buen resultado ya que el circuito es nuevo para todos los pilotos
5671605 s ser interesante para m y tambi n para el equipo que ha estado trabajando duro en la preparaci n para esta carrera durante los ltimos meses como es un circuito nuevo creo que da a los pilotos la oportunidad de demostrar lo que pueden hacer pero no soy ingenuo y espero que todos sean lo bastante r pidos debemos hacerlo lo mejor posible y encontrar nuestros puntos de referencia antes que otros para dar una sorpresa
5671606 es cierto que me gustan los circuitos urbanos son siempre un desaf o interesante y la sensaci n de velocidad desde dentro del cockpit es incre ble dar lo m ximo para mejorar el set up con mis ingenieros durante el fin de semana y poder lograr un gran resultado pase lo que pase dar lo mejor de m en este segundo gran premio en espa a
5671607 no lo s pero estoy ciertamente satisfecho de haber sumado puntos en hungr a es importante para el equipo y para m y en general se trata de un fin de semana muy positivo el coche ha funcionado bien yo hice un mont n de vueltas durante la pr ctica libre del viernes y s bado por la ma ana y yo estaba en el ritmo todo el fin de semana y me sent c modo siempre es bueno tener ese tipo de fin de semana y espero seguir as para el resto de la temporada
5671608 esta temporada ya he aprendido varios circuitos nuevos pero la diferencia esta vez es que todos los pilotos est n en las mismas condiciones y tienen que aprenderse el circuito creo que desde el punto de vista del campeonato es interesante visitar los nuevos circuitos es un reto extra para los pilotos as como para los equipos he trabajado duro con el equipo para preparar esta carrera de la mejor manera posible y voy a tratar de conseguir el ritmo r pidamente y maximizar cada vuelta en los entrenamientos
5671609 se trata de un circuito urbano por lo que ser muy complicado pero tambi n muy interesante nunca es f cil aprenderse un nuevo circuito pero como he dicho esta vez todos los equipos y pilotos est n en la misma situaci n ser interesante ver quien puede sentirse c modo m s r pidamente
5671610 me gustar a tener otro s lido fin de semana partiendo de un buen d a de entrenamientos el viernes calificando entre los 10 primeros y mostrando buen de ritmo carrera es de esperar terminar en los puntos as es como voy a abordar esta carrera despu s de las vacaciones de verano estoy descansado y motivado para tener un gran final de temporada
5671611 creo que fue probablemente nuestro mejor resultado de la temporada si bien la posici n final de nelson en alemania fue mejor resultado sobre el papel fuimos los primeros en reconocer que la suerte jug un papel fundamental en ese resultado en hungr a las cosas eran muy diferentes tuvimos dos coches competitivos durante toda la carrera una carrera contra competidores fuertes y corrimos contra ellos en igualdad de condiciones desde el momento en que llegamos all el coche fue competitivo clasificamos bien corrimos bien y tuvimos una buena estrategia los puntos son muy bienvenidos y en las dos ltimas carreras s lo mclaren ha anotado m s puntos que nosotros
5671612 fue otro gran fin de semana para fernando aunque la nica decepci n es que hemos perdido ante raikkonen al final si bien sab amos que raikkonen ten a un coche mucho m s r pido yo realmente pensaba que hab amos hecho lo suficiente para poder permanecer por delante de l en el segundo pit stop al final las cosas no funcionaron y no pudimos conseguir un podio pero a n as fue un gran resultado para fernando y igualando su mejor posici n de principios de la temporada en australia
5671613 todos esper bamos que despu s de hockenheim hubiera recobrado la confianza y este ha sido el caso fue tranquilo confiado luego pas a realizar una carrera perfecta pilotando en hockenheim sin errores significativos fue r pido cuando era preciso conservando los neum ticos cuando era necesario y condujo un fuerte e inteligente carrera
5671614 hay que recordar que hungr a es un circuito muy particular y aunque fernando ha hecho un gran trabajo al mantener a raikkonen detr s de l hasta el ltimo pit stop esto no era indicativo del ritmo de los dos coches de hecho tan pronto como raikkonen se separ de nosotros l fue capaz de hacer las vueltas mucho m s r pido pero dicho todo esto el resto del fin de semana mostr el ritmo de mejora del r28 y las mejoras que hemos venido haciendo paso a paso en las ltimas carreras por lo tanto el rendimiento en hungr a refuerza la creencia de que nos estamos moviendo en la direcci n correcta y me da confianza en que podemos terminar cuarto en el campeonato y terminar la temporada con el tercer coche m s r pido
5671615 hemos visto que bmw tuvo un pobre fin de semana y toyota tuvo un buen fin de semana pero no creo que la jerarqu a cambie de repente en este momento nosotros tenemos una tendencia al alza mientras que bmw tiene un poco de tendencia a la baja y en toyota parecen fluctuar as que no creo que la carrera en s muestra un cambio en el statu quo sino que simplemente refuerza las tendencias que se han venido desarrollando desde hace un tiempo
5671616 esperamos con inter s todas las carreras y creo que nos gusta el desaf o de un nuevo circuito disfrutamos el ambiente de visitar nuevos lugares y el equipo de carrera ha tenido un breve descanso para desconectar sin duda parece un lugar fabuloso
5671617 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
5671618 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim

5671669 the us government is strongly opposed to restrictive trade practices or boycotts targeted at israel
5671670 the commerce department is closely monitoring efforts that appear to be made to reinvigorate the arab boycott of israel and will use all of its resources to vigorously enforce us anti boycott regulations
5671671 yes of course the boycott is still in place and is still enforced

5671682 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
5671683 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5671684 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5671685 the document signed by mikhail saakashvili completely omits the opening sentence the introductory part it is an integral part of the document and when the leaders of south ossetia abkhazia and now russia have signed the document they signed an agreed version not some shortened or edited one

5671872 kids are going to drink whether its legal or illegal
5671873 wed at least be able to have a more open dialogue with students about drinking as opposed to this sham where people dont want to talk about it because its a violation of the law
5671874 how many times must we relearn the lessons of prohibition
5671875 adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting signing contracts serving on juries and enlisting in the military but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer

5671880 if they drink too much in the beginning of an evening they can get alcohol poisoning
5671881 theyre really not aware of how their judgment is impaired we hope they dont get into a car or if theyre a young woman go to a fraternity party its just not healthy
5671882 a lot of young people feel that they are afraid of enforcement
5671883 they tend to get in a car and go someplace else and thats very very dangerous i worry about it every weekend

5671885 its almost like contraband once you get it you have to drink all of it

5671887 i think we should maybe take a lesson from what other countries are doing
5671888 lets debate the age and look at the pros and cons
5671889 i really think weve got to somehow be able to control it better because what we have done now is driven it underground and we cant do anything about it
5671890 there are a lot of things we could do if it wasnt underground
5671891 were taking the convention and sort of blowing away the smoke filled back room insider version of the convention and opening it up to america
5671892 and were doing it with technology by moving the convention outside of the convention hall and were doing it with a huge recruitment drive for the democratic party
5671893 this years democratic convention is more inclusive and accessible than past conventions in large part because of the complete live hd streaming video coverage that will be made available on our web site
5671894 more people than ever before will be part of the convention experience watching live or whenever is most convenient all you need is a computer and an internet connection

5671905 we believe it would be unrealistic to return to pre industrial levels of nutrient input to oceans but an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century
5671906 whether or not these observed changes in oxygen can be attributed to global warming alone is still unresolved
5671907 we calculated about 135 times hed been interrogated and about the first 120 the only interest they had was al jazeera
5671908 they told him that they thought al jazeera was an al qaeda front
5671909 they were trying to get him to finger a number of well known al jazeera journalists as being in the muslim brotherhood
5671910 they wanted me to betray the principles of my job and to turn me into a spy
5671911 if we were going to try to silence al jazeera it would be at a higher level of personnel than some cameraman trainee
5671912 was trained by al jazeera in the use of cameras
5671913 we will never say kufuor has done nothing but when we come into power we are going to continue with the good works of the npp has started

5671923 the decision was planned hard and long if he had come up too boldly he would have been destroyed that is why it was kept close to a few people
5671924 naturally my open participation in partisan politics was curtailed even though i may not be known on the political platform i have been very active in the economic platform i am proud to have contributed to the economic achievements of president kufuor in the last seven years
5671925 i have made my modest contribution behind the scenes to the solid economic foundation of the first eight years of the npp government as a result of the strong foundation laid by the npp our economy is ready for a big leap and in the wisdom of our flagbearer and national executive committee members the time is ripe to bring me to the fore front this is a view to which i subscribe

5671929 while the demand for petroleum products keeps growing and has largely remained as inelastic as ever the proliferation of omcs to more than 40 on our market has now given the average consumer a choice
5671930 what has been the sellers market for so many years is slowly becoming a buyers market
5671931 as a truly national marketer for petroleum products goil has always maintained that in the heat of the sky rocketing cost of crude oil on the global market it will stand firmly by continually exploring ways of cushioning off some of the shocks and hardships

5672057 in often lengthy remarks about georgia this week on the campaign trail mccain repeatedly talked of how many times he had been to the region and let it be known that he had talked daily with saakashvili since the crisis began in an interview this week on cnn saakashvili said he was
5672058 and i really appreciate that because senator mccain has been fighting for the freedom of georgia for many many years
5672059 a top foreign policy adviser scil of maccain randy scheunemann was until recently a paid lobbyist for georgias government
5672060 mccain announced this week that two of his closest allies sens lindsey o graham r s c and joseph i lieberman i conn would travel to georgias capital of tbilisi on his behalf after a similar journey by secretary of state condoleezza rice
5672061 the white house has started to panic over a july 9 meeting between condi rice and mikheil saakashvili desperate to suggest they didnt encourage georgias crack down in south ossetia
5672062 some voters may worry does he want to start a new cold war the risk for mccain is that he could overplay the issue and frighten war weary voters whose priorities right now lie closer to home
5672063 he may not want to be vice president again since hes already done that for eight years but certainly hes somebody that ill be getting advice from as we go forward and hopefully hell help me when im president

5672090 the russians dont look kindly on the military cooperation of israeli firms with the georgian army and as far as i know israelis doing security consulting left georgia in the past few days because of the events there
5672091 georgia is located in a strategic place between turkey russia and iran
5672092 in the past four years it has developed economically particularly in the real estate tourism and service sectors the russians for geopolitical and strategic reasons will not permit georgia to become a forward nato base on their border and will not permit it to develop a burgeoning economy

5672137 today parliament has become sovereign we can hold our head up high in the world and say that we too are a democracy
5672138 this is the first time in pakistans political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions
5672139 i dont want anything from anybody i have no interest i leave my future in the hands of the nation and people

5672142 it is important to highlight president musharrafs commitment to tackle terrorism to promote dialogue with india especially over kashmir and to root out corruption
5672143 but reform depends above all on legitimacy and that is why the uk has been at pains to stress the importance for pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals and why we believe a strong democracy is key

5672157 it is the view of this department that the environmental impact statement submitted was deficient and the information provided was inadequate in a number of respects

5672163 the footpath is well used by dog walkers and i would therefore ask anyone who saw someone matching this description or any suspicious activity to contact police

5672166 we need to make trade logistics and border infrastructure a priority in the short term or lose opportunities to other global competitors who are better organized to facilitate trade
5672167 on oil alone canada has been the largest supplier to the u s since 1999 not saudi arabia not kuwait nor any other producer from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries
5672168 canada is a stable supplier of energy to the u s whether it is gas and oil in the west or integrated electricity grids in the east
5672169 and being close means lower delivery costs than most other power suppliers
5672170 if theyre infected with west nile where they have west nile fever or they have west nile virus meningitis or encephalitis these data can tell them what to expect that gradually over about a year their mental and physical function generally and on average will return to normal
5672171 i think at least it helps patients and physicians and their families to know what to expect over time
5672172 i had to learn how to start all over again walking you name it
5672173 initially most people felt that it was a relatively mild infection and that people recover from it very quickly
5672174 i think this paper as well as a couple of papers out of the u s in the last couple of years have really hit home the fact that this disease has a tremendous impact on people
5672175 and a year to recovery is a long time and even people with what we thought was the more mild form of the disease are significantly debilitated for a period of time
5672176 whats interesting and what surprised us was the fact that there seems to be a lot of resiliency in individuals who had the encephalitis or meningitis or the milder symptoms
5672177 this is a very exciting time for the new rapidfix website
5672178 they did ask us to remix wonderwall when that first came out but basically we didnt know how to do it
5672179 yeah that would have been good to do it was a fairly big song
5672180 when noels name comes through on your phone the command has been issued it was exciting to do it and im glad they like it
5672181 we chucked loads of bits out and did it how we would want it to sound

5672186 even though i was under pressure i managed to keep it together
5672187 i take the blame for everything that happened but now i just want to focus on the future and 2012 the london olympics i have had little bits of help from here and there to prepare for this and i am very grateful for that

5672193 so far in his interrogation he has confessed to his involvement in the ahmedabad blasts
5672194 though bashir is cooperating in interrogation he is not revealing much details he is just giving short replies to the questions asked by the officials most of his replies are in yes and no
5672195 i would expect that you would see that in the next 12 months
5672196 our events are already starting to meet that criteria we have some pretty exciting financial models and i think over the next 12 months you will see us become profitable
5672197 on a world basis there is plenty of natural gas available for an extended period of time
5672198 you run the wind when you can just like we run the hydro when we can because the incremental cost is very low
5672199 but then you have to be concerned about the reliability of the system and that youre protected and that you can meet loads when you lose your lower cost and volatile resource

5672204 estamos en el sitio donde nos corresponde por peso poblacional en el ranking de endeudamiento donde el municipio m s endeudado con cifras estratosf ricas es el de madrid seguido de barcelona y otros
5672205 que nosotros no estamos necesitando y estamos trabajando para no llegar a esa situaci n ni a ese plan de viabilidad en la que est n todos los ayuntamientos de mayor poblaci n que nosotros y muchos ayuntamientos de menor poblaci n
5672206 hay algunas empresas que son muy deficitarias esto es aquellas empresas que prestan un servicio a muchos ciudadanos sin percibir nada a cambio como tussam
5672207 tenemos dificultades econ micas porque hacemos m s cosas de los recursos que tenemos para hacerlas pero continuaremos en la l nea de evitar el plan de saneamiento que la mayor parte de municipios no han podido evitar
5672208 y ah reiteremos nuestra voluntad de no repercutir en los usuarios el incremento del coste del combustible estamos trabajando en esa l nea
5672209 que es muy alto pues damos muchos servicios que requieren mucha mano de obra como la polic a local limpieza autobuses parques y jardines eso nos tiene condicionada una parte muy sustanciosa del presupuesto

5672243 the desire to bash people and be bashed is burning stronger than ever it wasnt a big decision this club has an exciting future
5672244 there were a couple of other offers on the table but none that were right for me

5672253 id seen maybe one or two staph infections in all my time in football but three years ago we put down a new synthetic turf on our football field and we began to have three to four cases a week
5672254 players didnt want to touch each other it wasnt until our trainer todd smith said he was going to try to disinfect the field that we got it under control
5672255 you know one day you cut yourself and you think its a cut i washed my hands i shaved i wasnt rubbing dirt in it but the next day its a raging infection
5672256 just like that its doctors and antibiotics and it had just been a little cut earl weaver four or five years ago went in for a normal arthroscopic knee surgery and ended up spending three months recovering from a staph infection

5672261 these are troubling statistics that warrant more aggressive education prevention and testing initiatives
5672262 at each of our testing sites we are seeing an increasing number of young gay men particularly african american men coming to us newly infected
5672263 these are young men who dont remember the first wave of the hiv aids epidemic and came of age when effective treatments were available as a result they have never seen hiv as a major problem
5672264 one surprising theme emerged even though everyone recognized hiv was a serious issue every group identified hiv as really being a problem for another demographic group
5672265 this is of great concern because the highest risk groups do not identify themselves as being high risk and thus increase their susceptibility to hiv through unsafe behavior and a lack of knowledge

5672313 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5672314 that is to possess the concept of five you need a word for five
5672315 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognising and representing numerosities and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks
5672316 for example children were asked to put out counters that matched the number of sounds made by banging two sticks together
5672317 they had to use an abstract representation of for example the fiveness of the bangs and the fiveness of the counters
5672318 we found that warlpiri and anindilyakwa children performed as well as or better than the english speaking children on a range of tasks and on numerosities up to nine even though they lacked number words
5672319 the food and drink festival is a good opportunity for food lovers to try something new more and more people are asking for fish and we are cooking this dish which is also called desi baag just like we make it at home

5672321 the role of the ip pbx is also starting to change we expect that by 2010 many users routinely will be using an integrated set of collaboration tools beyond telephony switching among them to reach the highest value combination of communications services inside and outside the firewall with colleagues as well as with partners suppliers and customers across wired and wireless networks
5672322 it is increasingly important that companies consider their telephony partners in the broader context of a uc strategy companies should take this opportunity to consolidate their investments into a smaller number of vendors using ip telephony to deliver a consistent platform across the estate of users in preparation for integration with uc and collaboration platforms especially for branch small offices and customer service locations

5672355 90210 redux are going to have to wait a bit longer
5672356 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere
5672357 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5672358 by refusing to send screeners of the 90210 premiere to critics the cw has aroused deep suspicions
5672359 90210 is already generating a zip codes worth of interest thanks in part to the speculation without any reviews the network and studio probably feel as if reviews would only hurt that stream of press and publicity

5672447 mr yang informed his mother that the new lodger was a student and that he came from the jinzhou area of the northern seaport city dalian
5672448 we have no further information to identify the lodger and enquiries to trace him have so far failed
5672449 we urgently need to identify this unknown lodger who could have vital information to assist the murder investigation and to eliminate him from our enquiries
5672450 enquiries are continuing into allegations of internet betting scams and the obtaining of fraudulent university qualifications however our enquiries thus far do not reveal the couples involvement in major criminality and their lifestyle and finances are not what could be expected of anyone involved in organised crime
5672451 the levels of violence used in the killings is completely disproportionate to the level of minor fraudulent activity discovered on the couples computer thus far
5672452 we must not lose sight of the fact that xi zhou and zhen xing yang are victims of a senseless killing and their parents and friends are left devastated and unable to comprehend what has happened

5672468 i cant accept collective responsibility for the decision to commit britain now to military action in iraq without international agreement or domestic support

5672487 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5672488 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
5672489 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
5672490 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
5672491 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
5672492 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e

5672498 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
5672499 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades

5672840 is that the drive be a park thatll solve the drag racing but not of course immediately
5672841 it was really only a matter of time before this would happen
5672842 connecticut should explore adopting a measure similar to that of california that gives law enforcement the right to confiscate and crush cars that are involved in drag racing
5672843 racers should be required to attend the crushing to press upon them the seriousness of their recklessness
5672844 look if the city would heed enforce the general recommendations of his groups the speed limit and all the regulations that would make the difference its established that the racers come many of them from out of town if new haven were known as a place where regulations are enforced where theres more concern for enforcement than exists now it would no longer be a destination for this kind of activity

5672854 china is witnessing the start of a golden age of wind power development and the magnitude of growth has caught even policymakers off guard
5672855 it is widely believed that wind power will be able to compete with coal generation by as early as 2015 that will be the turning point in china which by then will be the worlds largest energy consumer
5672856 chinas wind energy market is unrecognisable from two years ago it is huge huge huge but it is not realised yet in the outside world
5672857 a few years ago wind energy was boutique something to show off to foreigners to prove how green they are but now it is a very serious part of their energy policy
5672858 they can make things happen so quickly in china compared to the west when they make up their minds it is incredible how fast things happen
5672859 ive been here since the beginning the turbines are like my children it took 10 years to reach 64 000 kilowatt hours because that period was the research phase but now the government is committed to wind energy so we can grow quickly
5672860 everyone is opting for big turbines it is more economic to have one 1 500 kilowatt turbine than two 750 kilowatt turbines and the maintenance costs are lower
5672861 there is still a gap between chinese companies and western companies in terms of research and development because we started later
5672862 most of our technology comes from germany but in the first half of this year we bought the company that taught us how to do things that has solved the problem of research and development now we want to start selling overseas
5672863 in this context it is reasonable to expect chinese wind turbines to find receptive export markets in the near term despite the financing and insurance related challenges stemming from a limited track record for many products
5672864 it is probably going to be the most competitive turbine market in the world very quickly
5672865 elsewhere it is a sellers market now in china we are on the tipping point of it becoming a buyers market
5672866 in 2008 it is likely to grow 1 5 times so growth is actually decelerating but in terms of volume size and scale this has become a respectable market globally
5672867 our task is tough and our time is limited party organisations and governments at all levels must give priority to emission reduction and bring the idea deep into peoples hearts
5672868 the market is ripe for china not replicating what europe and us did in the past but doing it better

5672893 while living in holloway london in 1852 i left a tract at the residence of the rev
5672894 as i entered mr mckenzie said young woman did you leave a tract with the nefarious doctrine of joe smith
5672895 i said no sir i left a tract containing the principles of life and salvation as revealed by the lord and his son jesus christ to joseph smith the prophet
5672896 he answered in a most contemptible manner joe smith the horse thief the money digger
5672897 i said did you ever know him i am glad to find someone who really knew him
5672898 then i said how do you know he was a money digger or horse thief
5672899 why he said everyone knows it the papers all say so
5672900 i replied well sir if i presented myself in court as a witness in the delarue murder case that was then on trial and if the judge asked me what i knew about the case and i answered
5672901 no sir but everybody knows it all the papers all say so
5672902 the rev charles mcguire said her point is well taken brother robert
5672903 mckenzie then asked well what are the principles you speak of
5672904 young woman it is false doctrine baptism is not essential to salvation for the thief on the cross with our lord went straight to heaven with jesus
5672905 i said i beg pardon sir but according to the creed the thief went straight to hell
5672906 they were honest enough to say they had never seen that or been cognizant of this statement in their creed until then
5672907 i told them they were some of those whom isaiah spoke of when he said darkness would cover the whole earth and gross darkness the minds of the people
5672908 i was there in discussion with them three hours and when i left the rev charles mcguire walked to the door with me he said you are very young in years to know the lord as you do i would give all i possess if i knew the lord as you do with the assurance you have
5672909 i answered well sir the lord is no respecter of persons you can obtain the same light and knowledge and have more power with god
5672910 i said by giving up your so called holy orders humbling yourself as a little child and entering into covenant with the lord by being baptized by one commissioned of jesus christ for the remission of your sins then having the hands of the elders laid upon your head that you may receive the holy ghost
5672911 he bowed his head and said may the lord bless you
5672912 i never saw him after i had many very interesting discussions with ministers of different denominations
5672913 it is fifty nine years since i was baptized the gospel is true and just as dear to me and if possible more dear the lord has preserved me through all the troubles and trials i have been called to pass through and he will preserve and bless all who live worthy pay their tithes and offerings and who will cultivate the faith that was once delivered to the saints

5672920 and stay in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance
5672921 there are three do not ask me about them a man who leaves the jamaaah disobeys his leader and dies disobedient a female or male slave who runs away then dies and a woman whose husband is absent and left her with everything she needs and after he left she made a wanton display of herself do not ask about them

5672927 o female slave of al jabbaar are you going to the mosque
5672928 go back and wash yourself for i heard the messenger of allaah
5672929 the prophet peace and blessings of allaah be upon him expelled so and so and umar expelled so and so
5672930 the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him cursed men who imitate women and women who imitate men
5672931 the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him said there are three who will not enter paradise and allaah will not even look at them on the day of resurrection one who disobeys his parents a woman who imitates men and the duyooth cuckold weak man who feels no jealousy over his womenfolk
5672932 it was said to aaishah may allaah be pleased with her what if a woman wears mens sandals she said the messenger of allaah
5672933 i heard ahmad being asked about a man who dresses his slave woman in a tunic he said do not clothe her in mens garments do not make her look like a man
5672934 i said to ahmad can he give her bachelor sandals to wear he said no unless she wears them to do wudoo i said what about for beauty he said no i said can he cut her hair short he said no
5672935 verily allaah will not change the condition of a people as long as they do not change their state themselves

5672946 the legal cases between oklahoma and arkansas evolved from a conflict over point source pollution involving municipal wastewater discharge to a conflict over nonpoint source pollution in the form of nutrient runoff from poultry litter
5672947 in light of three decades or more of significant structural changes in the animal agricultural production system this shift from point source to nonpoint source mirrors the evolution of how water quality has been addressed since the enactment of clean water act
5672948 discernable confined and discrete conveyances including any pipe ditch channel tunnel conduit well from which pollutants may be discharged
5672949 a consequence of these structural changes is that extraordinary amounts of animal waste are produced in geographically limited areas
5672950 this waste must be disposed of or utilized somehow and a traditional and common method is for producers to apply it to the land as fertilizer
5672951 policymakers may begin to consider new policy approaches to addressing nonpoint source pollution particularly if they conclude that addressing the issue through region based litigation may not be the most effective tool to address a national issue the thought might be that perhaps theres a better way to address these problems without litigation or overly burdensome government regulation

5672958 we dont want to spoil the party as were expecting a lot of supporters we havent played at home since last autumn and the fans will come to the stadium with new hope were aiming to win this game but we know that there are no weak teams in europe
5672959 strict discipline and maximum commitment on the pitch are the crucial components we need to succeed against andorra
5672960 we expect a very tense battle both teams are not considered favourites in the group so each believe they have a real chance to get some points
5672961 were going into this game with a lot of hope and were looking forward to getting the ball rolling

5673027 die injektionslipolyse wird vorwiegend an stellen angewandt wo trotz gesunder ern hrung und sport kleinere lokale fettansammlungen einfach nicht in den griff zu bekommen sind vor allem am bauch an den h ften am becken reiterhosen aber auch an den oberarmen und im gesicht bei doppelkinn und h ngeb ckchen wir die injektionslipolyse mit gro em erfolg eingesetzt

5673030 cine sunt suporterii stelei sa injure pe cine vor ei mi am pus deja o gheata in cui iar daca mai continui sa joc asa o pun si pe a doua
5673031 m am simtit un pic stupid si jenat ca nu vazusem niciun episod inainte de intalnirea cu ei dar ma bucur sa spun ca episoadele pe care mi le au trimis sa le vad au fost foarte foarte captivante si foarte bune un pic sumbre si triste ca mai toate aparitiile in care am fost implicat asa ca sunt foarte incantat
5673032 in fact i am rather looking forward to it im sure that the atmosphere will be great spaniards after all are known to be hot blooded im certain that things will be at a peak on saturday
5673033 i actually do already know the circuit but will only go at it at racing speed for the first time on friday at the training session it is rather atypical for a town circuit since it is very speedy unlike monte carlo where one sticks to the guard railings so to say but that is fine for me since im known to love speed
5673034 the closer we get to the finale the more on edge those drivers will be that have not had some success this year
5673035 infineon raceway is one of the most technical tracks we run on all year
5673036 it has big hills big turns and high speed so it makes running well there very difficult
5673037 fortunately weve been quick in sonoma on each visit but we havent been able to bring home a win weve finished in the top five for the past two years and i really want to take it to the next level this season in order to keep the championship battle going were not out of it but were going to need a strong run to be able to stay in the fight
5673038 not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god
5673039 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart
5673040 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god

5673055 aerodynamics is extremely important for an electric vehicle like the volt which is designed to drive up to 40 miles using only electricity to power the car
5673056 by minimizing aero drag we can maximize the range of the battery so it shouldnt come as any surprise that my exterior design team spent countless hours in the wind tunnel with our aerodynamicist to refine the volts exterior we believe this was time well spent when youre trying to extend gas free driving of the vehicle youll take all the efficiency you can get

5673071 the thoughts and prayers of task force kandahar are with the family and friends of our interpreter who was killed in this incident
5673072 we also hope for a speedy and full recovery for both the injured child and our wounded soldier
5673073 task force kandahar condemns this attack that was carried out near a busy marketplace and in the presence of innocent civilian bystanders
5673074 contrary to the talibans recent claim to act in the best interest of afghans this reprehensible act clearly demonstrates the insurgents contempt for the people of afghanistan they continue to strike out at any target even in areas were afghan women and children are present and they do so without thought or remorse
5673075 the afghans do not support this so called insurgency they are its primary targets
5673076 i know were not supposed to be selling it and we know our supplier gets it from pirates but we only by from him so were cool
5673077 we said georgia would eventually become a member of nato alongside ukraine and thats certainly the position that we will be advocating today
5673078 we need to open the door to get the military monitors in now
5673079 the dissolution of syria and iraq into ethnically or religiously unique areas such as in lebanon is israels primary target on the eastern front
5673080 an iraqi iranian war will tear iraq apart and cause its downfall at home even before it is able to organize a struggle on a wide front against us every kind of inter arab confrontation will assist us in the short run and will shorten the way to the more important aim of breaking up iraq into denominations as in syria and lebanon
5673081 in iraq a division into provinces along ethnic religious lines as in syria during ottoman times is possible so three or more states will exist around the three major cities basra baghdad and mosul and shiite areas in the south will separate from the sunni and kurdish north
5673082 a clean break a new strategy for securing the realm
5673083 work closely with turkey and jordan to contain destabilize and roll back some of its most dangerous threats
5673084 change the nature of its relations with the palestinians including upholding the right of hot pursuit for self defense into all palestinian areas
5673085 forge a new basis for relations with the united states stressing self reliance maturity strategic cooperation on areas of mutual concern and furthering values inherent to the west
5673086 the strategic initiative along its northern borders by engaging hizballah syria and iran as the principal agents of aggression in lebanon
5673087 israel can shape its strategic environment in cooperation with turkey and jordan by weakening containing and even rolling back syria
5673088 rebuilding americas defenses strategy forces and resources for a new century
5673089 over the long term iran may well prove as large a threat to us interests in the gulf as iraq has
5673090 the united states has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in gulf regional security
5673091 the need for a substantial american force presence in the gulf transcends the issue of the regime change of saddam hussein
5673092 may be to correct the historical defect and move in stages toward a three state solution kurds in the north sunnis in the center and shiites in the south
5673093 citing the example of the break up of yugoslavia gelb stated that the americans and europeans
5673094 the first step would be to make the north and south into self governing regions with boundaries drawn as closely as possible along ethnic lines
5673095 at the same time draw down american troops in the sunni triangle and ask the united nations to oversee the transition to self government there
5673096 several islamic fundamentalist organisations including osama bin ladens al qaeda
5673097 mujahideen mercenaries from the middle east and central asia were recruited to fight in the ranks of the kosovo liberation army kla in 1998 99 largely supporting natos war effort
5673098 the u s state department listed the kla as a terrorist organization indicating that it was financing its operations with money from the international heroin trade and loans from islamic countries and individuals among them allegedly usama bin laden
5673099 the brother of a leader in an egyptian jihad organization and also a military commander of usama bin laden was leading an elite kla unit during the kosovo conflict
5673100 is an exact replica of an extreme right wing israeli plan to balkanize iraq an essential part of the balkanization of the whole middle east curiously henry kissinger was selling the same idea even before the 2003 invasion of iraq
5673101 this is classic divide and rule the objective is the perpetuation of arab disunity
5673102 independent commission set up by congress with the approval of president george w bush
5673103 has grown increasingly interested in the idea of splitting the shiite sunni and kurdish regions of iraq as the only alternative to what baker calls cutting and running or staying the course
5673104 iraqs federal future is already enshrined within its constitution allowing regions to form if not actually prescribing how this should happen
5673105 the iraqi parliament dominated by shia and kurds passed a bill earlier this month october 2006 allowing federal regions to form by majority vote in the provinces seeking merger
5673106 the law which unsurprisingly failed to win sunni support will be reviewed over the next 18 months in a bid to bring its opponents round
5673107 a system based upon five regions would seem to have more chance of succeeding
5673108 accepting that international statecraft has never developed effective tools short of war for readjusting faulty borders a mental effort to grasp the middle easts
5673109 iraq should have been divided into three smaller states immediately
5673110 saudi arabia would suffer as great a dismantling as pakistan
5673111 iran a state with madcap boundaries would lose a great deal of territory to unified azerbaijan free kurdistan the arab shia state and free baluchistan but would gain the provinces around herat in todays afghanistan
5673112 what afghanistan would lose to persia in the west it would gain in the east as pakistans northwest frontier tribes would be reunited with their afghan brethren
5673113 for now but given time and the inevitable attendant bloodshed new and natural borders will emerge babylon has fallen more than once
5673114 oh and one other dirty little secret from 5 000 years of history ethnic cleansing works
5673115 has been used in a training program at natos defense college for senior military officers this map as well as other similar maps has most probably been used at the national war academy as well as in military planning circles
5673116 the sweeping reconfiguration of borders he proposes would necessarily involve massive ethnic cleansing and accompanying bloodshed on perhaps a genocidal scale
5673117 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs while leaving the central government in charge of common interests
5673118 the first is to establish three largely autonomous regions with a viable central government in baghdad the kurdish sunni and shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws administration and internal security the central government would control border defense foreign affairs and oil revenues
5673119 the second element would be to entice the sunnis into joining the federal system with an offer they couldnt refuse to begin with running their own region should be far preferable to the alternatives being dominated by kurds and shiites in a central government or being the main victims of a civil war
5673120 would look like this the central government would be based on the areas where there are genuine common interests among the different iraqi parties that is foreign affairs border defense currency and above all oil and gas production and revenues
5673121 as for the regions whether they be three or four or five whatever it may be its up to all this is up to the iraqis to decide would be responsible for legislation administration and internal security
5673122 something that the united states was going to force down their throats
5673123 when ambassador ryan crocker appeared before the senate foreign relations committee he testified in favor of federalism in his private conversations with senators he also supported the idea
5673124 break up of iraq into three separate states with their own governments and representatives to the united nations but continued economic cooperation in a larger entity modeled on the european union
5673125 that the united states shouldnt necessarily keep iraq from splitting up
5673126 we officially passed final cert on our first try friday august 15th
5673127 fellow countrymen with deep sorrow and grief i would like to inform the people of zambia that our president dr levy patrick mwanawasa died this morning at 1030 hours 0830 gmt

5673189 relative to the 13 features examined in the study interest in alternative powertrain technologies particularly clean diesel is much higher among consumers in germany and the united kingdom compared with consumers in the united states
5673190 the gap in interest may be attributed to the tendency of consumers in european markets to purchase smaller vehicles that are more conducive to hybrid electric technology diesel technology also has a much stronger presence in these regions compared with the united states
5673191 low interest levels for satellite radio may be attributed to low market penetration for this feature in both germany and the united kingdom
5673192 however as new satellite radio providers enter the market it is likely that an increase in familiarity will also lead to a general increase in consumer interest for this feature

5673225 while she understands jamie likes to spend time with kate she worried that his focus on the band is slipping
5673226 shes particularly upset at present because shes frequently unable to track him down by phone or email at all
5673227 jamie didnt think it would be a permanent split he just had to wait for kate to calm down after their row
5673228 he loves that kate is tempestuous but he doesnt want to be a doormat and give in to her on everything shes starting to realise that too so is trying to be less demanding
5673229 of course it will be a pop album what else could we do you do get some bands where their egos take over and they come back with a rockier sound but we know what we are good at and we are sticking to it
5673230 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous lover brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a c p about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more

5673331 heute war ein vorlaufsieg angesagt aber wenn der abstand so gro ist ist das deprimierend und entt uschend es l uft nicht so wie ich es mir vorgestellt habe
5673332 mit der steigenden zahl von cpu kernen in einem chip nimmt auch der bedarf an cache speicher sprunghaft zu
5673333 ich w rde sogar weiter gehen und sagen das schlimmste kommt noch
5673334 es wird eine gro e sein eine der investmentbanken oder gro banken

5673336 wir haben die anzahl der themen ein wenig verringert um so mehr raum f r hintergr ndige berichterstattung und zur vertiefung zu gewinnen
5673337 wenn die nachrichtenlage schwierig ist so wie jetzt im kaukasuskrieg suchen die zuschauer uns weil unser korrespondentennetz exzellent aufgestellt ist dieses vertrauen erarbeiten wir uns durch tagt glich sorgf ltigen verl sslichen und glaubw rdigen journalismus
5673338 wir freuen uns ber die tolle gesamtnote von 1 89
5673339 auch in den bereichen bedienungsfreundlichkeit der website kundenservice sowie datenschutz und sicherheit haben wir als beste abgeschnitten
5673340 stolz sind wir dass wir bereits f nf monate nach der er ffnung unseres berliner b ros einen solchen erfolg feiern k nnen
5673341 wir m chten zuk nftig gerne noch bessere angebote und noch k rzere lieferzeiten anbieten k nnen
5673342 nicht jeder kann oder m chte das gesamte berufsleben im fitnessbereich arbeiten
5673343 eine zukunftssichere ausbildung sollte daher sowohl den fachspezifischen bereich abdecken als auch die option er ffnen in berufsfeldern au erhalb der fitnessbranche zu arbeiten
5673344 durch die vielf ltigen kombinationsm glichkeiten findet jeder teilnehmer die zu seiner schulischen und beruflichen vorqualifikation und pers nlichen interessenslage passende ausbildung

5673346 die entsch digungssumme die das gericht verh ngt hat ist bezeichnend und soll f r andere nutzer abschreckend wirken
5673347 das urteil zeigt dass direkte ma nahmen gegen rechtsverletzer eine wichtige und effektive waffe im kampf gegen online piraterie sind
5673348 gegen sie alle k nnten nun gerichtliche schritte eingeleitet werden
5673349 filesharing ist ein massenph nomen bei der menge an tauschb rsennutzern w rde eine verfolgung des einzelnen das problem einer unmenge an strafverfahren mit sich bringen

5673352 in der vergangenheit wurden zwar die zulieferer geknebelt aber der gesamtprozess nicht optimiert jetzt k nnen die etablierten hersteller von den billigproduzenten lernen dass sie nicht mehr alles neu machen m ssen stattdessen k nnen sie standards bernehmen und dort ressourcen einsparen wo ohnehin ein zulieferer die entwicklung macht
5673353 ill swap you a vioxx recall for a mad cow advisory
5673354 how about two tomato scares and a lead paint in childrens toys warning

5673361 i will be travelling with the 13 players to kigali and will help in their training alongside their teachers before they lunked up with their colleagues for a residential training camp in nairobi
5673362 first of all let me state in clear unambiguous terms that neither me as an individual nor the gfa as an organisation has anything against a local becoming a national coach
5673363 the sole criteria is competence and under the umbrella of competence we have others like personality traits compensation package experience and others if any ghanaian satisfied us none of would have hesitated at all in giving him the job
5673364 on our last visit here we came here as celtel we are now back bigger and better as zain
5673365 die finanzmarktexperten haben sich von der negativen zuwachsrate im zweiten quartal zu recht nicht sonderlich beeindrucken lassen
5673366 wir vermeiden dadurch auch einen dauerwahlkampf und gleichzeitig politik stillstand vom fr hjahr bis zum herbst den sich deutschland nicht leisten kann
5673367 eine gesetzliche neuregelung der bestimmungen muss nach der sommerpause angegangen werden mit dem ziel die kommende bundestagswahl mit klaren verfassungskonformen bestimmungen zu erm glichen
5673368 not every girl or woman has a chance to come into this magazine not every woman has a chance at an olympic medal either
5673369 my first focus is now the olympics and what happens now
5673370 hes my partner so i have to see the first one
5673371 we have good trainers a good system i think its a combination of all those things
5673372 canadian kayaker adam van koeverden set a world best time in the 500 meter k 1 in his qualifying heat he won in 1 35 554 and advanced to thursdays semifinal
5673373 ive been here 10 days and i have seen people winning medals so i have just been wanting to get on with it
5673374 im happy to hear that i have broke it but i can definitely go faster than that
5673375 defending olympic gold medalists katalin kovacs and natasa janic won their heat in the 500 meter k 2 in 1 42 162 and will be the biggest challenge to reinhardt and fischer americans rami zur and carrie johnson both moved on to the semifinals
5673376 i just wanted to save a little bit for the semifinal
5673377 i havent trained for three days and my morale is down
5673378 we need a solid programme for there players in the provinces and the starting point could be the money which has been given to various constituencies for soccer
5673379 coaches in schools have done their best to nurture the skills of players and we believe it is only fair if they are supported for further education through scholarships
5673380 we need not struggle because this is a solid start the only way forward is to open up centres in the provinces
5673381 we decided to leave him alone and minimise the distractions ahead of tonights match
5673382 he will prepare for the match for now and we will deal with the politics later
5673383 he actually needs the team more than we need him
5673384 initially we also thought that he wouldnt show up but he also knows that he is thought to be a bit overweight and unfit so this may be an opportunity for him to prove his detractors wrong and earn a move away from blackburn in the process
5673385 we are a big country when it comes to winning medals in top races at the global level so i believe we can replicate the same success in organising this athletics event
5673386 the olympic events are increasing in number and they want to restrict the number of athletes
5673387 we have thought a bit about the wounded beast at home
5673388 but this is an opportunity for us and we have to make the most of it
5673389 the springboks would not want to suffer at home again and we are playing at one of their favourite destinations
5673390 it would be hard for the boks to win the series but hence their likely response to this game they are world champions and there is no way they would want to contemplate another loss
5673391 while the score appears to be one sided the contest was everything but that
5673392 the first half was the biggest indicator of that there was an awful lot of rugby played but very little to show for it from the scoreboard at half time
5673393 new zealand played well and absorbed the pressure from the springboks and they took the points that were on offer
5673394 it was so bright the bright flash but i heard a little electric i heard the zzzz first you know you can hear the electricity i mean you can hear it go zzzzzz and then you get all warm
5673395 he will need some support for a long long time hes paid a pretty heavy price for this service to our country the least we can do is show him support were inviting everybody to come to this groundbreaking event
5673396 when i saw them come in i was like wow john mccain is at olive garden
5673397 i am happy just to be alive after the injury i was complaining of asthma after surgery last year but it was not that i missed an injection and blood went into my lungs football was not the most important thing i nearly lost my life
5673398 sometimes when things happen you can be knocked off if you are not strong mentally but i am strong mentally and i never give up which is why i am still going strong
5673399 i have been so worried that i can hardly watch football i wish so often that i am on the field but i dont brood over some things i know when the time is right i will enjoy my football again there are ups and downs the most important thing is not to give up because i have given it my all to be able to come back
5673400 stephen can play again but when i will return will remain a surprise i dont want to rush the comeback i want everything to be gradual i have been out for one year and i understand it will take time to get my rhythm back
5673401 i have been in italy training for about a month now

5673417 s pero en esta ocasi n no me ca contra la pared o el suelo porque cuando me d cuenta que se me iba la cabeza estaba cerca de la cama y me dej caer en ella luego los m dicos me atendieron inmediatamente y me pusieron suero y me recuper en un momento

5673422 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5673423 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5673424 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5673425 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5673426 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5673427 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5673428 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5673429 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5673430 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5673431 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5673432 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5673433 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5673434 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5673435 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5673436 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5673437 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5673438 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5673439 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5673440 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5673441 i am surprised that i got the time i did as i didnt the think the aeroplane would go that fast
5673442 if i can get this time in qualifying then i would be super happy
5673443 these penalties i can easily avoid so i am very pleased
5673444 to be three seconds faster than all the others is a good feeling
5673445 starting last is good to watch what everyone else is doing and it calms you down a little bit as well
5673446 we were very amazed how the guys that fly later were getting faster times
5673447 perhaps the course is moving on the water as time goes on or perhaps they are all just flying faster
5673448 it was an opportunity missed but what can you do
5673449 i was pushing too hard my team and i have won the championship before and we know what we are doing
5673450 the plane needs more speed so we decided to change the engine
5673451 its quite a big job tomorrow morning when it is ready then i will do some hours of flying and then i will be ready for qualification
5673452 today i was feeling that it was a good day
5673453 sure i got two penalties but i can easily avoid them tomorrow and i did very fast net times and to be three seconds faster than all the others is a good feeling for tomorrow
5673454 open source an open question for red hat and others

5673468 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5673469 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5673470 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5673471 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5673472 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5673473 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5673474 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5673475 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5673476 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5673477 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

5673479 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5673480 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5673481 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5673482 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5673483 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5673484 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5673485 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5673486 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5673487 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5673488 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5673489 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5673490 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5673491 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5673492 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5673493 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5673494 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5673495 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5673496 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5673497 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5673498 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5673499 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5673500 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5673501 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5673502 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5673503 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5673504 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5673505 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5673506 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5673507 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5673508 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5673509 thats the first time ive ever done that routine and i wouldnt have medaled without it
5673510 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5673511 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

5673515 embezzlement by an organized group with the use of professional status
5673516 the prosecutor generals office never hid its intentions of silencing and discrediting mikhail khodorkovsky and platon lebedevs lawyers who continually bothered them with procedural violations inconsistencies in the accusations and so on
5673517 there are plenty of opportunities to go after us obviously the investigators will try to form a criminal lawyers syndicate on the basis of the tula case
5673518 we all understand what kind of case we are taking part in so who would even think of that its from the field of fabrication and fantasy
5673519 the advantage we have in stockholm is that weve been away from the london noise where all these investors and hedge funds are talking and end up with the same ideas and the same portfolios

5673531 the church has been preoccupied with the question what happens to your soul after you die as if the reason for jesus coming can be summed up in jesus is trying to help get more souls into heaven as opposed to hell after they die i just think a fair reading of the gospels blows that out of the water i dont think that the entire message and life of jesus can be boiled down to that bottom line
5673532 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer

5673614 if anwr is so small and so filled with oil why not slant drill into it do you really think that the only oil in alaska is directly under anwr seriously
5673615 you do know that the oil companies are only drilling on a fraction of the land they currently have leases for why is that maybe because there are no more rigs to send out no more ships to transport and no more capacity at the refineries we have today have you thought of that phil
5673616 i guess since you are so well versed on oil recovery why do they lease so many acres and only find it on a miniscule percentage they have 68 million acres that have no oil on it
5673617 why do they lease so many acres and only find it on a miniscule percentage
5673618 iraq and afghanistan were supposed to instill fear in the mighty american war machine and make the terrorists think twice about attacking us instead the bush mccain war plan has made us the laughing stock of the planet and emboldened the enemy we have zero credibility we now are the torturers we are the ones with secret ussr like prisons we are the ones who refuse fair trials we are the ones who spy on our own citizens this is what obama brings to the table if its change from bush mccain failed policies thats all we need
5673619 oil drilling in anwr would not impact the u s oil supply for at least a decade
5673620 the opening of anwr would reduce the price of imported low sulfur light crude oil by only 0 75 per barrel in 2025
5673621 oh yeah there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq

5673637 our existing performance review systems were very generic and didnt focus enough on the individual
5673638 we realised they were not progressive enough and we wanted an effective way to show our employees that we were investing in their career development while implementing a high performance culture as part of our overall people strategy to attract train and retain staff we needed the ability to collaborate across the group we also wanted to be more proactive and strategic about managing our training in particular we wanted the ability to identify skills gaps and high performers within the business
5673639 we did a benchmark of suppliers and were very quickly impressed with the level of service insight and expertise from successfactors
5673640 we were particularly impressed with successfactors leadership status and industry expertise in the hotel sector and their track record at helping organisations implement a high performance culture because successfactors is delivered online we can create a dynamic system that directly links to our development and training systems that highlights training skills requirements rather than just a once a year paper based process we will also be able to collaborate across the group enabling senior management to share ideas work together more closely and transparently cascade our group objectives down through the business to provide an overall snapshot of the organisation
5673641 we are delighted to be partnering with successfactors this latest investment forms just one part of our overall global people strategy which includes competency based recruitment and succession planning successfactors provides us with a means by which we can administer and manage our plans in a timely and consistent manner across different hotels and geographies
5673642 we have more than 30 brand name hotel customers around the world and understand that the hotel industry in particular faces a unique set of challenges a transient workforce from multi national backgrounds high churn and a very competitive marketplace particularly in the higher end of the market the lancaster landmark hotel group is a great example of an organisation that understands the role and rewards that effective development collaboration and communication can play in staying both competitive and differentiated by identifying and developing their internal talent lancaster landmark will be able to provide a clear career progression path and precisely identify any skills gaps at the individual employee level while providing senior management with the visibility collaboration and insight at a group level to track and manage company wide performance objectives
5673643 i am not one that believes that isolating russia is the right answer to its misdemeanors i think the right response is hard headed engagement
5673644 i dont expect that we will nor have we sought to accelerate map for georgia
5673645 i think the very fact of the alliance meeting and considering what steps it will take to assist georgia will send a very clear message
5673646 but now russias actions have turned even the doves into hawks
5673647 we said georgia would eventually become a member of nato alongside ukraine and thats certainly the position that we will be advocating today
5673648 there is disproportionate use of violence and we should send also a clear signal that the russian troops should withdraw
5673649 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want to this process to move faster

5673682 we are at risk of entering if there is not a very rapid evolution on the ground into a relationship which will be of a different nature to what it was until now
5673683 we should signal that the agreement should be fulfilled and russian troops should withdraw

5673699 but hes a genuine miracle whether its god or some other higher power i dont know whatever it was that made this happen it sure has a sense of humour not that it funny i mean well
5673700 every time a child is born its a little miracle right there right our miracle is just a little different
5673701 so have you had any contact with vw whats their take on this
5673702 well at first they were pretty silent but recently weve received some letters regarding legal action obviously we cant go into it for legal reasons but its not pleasant hopefully the medical examination results will shut them up to be honest we never expected them to react like that i mean can you think of a better way to get everyone talking about vw
5673703 funny thats exactly what some people have been saying that this is some kind of pr stunt what do you have to say to those people
5673704 its completely ridiculous and not only that insulting child birth is such a sacred process how could fake something like this and live with themselves for any pr company it would be suicide im sure i dont know about anyone else but id be livid if i found out someone and mocked something so special for advertising so to all those doubters out there no this isnt some kind of stunt the last thing we were expecting when we went into that hospital was to come out with a baby car and now we have we just want to be left alone so we can get on with our lives and with raising our son
5673705 what are your plans for the future do you plan on taking the baby to school when hes older are you going to clothe him keep him in the garage you must have a lot of things to think about

5673754 the truth is the substantial amount of investment weve put into this mobile business in the past four years its in the tens of millions of dollars is now ready to go into harvest mode
5673755 we think itll actually be a killer application in the world of mobile phones
5673756 theyre going to the organizations that rely on franklincovey and will listen to them with an open mind
5673757 they actually have a decent pedigree with regard to their technical skills
5673758 but the problem is they carry so much baggage along with their corporate name that getting somebody to take a meeting so they can pitch the product is incredibly difficult im not convinced they can ramp the volume

5673792 offensichtlich ist die vp gesundheitssprecherin auch beim thema tageskliniken nicht auf dem letzten stand denn wien hat selbstverst ndlich eine ausreichende zahl an tagesklinischen betten
5673793 schon jetzt kann jedes systemisierte bett ohne aufwand in ein tagesklinisches bett umgewandelt werden
5673794 dazu kommen 92 tagesklinische betten im akh wo 2007 rund 28 000 patientinnen versorgt werden konnten
5673795 von den etwa 100 000 station ren patientenaufnahmen am allgemeinen krankenhaus der stadt wien und des wiener krankenanstaltenverbundes sind etwa ein drittel tagesklinische aufnahmen
5673796 nach dem neuen modell der leistungsorientierten krankenhausfinanzierung lkf 2009 brauchen k nftig keine eigenen kostenstellen f r tagesklinische leistungen eingerichtet werden
5673797 das hei t dass zuk nftig tagesklinische leistungen in allen bereichen einer krankenanstalt ohne daf r extra ausgewiesene betten erbracht werden k nnen
5673798 erst vor kurzem hat die wiener gesundheits und sozialstadtr tin das dialyse und nephrologiezentrum im wilhelminenspital er ffnet damit erh ht sich die zahl der dialysepl tze im wilhelminenspital auf 32 192 statt bisher 120 patientinnen k nnen behandelt werden au erdem werden bis zum herbst 2009 in einem dialysezentrum auf dem gel nde des donauspitals 72 neue dialysepl tze geschaffen die pl tze werden dann rund 430 patientinnen zur verf gung stehen
5673799 wenn der vp gesundheitssprecherin das thema tageskliniken wirklich so am herzen liegt h tte sie sich schon l ngst bei ihrer vp kollegin gesundheitsministerin andrea kdolsky darum bem hen k nnen dass das lkf system flexibler wird
5673800 durch medizinische fortschritte werden n mlich immer mehr eingriffe und behandlungen so schonend durchf hrbar dass ein aufenthalt der patienten ber nacht entfallen kann eine entsprechende aufnahme dieser leistungen in den tagesklinischen leistungskatalog erfolgt von bundesseite jedoch nur sehr langsam wodurch diese leistungen deutlich schlechter abgegolten werden

5673811 our objective with the initiatives announced here today is to further improve our manufacturing network and processes to minimize operating costs and maximize customer satisfaction
5673812 that includes rationalizing our manufacturing footprint to lower overhead and distribution costs improve operational effectiveness and reduce working capital requirements in doing so we will be better positioned to serve our customers with the products they need manufactured at the right location for the customer and delivered when they need them
5673813 the most mentally challenging sport ive done once your hands touch the bar you cannot hesitate you have to decide youre going to do it you only have that split second you either get it or you fail completely

5673815 a viewer is permitted and even encouraged to ogle an ongoing parade of muscled and lithe and rippling and toned and occasionally highly perplexing bodies
5673816 the nypds latest plan to track and monitor the movements of millions of law abiding people is an assault on this countrys historical respect for the right to privacy and the freedom to be left alone that this is happening without public debate and that elected officials have had no opportunity to study this program is even more alarming
5673817 nyclu nypd plan to track millions of law abiding people is an assault on privacy rights
5673818 city would photograph every vehicle entering manhattan and sniff out radiation
5673819 it is one tool of ensuring that if there is somebody on a terrorist watch list or someone driving erratically or if a pattern develops that raises suspicions it gives them an opportunity to investigate further and if need be track down the drivers or the passengers
5673820 the bottom line is they cant frisk everybody coming into manhattan they cannot wand everyone as they do at airports this is a passive collection of data that is not as personally invasive as what they do at airports
5673821 is it possible for him to do that by himself
5673822 can he build those skills become more confident by himself
5673823 fifa today decided that the 2010 fifa world cup preliminary competition match between georgia and the republic of ireland scheduled for 6 september 2008 will take place at a neutral venue due to recent events in georgia which have affected security in the entire country
5673824 fifa reached this decision after closely monitoring the situation in georgia and taking note that uefa also decided to ask georgian clubs involved in uefa competitions to play their matches in neutral countries
5673825 the georgian football federation has until 26 august 2008 to nominate a neutral venue to host the qualifying match against the republic of ireland which will take place on the scheduled date of 6 september 2008 the georgian football federation will serve as the host association for this match
5673826 ajax coach marco van basten told me that i could be sold if a club showed their interest
5673827 i have told him now that i want to keep on fighting for my place
5673828 i am back after two matches and i am happy because i am meeting the technical staff and the players again
5673829 we have already built a team and this team has played well
5673830 that is why we dont want to recruit new people in the team again but want to prepare for coming games in a stable manner with confidence in ourselves

5673849 we miss the presence of people like him because their presence alone is enough to earn respect from the opposition

5673853 i hope we can do our job well right from the start to earn a place at the world cup
5673854 securing a positive result and putting in a good performance are the most important things
5673855 im happy to be back ive been considered by a new coach the fight for a starting place will be tough so the team will benefit
5673856 some of them play in europe but our goal is to win all our games at home
5673857 on the field it is eleven versus eleven we are all the same and we have a chance to win it
5673858 thats what is making it difficult for dale to choose a starting xi
5673859 weve probably got 16 or 17 guys to choose from
5673860 we are excited to begin the next phase of qualifying
5673861 there are no easy games and we know guatemala are a very difficult team to play at home
5673862 its important to begin the semi final round in a positive way and we are confident that the work we have done in the last 18 months has prepared us for the task
5673863 i feel we are used to each other and weve learnt what they coach wants in training
5673864 we are going in the right direction to play the americans
5673865 this round is going to be tough and for us starting away to cuba will be difficult
5673866 i am not saying we cant get the win but it will not be as easy as people think a world cup qualifier is a different type of game
5673867 i am sure coach kenyon will put a good team on the field
5673868 i think el salvador will finish top in this group
5673869 we dont fear costa rica or any caribbean team but we respect the ticos because they play well
5673870 weve wracked our brains to think of some kind of captive approach we can do by taking it in and rearing it ourselves but it seems to be impossible in australia and possibly around the world

5673876 we have used hct wire saws since the beginning of our manufacturing operations in 2006 and they have continued to demonstrate the performance necessary to deliver high quality cost effective wafers to our customers

5673880 we generally suspect within the industry quite frankly that the appc register is more honoured in the breach than it is in actually being kept to by members the appc we think is not really tough enough on its members it does not have the authority to implement what it actually says it will we think that perhaps the house of commons as a respected institution would be better to organise that
5673881 i cant even be showing you this youre totally out of the demo area but the world is there
5673882 id be lying if i said we didnt have people coming into dealers because of high gas prices
5673883 but weve had that list for a while now and this year were basically just delivering cars
5673884 theres nothing else like it on the road and that distinction gives it an edge
5673885 its the start of a change in tactics in dealing with crowd control and dispersing violent demonstrations and violent instances

5673891 if sony and microsoft perceive this to be a problem then i could see them cut prices

5673893 gives even b and c students more chances than a students in china and india have
5673894 all they are doing now is to blame our teachers and put the burden on our children
5673895 universities are just expert in playing this game that says well sure you completed english composition but you didnt take my class and sort of cheating students out of transfer credits by insisting that they retake essentially the same classes
5673896 roughly 3 500 community college students transferred to kentuckys public universities 100 fewer than in 1997 when the legislature passed education reform
5673897 university requirements that make it difficult to exchange academic credits not enough financial aid or advisers to help students make the jump to four year schools and a reluctance among some universities to aggressively recruit community college students
5673898 sacramento state researchers nancy shulock and colleen moore concluded that 60 percent of the states incoming community college students in 1999 wanted to transfer or earn a degree or certificate about a quarter of those 314 000 students had accomplished their goal six years later
5673899 no excuses lessons from 21 high performing high poverty schools
5673900 and if i ever have a son i think im gonna name him
5673901 by transforming the lives of the kids we serve in our current network of schools and b y inspiring others as we continue to reach more students in more communities to reconsider what is possible in public education
5673902 class struggle whats wrong and right with americas best public high schools
5673903 annual mobility rates ranged from a low of 4 percent to a high of 36 percent across the kipp network with an average rate of 16 percent
5673904 now they pretty much dont leave for anything unless they move out of the state
5673905 who is most likely to leave kipp schools are there indicators such as incoming test scores family home issue etc that we can identify to better provide support for vulnerable students why do students choose to leave kipp when do they leave is it during the first few months of the first school year or later on in the school year how we are best able to retain students
5673906 i dont regret what i did but it will take me three years to recover
5673907 intense disciplined research based and result directed require it and a lot of it we do a lot of teacher training and it does benefit everyone
5673908 principals need the ability to clean house and hire teachers that will continually strive for progress and not give up hope on our children
5673909 it seems to me this would allow for the creation of a motivated core of teachers
5673910 the most common argument against my proposal was always would you want to work in the place where the other students were grouped
5673911 only when students are attended to in ways similar to independent schools will the necessary positive relationships between students and teachers be established
5673912 ninety six percent of our parents last year attended at least one seminar in our program to address parental growth and family issues
5673913 it seems there is very little discussion of what should be happening in the home
5673914 schools which are kept neat and clean and painted with the bathrooms in good shape send a message the student is valued and education is valued it feels good to be in a nice building
5673915 a school without working clocks a hallway without light bulbs
5673916 id be more than willing to go to home depot and buy a few contractor packs of light bulbs and deliver them to the school
5673917 we engage and motivate the students by providing them year round paid internships at our citys most prestigious corporations
5673918 come into the school on a regular basis to discuss the nuts and bolts of life in expensive washington d c about different career paths and what has to be done to achieve their goals
5673919 i have seen firsthand how parents are treated in our schools
5673920 i cant blame them if they do not jump to volunteer

5673934 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5673935 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5673936 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5673937 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5673938 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5673939 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5673940 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5673941 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5673942 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5673943 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5673944 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5673945 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5673946 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5673947 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5673948 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5673949 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5673950 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5673951 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5673952 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5673953 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5673954 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5673955 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5673956 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5673957 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5673958 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5673959 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5673960 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5673961 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5673962 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5673963 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5673964 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5673965 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5673966 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5673967 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5673968 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5673969 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5673970 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5673971 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5673972 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5673973 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5673974 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5673975 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5673976 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5673977 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5673978 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5673979 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5673980 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5673981 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5673982 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5673983 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5673984 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5673985 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5673986 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5673987 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5673988 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5673989 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5673990 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5673991 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5673992 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5673993 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5673994 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5673995 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5673996 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5673997 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5673998 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5673999 this is a planning took where all things are going
5674000 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5674001 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5674002 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5674003 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5674004 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5674005 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5674006 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5674007 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5674008 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5674009 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5674010 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5674011 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5674012 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5674013 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5674014 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5674015 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5674016 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5674017 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5674018 a rea atingida h muitos anos pela viol ncia sect ria e este tamb m um incidente sect rio

5674020 o tiroteio durou cerca de nove horas e temos relatos de que pelo menos 20 militantes foram mortos
5674021 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5674022 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5674023 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5674024 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5674025 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5674026 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5674027 now he is backing federal legislation to give small business contracts to venture capital firms and billionaires i couldnt be more disappointed in this congress and its leaders
5674028 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5674029 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5674030 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5674031 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5674032 it would be easy to give in and let inflation get out of control thats what happened in the 1970s
5674033 but if everyone does it prices will just go up again and well all be back to square one but with inflation still high
5674034 we continue to see pressure on our market and the consumer generally
5674035 acredita se que a atra o entre os humanos resultado da qualidade dos genes e do fen tipo em outras palavras os humanos buscam um parceiro que possa contribuir da melhor forma para a qualidade de sua prole

5674037 the company has said its important that we are different from a historic mining company
5674038 the best way to protect idahos environment and values is to work with companies instead of having an adversarial relationship
5674039 they said they were serious about being good neighbors here
5674040 we continue to see pressure on our market and the consumer generally
5674041 i woke up this morning and got myself a beer
5674042 id be shocked if this is the end based on how hard the california franchise tax board has fought every step of the way for 10 years
5674043 were reviewing the matter and hope to have a decision soon
5674044 he wanted a better place for his business and his life
5674045 there was the added benefit of no nevada income tax
5674046 they saw my client was receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in licensing from his patents
5674047 rather than conduct a fair and impartial audit they essentially went into it to find a way to get money from him
5674048 when so much time is spent on some issues it concerns us i would advice politicians not to spend much time politicking and focus on serving the people
5674049 mps should realise that they were sent to make laws that are not against god
5674050 i dunno these are her car keys she said you would need her car
5674051 do you really think it is ok that we do this in here
5674052 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5674053 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5674054 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5674055 probably fannie mae and freddie mac despite what u s treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
5674056 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
5674057 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
5674058 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5674059 this was a quarter in which we continued development of our marketing and operating infrastructure our efforts to penetrate new market segments and further expand in existing markets are showing results as evidenced by our signing new contracts for installation of both the novel homi our revenues increased this quarter as compared to last quarter this increase was offset by higher production marketing and installment costs related to our substantial investment in marketing and operations we expect this trend to continue and believe that our revenues will continue to increase as we complete new installations we are pleased with the feedback we are receiving from our customers regarding our proprietary innovative minibar solutions we believe that the mid market sector in which we are now focusing marketing efforts has significant growth potential in addition we are continuing to market our products and services to the upscale hotel sector as we have been since we commenced operations the unique advantages of homis products and full outsourcing services enable hotels in all sectors to maximize minibar revenues while providing cost savings
5674060 you should have felt the buzz the moment all five of us got together in the same room for the first time again we all started laughing it was like the five years had never passed we knew wed made the right move
5674061 o psoe non se atreve a criticar ao bng porque ser a facerlle o xogo ao pp
5674062 fuimos superiores y siempre cre mos que pod amos remontar
5674063 it was another frustration every day is something else up here we are so close to having one of the biggest events in this country and the airport shutting down the management of this place needs to be investigated
5674064 i am excited and nervous both at the same time it is great that me and my listeners will be together throughout day and night giving company to each other i know the wishes of the people of chennai are with me and am all geared to complete the record
5674065 dheena has become the most popular rj in chennai because of his sheer hard work focus and dedication and i am sure that he will give all his attention and energy to attempt and succeed in breaking the record we at big 92 7 fm are proud to have him with us and will all be here cheering for him with each passing hour given his passion and love for radio i think big 92 7 fm and dheena are going to keep the listeners happy
5674066 if i could write just one song thats as good as john and pauls worst song id be happy
5674067 a personal attractiveness which enables a person to influence others
5674068 rock and roll doesnt really mean a band it doesnt mean a singer it doesnt mean a lyric really its that question of trying to be immortal
5674069 i wish her all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate in hand
5674070 im just so happy that they get to love each other in such an official way
5674071 being close to the play area was one of my reasons for choosing this location as it is a safe area for my children to play with no major roads adjoining it
5674072 i am disgusted with the news that it has been marked for closure as we frequent it all year round this really is a choice that should have been made by the residents
5674073 we have recently moved and one of the attractions was the convenience of the play area having two young children its important they have somewhere clean and safe to play
5674074 when viewing the property we checked the park for the obvious abuse from teenagers which regularly occurred in the parks at lower earley where we used to live and it was evident that there was none other than names carved in wood on the slide
5674075 since living here there have been no issues with teenagers at night and we regularly use the park as a good way for the children to let off steam get fresh air and exercise
5674076 the council obviously havent been to the area at the weekend when it has a constant stream of users throughout the day admittedly the quiet time is when children are in school as you would expect
5674077 there is money to spend people think there is an enormous trough of money which is not true
5674078 we have a very large squad and we lost 22m when we came down so we have to cover our costs we have done an awful lot of work around the ground
5674079 over the past three years weve spent everything that weve had we try to run the club well and it is a great model but players earn very large salaries too high
5674080 i was happy with the size of the crowd and particularly pleased with selling 14 000 season tickets in the current economic climate there are hard times out there but after this latest win hopefully we can sell a few more
5674081 i dont think we experienced a real sense of doom and gloom
5674082 the boat has been shaken up a bit which was inevitable but i just think the attitude in the camp is very positive and has been for weeks with the culmination of steve coppell staying at the request of the fans
5674083 i just want to play on a winning team and i am looking forward to this season more than i have done in recent years
5674084 i want to win some trophies and i am sure we are going to be close in the league
5674085 we will definitely make the play off semi finals at coventry
5674086 bracknell has got that far ever since they joined the epl
5674087 they won it a couple of years ago and made the final last year so i expect to be at coventry at the very least
5674088 romford have always been at the bottom of the league and the situation is not improving there
5674089 bicks rang me up because he had heard that i wanted a change
5674090 i gave my all at romford but it was time to move on
5674091 i would not say that goalscoring is my main strength although i do score goals
5674092 it is hard to say what i do best but i suppose you could say my checking or my work rate
5674093 hutchins was a good scorer in the elite league and i think he would do very well in the epl
5674094 the tragedy of a fate that condemns berlin forever to become and never to be
5674095 this has been a dream of mine since i was a little kid
5674096 i feel like my childhood dreams are coming true and you cant get any better than that
5674097 its great to seal the deal with two races left thats a big check off on my lifetime goals
5674098 im very proud of my season it was more stressful than last year when no one expected me to win
5674099 im sorry for the way the downhill cup finished i would have preferred that we had a last race so it would be fair for both of us
5674100 i still have a big day on thursday with the super g it would be amazing to win another title
5674101 its amazing to be back on the podium and id really like gold next time
5674102 if jonathan calder didnt exist wed probably have to invent him
5674103 during that 60 day period these were contemplated decisions and now they are no longer contemplated decisions this makes it all a little more concrete
5674104 we say it will make decatur the mining truck capital of the world
5674105 we view this as being very positive for caterpillar and our decatur facility
5674106 wed like to have our cake and eat it too
5674107 i can only confirm the b sample test has come positive but the results of both tests are different which is strange to us

5674112 per liraq e meglio non parlare di calendario e bene parlare di risultati da ottenere delliraq e meglio parlare in termini di successo della nostra presenza e di volonta del governo iracheno di consentire la presenza delle forze estere sul proprio territorio cioe fino a quando si sentira sicuro di avere proprie truppe da noi addestrate idonee a garantire la sicurezza del paese a quel punto ci diranno che non hanno piu bisogno di noi e noi ce ne andremo

5674207 we had a couple of early chances for twos and the whole week ive been making those
5674208 there has been a couple of time that the ice has actually confused us a couple curled and a couple went straighter we just got baffled a little by that
5674209 the shot in the seventh inning kevin martin played a great hit it was the only place he could have put it and he put it there and mine just curled about 2mm too far and we never got a two out of it its a bit of bad luck
5674210 it was a high risk shot but to be honest i didnt have an awful lot else it was the only shot and it was only millimetres from making it sometimes thats the difference in curling a couple of millmetres here and there and you lose the game
5674211 weve had a great season graeme connel come on board and weve won the europeans and made the final here
5674212 i am disappointed i didnt make the world cup finals and wish i knew why it had happened
5674213 i realise it takes more than perfect preparation to become the best skier in the world
5674214 three top 20 results was not bad but i expected so much more
5674215 he greber had taken me as far as he could and he did not know what else to do to make me go any faster
5674216 i needed a fresh approach and mark will provide that
5674217 my starts have not been consistent so this is one of my main aims to work on this summer
5674218 it was one of those that if i won everyone would say shes been to the olympics so she should win and if i hadnt it would have been really embarrassing
5674219 so it was a mixture of joy and relief to win at the brits
5674220 it was the first race she had ever done i am so proud of her
5674221 i definitely feel i have got a good chance of getting a medal its a question of getting everything right in the build up to give myself the best chance of everything going right on that day
5674222 if the olympic games were held tomorrow zoe would be one of five or six vying for the gold medal
5674223 chemmy has skied really well in patches but she has not really had a good consistent season in terms of results
5674224 there ought to be no excuses now we all know chemmy has got the potential its just a question of putting the right programme in place to allow her to do that
5674225 alain is probably going to take some time over the next couple of months to think about it
5674226 the desire is still there and in training he is still our fastest slalom skier its not quite happening on the hill
5674227 zoes had a fantastic season as a person she has really stepped up a level and is high on confidence
5674228 and lesley has had a really good comeback its the first season she has been fully fit for two or three years
5674229 she has proved she can still compete at the top level the fourth place at the bardonecchia world cup was an excellent result

5674464 the traditional approach to modelocking is to use a two section device one section to provide optical gain the other to act as a saturable absorber
5674465 we have been investigating a single section device which is modelocked over the entire current range above threshold
5674466 we now have excellent control of the dot growth producing high dot densities with narrow size distributions resulting in a high performance gain medium
5674467 this allows the observation of self pulsation and the high peak powers required to observe dual band modelocking
5674468 the splitting of the laser peak at twice threshold is purely a coincidence
5674469 we believe the splitting is decided by the intracavity ac stark effect with the separation between peaks being twice the rabi frequency once the rabi frequency which is dependent on the intracavity laser intensity is comparable with the initial lasing linewidth we observe the dual wavelength modelocking

5674567 over the last five years its just amazing how safetynet has caught on i know that the project executives meet on a regular basis to discuss observations whos making them and which jobs are doing better than others this information that we collect is something thats carried all the way up to the top and trickles back down

5674581 eigentlich habe ich mir vorgestellt in chelsea zu bleiben und mich dort durchzusetzen aber dann kam klaus und hat mich berzeugt nach bremen zur ckzukommen
5674582 wir haben uns schon im letzten jahr um claudio bem ht als er den fc bayern verlassen hat aber damals war der transfer f r uns nicht zu machen
5674583 wir haben kontakt gehalten und sind vor ein paar monaten in ernsthafte gespr che eingestiegen die letztlich zu dieser vereinbarung gef hrt haben
5674584 er ist ein absoluter topst rmer der mit seinem k nnen und seiner erfahrung sehr wertvoll f r uns sein wird
5674585 die mannschaft hat die qualit t titel zu holen und daf r bin ich hier
5674586 vom kopf her bin ich auf jeden fall bereit aber ich habe zuletzt wegen einer wadenzerrung in der vorbereitung noch kein spiel gemacht da muss ich erst sehen wie es geht
5674587 wenn sein schuss rein gegangen w re h tte das ergebnis anders aussehen k nnen
5674588 wir haben uns mit dem spieler geeinigt und eine zusage seines klubs
5674589 als die zuschauer mir den mittelfinger gezeigt haben wu te ich es ist wie immer
5674590 he served 22 years with great vision and integrity and all who love wake forest are grateful for his legacy of achievement and the place the institution holds in american higher education

5674592 that was a major step in the history of wake forest
5674593 every aspect of the workings of zimbawe cricket including the allegation that only members of ruling party zanu pf are eligible to play
5674594 zimbabwe has agreed not to participate in the wider interest of cricket
5674595 but we will continue to be a full member of the icc and welcome any team that wants to play against us
5674596 we voluntarily agreed to back out of the world twenty20 because we were told we wont get visas to england we dont want to gatecrash where we are not welcome
5674597 by agreeing to withdraw from the world twenty20 zimbabwe have agreed to act in the interests of world cricket thus avoiding the likelihood of that tournament being moved elsewhere and the added spectre of boycotted matches and possibly strikes by players
5674598 i welcome the fact that zimbabwe will not play in the world twenty20 in england next year
5674599 the government made it clear that in the current circumstances the team whose figurehead is mr mugabe would not be welcome
5674600 while i would have preferred the icc to take a stronger stance against zimbabwe cricket this solution still allows individual cricket authorities to make their own choices over whether to play zimbabwe
5674601 this will allow the twenty20 tournament in england to go ahead
5674602 it also sends a powerful message to zimbabwe that the government must change or face further isolation
5674603 this matter led to a complex and lengthy series of negotiations
5674604 weve had long discussions with our colleagues on the icc over the last three days and were grateful they saw the point of view we held
5674605 we dont live in a vacuum people can see whats going on and politicians are making political decisions based on the political situation in zimbabwe
5674606 as a sporting organisation we make decisions based on cricket and even if we wanted to its unlikely political considerations are at the forefront
5674607 so much the better if that happens i think they need to take a stance
5674608 its a hard subject for me to discuss because i hate whats going on there but banning a team or banning a game of cricket will that change the situation in zimbabwe the answers probably no
5674609 obviously ireland is a very important fixture for us theyre the team we measure ourselves against just now at associate level
5674610 but new zealand is another opportunity for us to get ourselves a test scalp theres no pressure on us there
5674611 its just a chance to see if we can pull something off and see what we can do
5674612 in the past thereve been chances to show the strength of feeling here and the government chose not to
5674613 if it comes down to players to do that well definitely have to look at it
5674614 theres a great sense among the general population that our last tour to zimbabwe shouldnt have gone ahead
5674615 it has come down to a certain extent to personal preference and there have been some tough decisions made in previous tours
5674616 when we come round to the issue again we all hope that the political situation in zimbabwe is very different
5674617 but if it isnt there are going to be more very difficult decisions to be made
5674618 we will have it after the ipl or well try to fit it in at a later time it is a minor thing
5674619 all bilateral arrangements are suspended with zimbabwe cricket with immediate effect
5674620 the ecb deplores the position in zimbabwe and like csa finds this untenable
5674621 we welcome the governments decision and share the governments concerns about the deteriorating situation and lack of human rights in zimbabwe
5674622 we want to ensure that zimbabwe do not tour england next year
5674623 we will call on other countries to join us in banning zimbabwe
5674624 the only acceptable non compliance as its called is a clear instruction from government or a security situation
5674625 the secretary of state burnham made it clear there was a clear instruction and we have acted to it straight away
5674626 the right thing to do was to provide clarity we made the decision after giving it the longest possible time for the situation to change in zimbabwe
5674627 i hope the cricketing community in this country and the wider world will understand the reasons why i have done that
5674628 we do have contingency plans in case any tour is cancelled
5674629 we are already in consultation with other boards about the possibility of another country coming in to play two tests and three one day internationals at the start of next year to replace exactly the programme zimbabwe would have undertaken
5674630 the ecb looked for this sort of reaction from the government to stop them going on tour to zimbabwe in 2004
5674631 but the government didnt give them that and they had to go and felt very uncomfortable about it
5674632 that is part of the hosting agreement for any major world event but we cant second guess on how the icc meeting will progress next week
5674633 unless zimbabwe are suspended from the icc next week it still has the right to play international tournaments
5674634 it is a very delicate situation for the government and the ecb seven out of 10 around the table at the icc have to vote to expel zimbabwe
5674635 we recognised we british government are not the principal decision makers here this is a tournament organised by the icc but we have made our views explicitly clear

5674643 the amount of money that can be earned is completely up to the ambassador as we expand across america we are hoping that the people from the adirondacks can grow with us as well
5674644 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5674645 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5674646 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home

5674661 travel planner nu este un portal turistic pentru ca noi ne vindem propriile pachete de vacanta
5674662 mai sunt si alte agentii care activeaza si online insa noi incercam sa ne concentram majoritar pe vanzarile online ceea ce ne diferentiaza este faptul ca vom incorpora site uri specializate pentru fiecare destinatie in parte
5674663 activam pe o piata incipienta in ceea ce priveste alegerea si achizitionarea serviciilor de turism online
5674664 am ales bulgaria ca prim proiect in cadrul travel planner nu neaparat pentru ca romanii in special bucurestenii prefera aceasta destinatie ci pentru ca raportul calitate pret este bun iar locatia este aproape astfel incat putem atinge si partea de organizare evenimente si team bulding uri
5674665 lunile martie si aprilie au fost slabe cu vanzari putine am recuperat ulterior insa tot am ratat cu circa 10 planurile noastre de afaceri la jumtatea anului oricum in prezent vindem in medie 6 7 echipamente telecom pe zi comparat cu unul sau doua anul trecut in aceeasi perioada
5674666 rezultatele inregistrate ne dau motive sa credem ca vom atinge nivelul de crestere propus desi mai avem de recuperat pentru a fi in grafic suntem increzatori ca trimestrul al treilea va marca o revenire la normal in acest sens mentinem tinta de 0 5 milioane euro estimata pana la finele lui 2008 nefiind necesara deocamdata nici o corectie
5674667 in planul de afaceri initial profitabilitatea este asteptata abia la inceputul lui 2009 in acest sens suntem deocamdata in grafic in sensul ca am reusit sa mentinem un echilibru al cheltuielilor curente cu profitul realizat cu toate ca au existat o serie de investitii majore in infrastructura it inclusiv software marirea echipei si marketing suntem in etapa de dezvoltare
5674668 este din ce in ce mai greu sa gasesti oameni capabili
5674669 ne asteptam ca investitia realizata sa fie acoperita de veniturile pe care le vom obtine la finalul evenimentului si probabil va ramane si un mic profit in conditiile in care 20 din venituri vor acoperi onorariile vorbitorilor
5674670 piata romaneasca nu este inca suficient de atragatoare pentru vedetele presei mondiale redactori de la publicatii internationale de prestigiu strategi de presa si new media etc puterea de negociere ajunge in final la argumentul financiar

5674732 our patients have been asking for a way to solve a number of skin issues without the need for surgery or multiple procedures california lifestyles almost guarantee an unpleasant change in skin texture and color balance with evidence of premature aging the natural progression of collagen breakdown eventually presents itself by way of wrinkles and skin laxity the re pair laser targets all these issues with a short downtime one time procedure
5674733 granted in the case of severe laxity the re pair does not replace traditional plastic surgery but when used correctly in the hands of a skilled and experienced laser physician it can provide a single treatment solution to the multiple problems created by sun damage and the initial laxity caused by aging were successfully treating patients well into their 60s before the re pair laser there was no way you could get this multiple effect response without serious and complicated recovery time
5674734 we are using the re pair clinically to improve the surface plane of the skin for those suffering from acne scarring

5674801 so it would be strange that the only sport to take action on so called current worries is cricket when all the other world sporting bodies have not taken that stance
5674802 i cannot speculate on the outcome but we have obviously noted the actions of others
5674803 over the last few years there have been problems between england and zimbabwe this is not a new phenomena
5674804 so you made the navy seem like a lot of work do you enjoy it would you do it all over again

5674816 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5674817 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5674818 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5674819 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5674820 up until that point i dont think they thought anyone had noticed them
5674821 this is nothing shes an old friend of mine leave us alone
5674822 i learned to live on a tight budget in college years ago now its my sons turn to do it and he better do it well as prices have skyrocketed and im footing part of the bill
5674823 most college students could use information on how to live on a budget stretch the few dollars they do have and especially find deals on the items they need we try to provide this sort of useful information in a practical and sometimes humorous way
5674824 weve tried to simplify saving money while presenting our tips in a slightly unorthodox way
5674825 where else can college students get useful information ranging from cheap textbooks to cheap dates

5674827 the most important thing caregivers can do is to educate themselves on their responsibilities once theyve taken on this role
5674828 its not easy and can be further complicated by the emotional involvement the caregiver often has with the person theyre caring for be it a spouse parent other close relative or friend
5674829 its also important however that caregivers recognize they are not alone and that they seek help when they need it
5674830 inevitably when you begin talking about someones healthcare financial matters come into play so you want to designate someone you can trust who will be able to look at the whole picture
5674831 as a caregiver with power of attorney you are acting on another persons behalf
5674832 you want to make sure that you have a very clear understanding of what the individual you are caring for wants and that you truly are committed to acting in their best interest
5674833 just as you do with your own financial records as a caregiver you want to set up a system so that you can keep track of all the important documents of the individual for whom you are caring remember you really are stepping into their shoes you are responsible for making sure you know where things are and what needs to be done when
5674834 many working adults dont set up monthly budgets so long as the money coming in is far more than the money going out or needed for savings this lack of planning can work
5674835 but when youre dealing with an individual that has a disability that is likely increasing their healthcare costs and keeping them from ever returning to full time work good planning is essential
5674836 two thirds of ssdi applications are rejected and the average time it now takes from initial application through appeals to get an award is two to four years given all the responsibilities a caregiver has getting help from a representative reduces the burden substantially
5674837 while these plans can be costly they can be an essential financial planning component for individuals unable to get any other insurance and facing mounting healthcare costs while awaiting medicare eligibility
5674838 not all medicare plans are created equal and people often opt for the traditional plan thinking its the safe choice but for people with disabilities medicare advantage plans often are the optimal choice you cant be turned away for coverage due to a pre existing condition they usually cost less than a traditional medicare and supplemental plan combined and most medicare advantage plans include prescription drug coverage

5674846 the sting of last seasons playoff loss to philadelphia and the controversial call that played such a key part in the games outcome still lingers my teammates and i still have some unfinished business to take care of i believe were on the verge of a special 2009 season given our mix of youth athleticism toughness and experience the backing of new ownership coupled with our strong play can only help entrench the dragons into the mainstream of the new york sports and entertainment scenes i want to be a key part of that effort
5674847 the re signing of aaron garcia illustrates the new ownerships commitment to building a consistent winner and dynamic football team for new york sports fans
5674848 aaron is quite possibly the most exciting player in the game today and without a doubt the games most prolific passer i cant wait to start our 2009 camp and begin to lay the groundwork for an offense that will feature not only the games best quarterback but also a group of dynamic young receivers including keron henry jason willis and terry moss

5674850 we discovered that by going through makes smr process which begins with an interview round with the key stakeholders we were able to relate to each other in new and constructive ways that would have been difficult without an independent third party leading the conversations
5674851 although it may seem somewhat obvious or trivial on first blush
5674852 getting everyone on the same page strategically and tactically was key and im sure many cios would agree that this is not easy to do as we worked through the goals plans and realities of our organization together coupled with the deep technical analysis of our existing it applications and infrastructure that the make team provided we were able to come up with a strategic and realistic roadmap that is supported by the key stakeholders including the executive team furthermore the educational component that make has woven throughout their smr process made it all happen more easily
5674853 new beats old nearly every day the countervailing effects of renovations and obsolescence on hotel price
5674854 my analysis suggests that renovation money is well spent on middle aged properties that are positioned in strong markets with good locations
5674855 although outside events do remove some hotels many properties survive to increase in value during their middle years thus i urge owners to analyze todays renovation expenses against this future value

5674861 we have essentially equated the ability of a larger electricity user to shift its demand for electricity a couple times a year from high peak to off peak periods to a power plant supplying power to the grid
5674862 it is a simple recognition that reducing demand in these grid tenuous times is as good if not better than simply adding more supply to what is already an over extended transmission infrastructure
5674863 we have been participating in a program similar to powerpay new york for a number of years and are proud of the success we have had in reducing our electricity consumption through the years
5674864 ecs is a great local company with a knowledgeable and friendly team making our participation in demand response extremely easy

5674967 90210 redux are going to have to wait a bit longer
5674968 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere
5674969 were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5674970 by refusing to send screeners of the 90210 premiere to critics the cw has aroused deep suspicions
5674971 90210 is already generating a zip codes worth of interest thanks in part to the speculation without any reviews the network and studio probably feel as if reviews would only hurt that stream of press and publicity

5674977 christians believe that marriage is a gift from god in the marriage ceremony the couple make a public declaration of a life long commitment to love one another come what may to anticipate a marriages breakdown before it has even begun completely undercuts its christian basis
5674978 personally i wouldnt marry a person who wanted to impose one on me
5674979 if you knew that your spouse whom you were supposed to trust 100 per cent had imposed that on you wouldnt it affect the marriage from the beginning and if the agreement was for a period of years before it came up for review wouldnt you be thinking about what was going to happen at the end of that period whether you were going to be chucked out
5674980 and i think thats fair because if the person who wants the pre nup and stands to benefit from it still has to persuade the court that its fair and reasonable then that strikes the right balance if you reverse that burden then it becomes doubly unfair to the recipient

5674983 he was sailing very fast forced all his opposition to tack away and he made a tactical error and didnt go with them
5674984 they got a 30 degree wind shift and they were gone
5674985 hes not feeling very happy its a mistake and he hasnt made any in this regatta so its all on tomorrow
5674986 hes good enough that he can come out and beat these guys
5674987 hes sailed really well in the early part of the regatta and the last two days hes not quite nailed it
5674988 whether thats the other guys getting better but we always knew it was going to be pretty close
5674989 hes a strong sailor as long as he can keep his nerves together and if they have slightly stronger winds i think hell be okay
5674990 that really light stuff its tricky its not sailing i really hope he does it because one of us has to hes put the hard work in but the olympics is a funny thing
5674991 i won today but it didnt mean anything in a grand scheme of things
5674992 its not really what i came here to do and it just left me thinking what could have been too many expensive races during the regatta through no lack of trying though
5674993 weird yes tacky absolutely highlight of your trip to nz maybe not
5674994 lonely planet seems to think that stonehenge aotearoa is an imitation of stonehenge in britain but this is completely wrong

5675003 i only stopped antibiotics two days ago so its bloody hard to compete like that youre always slightly on the backfoot because you just havent got the oomph
5675004 i was completely off the pace from the beginning so even getting to the medal race was pretty good
5675005 i dont know what im doing yet but im just going to have a break maybe if its windy in london we might go but were definitely not going to race in qingdao again
5675006 im clear absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5675007 i was so mad i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into take care of business mode which was i asked them what do i do now what what is it that i do
5675008 i get a doctor i get a surgeon i get an oncologist
5675009 we in the south pacific take democracy seriously which is why we believe we cant sit idly by while our principles of democracy are shredded
5675010 its a hard race to be in when someones going that quick and youre just trying to get used to racing again
5675011 hopefully he runs out of steam for the finals but at the moment yeah its a great paddle
5675012 the quality of paddlers here is fantastic theyve definitely stepped it up a gear every year its getting quicker and quicker
5675013 my goal is to get in the final and re evaluate from there
5675014 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5675015 la chica que dec a ser polic a y su novio se abalanzaron sobre uno de los guardias civiles propin ndole varias patadas
5675016 a favor de suscitar el enfrentamiento corporativo entre cuerpos policiales por el perjuicio al servicio p blico de seguridad que prestamos y por la mala imagen que de cara al ciudadano puede dejar
5675017 y por lo tanto vamos a respetar y a no interferir en su pronunciamiento sobre los mismos
5675018 hacer ciertas matizaciones que los sindicatos policiales que se han pronunciado han omitido con una total falta de coherencia
5675019 que estaban de servicio y fueron requeridas para actuar por la supuesta actitud de esta persona hija del intendente jefe de la polic a local de orihuela que adem s se encontraba de fiesta y fuera de servicio en un local
5675020 esta delegaci n muestra su apoyo y el m ximo respeto a los guardias civiles que estando de servicio fueron requeridos para actuar y as lo hicieron cumpliendo con su obligaci n
5675021 we spent almost 10 hours on the ship without toilets it was disgusting
5675022 engineers worked to resolve this issue through the night and it was resolved at approximately 0705am after passengers disembarked the ship
5675023 the ship was disgusting and it should not have sailed
5675024 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5675025 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5675026 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5675027 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5675028 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5675029 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5675030 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5675031 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5675032 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5675033 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5675034 not bad for a nation with no pools and not much soap
5675035 i think you will finish ahead of us in gold
5675036 whether you get there in the overall medals well you should
5675037 the real test is to maintain it afterwards we surprised a lot of people in athens by coming fourth with fewer medals being required we dont want to surrender those objectives thats our message to our government thats why we have got to secure some additional funding to be competitive
5675038 the key is funding and coaching the keys are talent identification direct athlete assistance coaching international coaching sports science and back up
5675039 i am not surprised at britains improvement after sydney won the games we went from 27 medals in barcelona to 41 in atlanta we went up to 58 in sydney thats why we were highlighting britain was going to be a major threat if it hadnt happened there ought to have been a national inquiry
5675040 i said at the outset and my sense of pride says that we cant let great britain beat us and they may well beat us this time but lets use that as the incentive to get the planning right for our high performance and our attack on london 2012
5675041 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5675042 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5675043 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5675044 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5675045 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5675046 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5675047 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5675048 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5675049 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5675050 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5675051 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5675052 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5675053 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5675054 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5675055 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5675056 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5675057 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5675058 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5675059 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5675060 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5675061 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5675062 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5675063 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5675064 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5675065 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5675066 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5675067 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5675068 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5675069 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5675070 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5675071 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5675072 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5675073 i watched the olympics as a kid and i knew id be here it was tough but its all worth it
5675074 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5675075 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5675076 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5675077 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5675078 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5675079 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5675080 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5675081 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5675082 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5675083 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5675084 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5675085 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5675086 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5675087 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5675088 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5675089 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5675090 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5675091 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5675092 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5675093 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5675094 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5675095 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5675096 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5675097 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5675098 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5675099 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5675100 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5675101 who are open to doing something on the production side
5675102 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5675103 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5675104 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5675105 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5675106 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5675107 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5675108 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5675109 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5675110 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5675111 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5675112 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

5675152 one thing that we showed in the paper was that there was immunity to multiple tumour antigens with increase after the t cell infusion
5675153 not just the one we were targeting but at least two others so it may be a general immune activation
5675154 cd4 cells are similar however they dont usually play the role of actually attacking cells
5675155 theyre the ones that we call helper cells and they tend to secrete cytocines and growth factors for other immune cells to help coordinate the immune system
5675156 i think its very difficult to assume that its going to work in all sorts of other cancers
5675157 melanoma is interesting because its always had a history of people observing spontaneous regressions of the disease which suggests the immune system does have something specific to do
5675158 other diseases may not be as responsive so that will have to be part of the testing

5675161 an intriguing possibility however is that caffeine can help prevent or ameliorate depression
5675162 if you give an athlete more petrol in the tank they will go further what weve done is to give them 50 60 per cent more petrol
5675163 it has been incredibly hard for exercise physiologists to help athletes in this way and its a dilemma that has occupied researchers for decades we asked athletes to ingest caffeine which has no nutritional benefit and the results were astounding
5675164 we found that the amount of carbohydrate that could be stored by the muscles when ingested along with caffeine was about 60 per cent higher than with carbohydrates alone
5675165 the practical outcome of that is that an athlete training or competing the next day will have a better training session or race
5675166 caffeine has a wonderful effect on both short term sprint performance and on endurance it is a remarkable drug that affects both ends of the spectrum

5675260 there have been persistent reports that the government is planning to merge the human rights commission with the office of the data protection commissioner and the equality authority
5675261 all of the bodies referred to so far were established by statute and it would require amending legislation to alter their status however the human rights commission is unique in that it is established as a result of a commitment made in the good friday agreement
5675262 the agreement signed by the then taoiseach on behalf of the government on good friday 1998 says that the irish government will establish a human rights commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to that within northern ireland
5675263 the fianna fail government was never enthusiastic about the establishment of the human rights commission the legislation was not finally enacted until 2001 and the government has consistently ignored reports and recommendations it has published since then
5675264 it now seems that the tightened exchequer situation is going to be used to neuter organisations like the human rights commission and the equality authority that have been critical of the government

5675304 family shows coming in such as concerts are going to absorb the sound so its not just bouncing off like it would in a barn its going to hit the barrier and come back soft so it will project a good sound for listeners
5675305 the only way this can be stopped is to re open the debate the only way to do that is through a new council
5675306 it will take a new council to defeat this approach
5675307 i feel this should now be in the hands of the electorate which will go to the polls on november 15 and encourage everyone to consider asking every candidate if they will vote to defeat the appeal of the covenant my answer is already that i will
5675308 approximately 1800 new boat slips will be added over the next five years with 1400 of those for private use in addition there are plans for dock storage for 315 boats with the potential for more
5675309 we found 77 what we called points of interest and narrowed that down to 47 those could be anything from a boat launch to a marina to mooring buoys
5675310 i think this re establishes what some of us on city council have been saying for quite a while that we have a major shortage of facilities for boats im kind of shocked about 40 per cent of the people have some sort of boat which is very eye opening
5675311 just thinking of alternative places of storing trailers i think we really need to be out of the box on that there is the notion of valet service
5675312 i think of schools for example and all the parking lots that are vacant in the summertime maybe the school district could make a deal to rent parking lots and putting some money back into the school system
5675313 city council is seeking greater clarity in the judgment the court determined that the covenant is not valid but does exist as a charitable trust
5675314 the city will ask the appeal court to clarify whether it is possible to create a trust under common law

5675320 this poor animal his chain was too long he had too much mobility in the back of the truck and he took advantage of it there are proper ways to secure a dog the best being having them ride inside the vehicle with a pet restraint or a secured crate if they are travelling in the back of a truck
5675321 for the most part people just dont realize how to secure their dog properly they think any length of chain or rope is fine because thats how theyve always done it i feel so bad for the family of this dog they were well meaning by using a chain to secure it they didnt mean for this happen they did have him restricted but it just wasnt enough
5675322 there is a fine of 109 under the motor vehicle act for failure to properly secure an animal while in transport but i dont think a lot of people know that
5675323 most of the calls we get about dogs in cars are to do with them trapped in vehicles on hot days people are starting to call in more and more about that because they are becoming familiar with the bylaw

5675353 pilot mark believes the myth that the plane will be held in place by the belt
5675354 additionally the obvious intention of the myth is to give a clear difference in the possible outcomes either it flies or it is held stationary and measuring the speed relative to the ground will never give this clear difference even a car will achieve a speed relative to the ground of half the speed shown on its speedometer so much so that if a plane was fitted with wings which caused it to take off at 50mph it could achieve a speed of 100mph on the speedometer and it would take off
5675355 if you put a plane on a treadmill will it be able to take off

5675450 who could have foreseen tom cruise nearly stealing the movie in a fat suit a prosthetic nose a skinhead wig and an austin powers style mat of chest fur

5675588 evidence based clinical practice guidelines strongly recommend that elderly trauma patients be treated as aggressively as non elderly patients
5675589 however some studies have suggested that age bias may still exist in trauma care even in the prehospital phase of that care
5675590 the problem of age bias raised in this study may negate efforts to improve clinical care for elderly trauma patients within trauma centers if the system as a whole does not function properly and deliver patients appropriately to needed resources
5675591 however it may be difficult to change attitudes of age bias and may require a broad societal campaign nevertheless it may be possible to address this problem without directly addressing age bias a focus on retraining the providers about triage protocols may be sufficient
5675592 additionally it may be helpful to highlight the literature that now suggests that elderly trauma patients do in fact return to productive lives after their injury which can eliminate the perception of futility of care that may be used consciously or subconsciously to justify age bias
5675593 they have some concerns but they also think it could possibly be done

5675632 if banned books are a particular feature of the political landscape in the mainland it is exactly the opposite in the hong kong marketplace where the label banned is practically a guarantee of sales
5675633 they really gouge authors and i cant take it when i buy an isbn in hong kong it costs me just one third to one half of what id pay at a mainland publisher
5675634 in my estimation in ten years mainland works may become the mainstream of the hong kong book market
5675635 it saddens me when im called a businessman or a political figure
5675636 the existence of mirror books for the last twenty years demonstrates the reality of one country two systems it is the best proof that hong kong guarantees a free press
5675637 this novel is really something its too bad no one reads fiction these days
5675638 how about this well put out a taiwan edition and then help you do one for hong kong what do you say
5675639 looking back now my worries were unnecessary one country two systems is a long term strategy of the communist party not just the most expedient option like many people were saying at the time
5675640 i dont have the heart to read most of the manuscripts were sent because its torture most of them are individual accounts of experiences during the anti rightist movement and the cultural revolution its not that the quality is bad its just that they marketplace cant absorb so many personal memoirs we cant make a living publishing them but if we dont i cant take the authors response to being rejected i feel as if ive let them down
5675641 this book is the embodiment of my whole lifes worth
5675642 to tell the truth my greatest hope for mirror is just to keep it going not to expand it
5675643 in all its years mirror has never accepted any government funding and it has never taken on any commercial investment it relies entirely on publishing i did things this way because i wanted to maintain mirror books identity as an independent news publisher
5675644 beijing is quite tolerant of me and very polite ive never felt any pressure or harassment
5675645 we hunanese have that sort of temperament if youre polite to us we reign it in a little so this might be one of the things putting mirror and china media net on a more moderate road i dont really want to play the role of the political opposition what i want to do is establish a platform for the expression of many voices and views

5675659 het aantal verkeersdoden moet verder naar omlaag maar we verwachten van de staatssecretaris een grondig en globaal voorstel in plaats van enkele losse ideetjes die op geen enkele manier zijn doorgepraat binnen de regering
5675660 onlangs bleek dat het bivv in feite het reeds lang aangekondigde bart project belgian accident research team nog moet opstarten het is droevig vast te stellen dat er zoveel uitspraken gebeuren over verkeersveiligheid terwijl het in ons land nog mangelt aan degelijk onderzoek naar ongevallenomstandigheden

5675663 the good news is its consistent the higher your vitamin d status the lower the risk of your developing a hip fracture
5675664 we conclude that low serum vitamin d concentrations are associated with an increased risk for hip fracture in community dwelling women the mechanism of association is unclear
5675665 if you dont have inadequate vitamin d you cannot efficiently absorb calcium
5675666 vitamin d also helps maintain bone health by keeping bone cells active
5675667 to get vitamin d levels to where they need to be to reduce the risk of hip fracture you need to be taking at least 1 000 international units of vitamin d a day from a supplement
5675668 they need to ask their doctor for the right test
5675669 women should strive to keep your vitamin d levels above 125 nanomoles per liter year round to do that they are going to require supplements
5675670 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
5675671 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5675672 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
5675673 reducing the psychosocial impact of acne is considered one of the guiding principles for its clinical management and it is important to measure and evaluate this impact
5675674 knowledge of these patient preferences may help dermatologists balance clinical trial results with patients expectations of therapy
5675675 randomized blinded placebo controlled clinical trials have shown that three to four months of conventional acne therapy including topical benzoyl peroxide topical retinoids and oral antibiotics typically produces reductions in lesion counts in the 40 percent to 60 percent range
5675676 it has also been suggested that the incidence of scarring from facial acne approaches 95 percent thus adolescents marked preference for total clearance over partial 50 percent clearance or clearance with scarring suggests that physicians must weigh high patient expectations against these clinical data
5675677 it is important that people with epilepsy and their caregivers take steps to prevent these tragedies
5675678 people with active epilepsy should shower instead of bathe take medication regularly to control seizures and should have direct supervision when swimming
5675679 in conclusion we feel that the evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of stay
5675680 the potential benefits to individual patients in health economics terms are such that a well designed large scale blinded randomized controlled trial with a placebo arm is warranted to answer the question of whether gum chewing can significantly reduce the length of stay after abdominal surgery or whether it merely represents a placebo effect
5675681 what i found out is that combustion generated particles contain environmentally persistent free radicals
5675682 when the radicals are associated with particles they can apparently exist indefinitely
5675683 the implication is you can have the same environmentally related diseases by exposure to airborne fine particles that you can get from cigarettes
5675684 these airborne free radicals are of interest but i am not sure we are at a point where our scalpel is sharp enough to dissect the individual components of air pollution that cause problems for people
5675685 there are studies that show that modifying free radicals can alter the course of disease
5675686 but the implications of this what it means to clinics what it means to doctors what it means to regulators i think we are a long way from pulling that together
5675687 most people have a notion that elderly people have very weak immunity or they have lost immunity
5675688 this study shows that extremely elderly people have retained memory of being infected with the 1918 flu even 90 years later
5675689 its important to know that you can develop immunity to such a pandemic virus that has implications for new pandemic viruses
5675690 the elderly might be a very good donor source for finding antibodies against viruses
5675691 this study shows that humans can develop very potent immune responses against dangerous influenza that cause pandemics
5675692 it gives us hope that we can develop vaccines and antibody treatments for any other pandemic viruses that come along
5675693 the implication of this study is the 1918 virus was so powerful that the immunity you had to have in order to survive was so prominent that it lasted for the rest of your life
5675694 so those in certain age groups who had seen a related virus had the strongest responses
5675695 either they died or they developed a profound immune response
5675696 and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerized simulation of driving
5675697 and i wouldnt want to instill fear in drivers but i think that perhaps individuals who are taking these medications should just be aware of the fact that they may cause concentration problems and impair reaction time
5675698 this issue is not just a question for drivers because the cognitive skills needed for driving are also needed for a lot of other skills
5675699 there is already a very deep literature about subtle impairments of higher cognitive function associated with clinical depression itself apart from medications
5675700 i would add that in any case medication package inserts routinely warn patients about a whole host of issues when starting a course of psychotropic drugs including warning against the handling of machinery driving or engaging in any occupation in which you can be injured so to that extent this concern isnt new
5675701 in adults there has been evidence that less than six hours of sleep a night was associated with high blood pressure levels
5675702 that was one of the more unique findings that poor sleep quality is associated with high blood pressure
5675703 to see how their blood pressure is developing over time
5675704 it does point to the direction that the next studies need to go to understand what less sleep and less efficient sleep mean in terms of blood pressure
5675705 but the changes in the diurnal patterns for adolescents make it harder for them to get up in the morning and to get to sleep at night if we reorganize the day night schedule for adolescents that could make life easier for them and their parents
5675706 we do know that in adults poor sleep and a diminished amount of sleep are associated with obesity and hormone intolerance
5675707 changes occur in the sympathetic nervous system also fragmentary sleep activates inflammatory pathways
5675708 optimizing sleep hygiene following regular sleep habits turning the light off approximately the same time every night keeping the bedroom quieter and avoiding substances that may disturb sleep such as caffeine
5675709 kids as well as adults need to be allowed to sleep enough
5675710 we say eight hours of sleep a night but it takes an hour to wind down its very very hard to allow enough time to sleep
5675711 its done in about 1 5 percent of all procedures in the u s
5675712 bleeding is a major problem the majority of bleeding problems are related to the access site and a bleeding problem is related to long term survival
5675713 traditionally that has been the way our people do it
5675714 there is a steep learning curve you need 100 to 200 cases to feel confident with the technique it takes a couple of years in a practice with a high volume also it is technically more difficult in terms of the whole operation
5675715 it doesnt prolong the period of bed rest they need
5675716 they have equipment for the radial approach but they just dont push it now that this study has been published there might be an incentive to do it
5675717 when used correctly backpacks are the most efficient way to carry a load and distribute the weight among some of the bodys strongest muscles
5675718 our group has been working on understanding heparin biosynthesis for almost 30 years
5675719 we are working on what might be the next generation of heparin production with no animal source
5675720 we treat it to reduce the molecular size then subject it to enzymatic steps to convert it to heparin
5675721 we use recombinant enzymes that are part of the natural pathway for heparin synthesis
5675722 we are now working with one liter amounts there are million liter fermenters we have to scale up three orders of magnitude which is pretty daunting but not impossible
5675723 we have talked to a number of them they all are interested in the approach but want to wait
5675724 but those drugs are a thousand times more expensive than heparin also they are not as good as heparin it has multiple activities many of which benefit patients those drugs are very specific they work well only for a small number of applications
5675725 we believe that the heparin market is here to stay
5675726 at the moment it is not known why hair feels good
5675727 there are several changes that take place at the same time when hair is exposed to hair care products and it will help greatly to understand which of those changes is crucial for optimizing hair care
5675728 if for example it would turn out that there is an optimum friction between single hairs for pleasant touch the molecular composition of hair care products can be optimized to achieve this friction
5675729 those invisible to the eye changes have a great impact on how the ingredients in the products affect the hair
5675730 a lot of this is based on this fundamental understanding of hairs underlying structure and properties
5675731 fundamentally understanding the hair structure is really important in terms of developing products that really deliver
5675732 im not sure i would call it a bias because that word has negative connotations but in general people do seem to have unconscious blind spots when it comes to the elderly
5675733 so not only ems staff but also those receiving patients at trauma centers are operating on subjective assumptions as to what elderly patients need how aggressively they should be treated and what hospitals can do for them rather than on clear and standard protocol codes and trauma recommendations
5675734 and as a result as patients get older they are less likely to get into a trauma center
5675735 so the hope now is to identify this blind spot problem so that we can maybe help ems staff try to catch on and adjust their thinking and attitudes and in turn change their behavior
5675736 i think in general that most providers tend to worry more about the elderly and recognize that they are more at risk and want to get them better care
5675737 and i have to say that ive certainly never seen any evidence of an elderly bias in my practice before here in boston or elsewhere so it makes me wonder if there are other factors at play that the research didnt get at
5675738 for example older people often have complex medical problems and very strong relationships with doctors at a particular center
5675739 so ems providers might perfectly well decide to take an older patient to where they are best known or even respond to a patient request to do so whether or not that center is a trauma center
5675740 highly unlikely that these patient would have been able or have the time to express any preference of care
5675741 and there might be a subset of patients that do better elsewhere
5675742 so in my opinion what the study primarily tells us is that further research is needed
5675743 this imaging modality allows us to see things weve never been able to see before
5675744 we shine light on a nanotube and listen to the ultrasound waves coming out of it
5675745 we will be able to ask a tumor are you responding to chemotherapy or not
5675746 this should give us early information long before the tumor shrinks or grows

5675751 there is no indication that they were drunk or acting in a boisterous manner
5675752 it appears that the male fell through the skylight falling up to 12ft

5675859 when i was inside i did not say a word i did not do anything i am just disappointed when some participants of the forum started hurling rough language at the others with me ngo representatives they reacted but the situation was calmed by the police
5675860 when you talk of sensitivities of others do so behind closed doors and only invite those in authority dont invite any tom dick or harry you can talk about islam but you cannot talk for islam
5675861 i dont call any mamak chendol or kacang putih seller to talk about hinduism do i that would only look stupid i would call the priest the authority and then i can get a better picture on hinduism

5675886 im kind of leaning that way darren mc fadden came out of there and they beat lsu last year
5675887 we pick the best athlete on the team and hes going to play option quarterback for us
5675888 we dont throw the ball very well so we throw the ball by running the option thats how we spread the field
5675889 they asked if i liked the wildcat package and if i would like to run it as the quarterback
5675890 they want me to play cornerback and i dont want to play that
5675891 i wanted to be a dad and wanted to sit in the stands and watch my kids play
5675892 i kind of had a three year business plan to see if it would work
5675893 i always thought the hardest thing for division i coaches was to have the time to evaluate talent practically during the fall
5675894 i thought there was a niche in the market place to outsource the evaluation of prospects its not the superstar on the team that needs to be discovered its that second third or fourth best kid on the team
5675895 the emphasis clearly shifted from the evaluation of seniors during the fall to the evaluation of juniors there was a need for college coaches to find out about juniors no 1 they had to coach the team in the fall no 2 they had to recruit the guys in the current recruiting class no 3 theyre supposed to know who all the other guys are
5675896 it appears they have put more emphasis on texas recruiting
5675897 i hear the high school community talking about them i hear their name a lot more i think theyve been much more aggressive in terms of early offers and they seem to be covering more ground
5675898 when hes in there at quarterback you know youd better get deeper mallett even has been at safety for a few drills to help the other quarterbacks and receivers
5675899 the best thing about ryan is his personality is such hell go do whatever it is you ask him to do
5675900 hes got a great attitude and because of that hell have a good redshirt year mallett 6 6 255 pounds must redshirt this year in accordance with ncaa rules after transferring from michigan and enrolling at arkansas in january
5675901 my role in practice is whatever coach p says for me to do
5675902 this year is going to feel like when i used to go to my dads games and would stand on the sidelines and watch him coach
5675903 i just have to stand there and cheer but its going to be tough to stand there and be a cheerleader as with the other things mallett is called upon to do this year he plans to cheer well too
5675904 hes a competitor and he wants to play but hes handling it real well
5675905 hes out there at practice with a positive attitude and is having fun
5675906 he also knows the other quarterbacks have to get ready for games this season he has to wait his turn and his time is coming harris said hes also been impressed by malletts attitude toward his redshirt year
5675907 hes not eligible to play right now but he hasnt said one negative word about it
5675908 he wanted to be a part of this team and were excited that hes here
5675909 i really like his release and his footwork is better mallett said his goal is to improve in every facet of his game this year
5675910 i think as far as learning the offense and getting bigger faster and stronger redshirting is going to be a great thing for me
5675911 being in the system a full year and developing along with these receivers is going to be a good thing all the way around
5675912 hes doing a good job in the meeting room and learning every day in practice
5675913 once hes able to play im looking forward to seeing him out there competing for the job mcgee said mallett just like every quarterback needs to get a lot of work on fundamentals to stay sharp
5675914 its important for me that during individual periods he gets as many reps as he can
5675915 because thats where hell keep his timing keep his skills and keep his techniques up
5675916 my job is to make sure that hes prepared when he gets to spring ball and really understands the offense and that hes sound as a quarterback
5675917 he doesnt have to throw that 98 mile an hour fastball every time
5675918 hes working on when to take something off the ball and that helps the catchers
5675919 theyre battling theyre doing as much as they can learning on the job smith a 6 0 205 pounder out of abbeville la had been battling a summer hamstring injury through the first two weeks of camp and hadnt made much of an impression before being thrust in with the first team
5675920 working with the ones its faster than working with the threes but im adjusting to it
5675921 im small but im physical enough for it smith said he found out about getting his shot at first team reps monday morning
5675922 i was told to get ready this week and i was like all right theres something on my plate ive got to eat it the details surrounding fortes knee injury and absences from practice and powers hamstring though he has been at practice have been sparse
5675923 hopefully well get elston back toward the end of the week
5675924 i dont know what powers situation is when hell ever be back
5675925 i tell you what i dont mind having battle and smith in there theyre eager theyll hit theyll run theyll try to do everything you coach them to do but they are young so they did make some mistakes at least they were full speed mistakes
5675926 thats unfortunate because we came out of spring very impressed with how he was doing
5675927 hes out here but not able to do a whole lot
5675928 hopefully by the middle to late part of the week hell be running and doing things full speed
5675929 he ran and tackled and played tough and im sure he led us in tackles in the secondary and did a great job
5675930 they had details of explosives and poisons along with information about london landmarks and a computer folder on royal residences we would be foolish to rule out the fact that they may have been planning an attack

5675973 large integrated financial intermediaries ensure that they employ robust consistent pricing policies and procedures incorporating disciplined price verification for both proprietary and counterparty risk trades
5675974 at the other extreme are hedge funds more than 90 of which said they see counterparty risk relative to credit default swaps as posing a significant threat to global markets
5675975 if you are looking for a silver lining in these findings it seems that most institutions think we are currently in the most dangerous period for global financial services firms perhaps if the markets can make it through the next six months the level of pessimism may begin to subside
5675976 the survey results indicate many of the banks widely viewed as being hit hardest by the credit crisis have been the most aggressive when it comes to tightening the margin and collateral requirements imposed on their trading clients but even banks that have emerged relatively unscathed have tightened terms

5676242 for most small service providers it is too expensive to run their own 24 7 data centers using parallels automation we are able to offer integrated exchange 2007 at attractive price points

5676246 what were also seeing is for the people who dont like it generally just dont get it
5676247 and its because weve created something so innovative and different its ironic it just shows that human nature of if you dont understand something you immediately attack it its pretty interesting in that regard
5676248 seed selection is one of the most important investments a corn grower can make
5676249 this program recognizes the reduced annual production risk that comes from using advanced seeds and technologies that have the possibility to increase yields and places that value back in the hands of growers
5676250 a community organization of low and moderate income families that addresses housing schools neighborhood safety health care job conditions and other social issues that affect its members
5676251 we find it abhorrent and do everything we can to prevent it from happening
5676252 as an easy way to get paid by acorn not as an attempt to influence the outcome of elections
5676253 it will do us little good if when the next democrat moves into the white house wall street takes command of our countrys economic policy
5676254 i cant speak french so i let the funky music do the talking
5676255 this latest attack on ultcw once again speaks to the unfortunate extremes uhw w leadership will take to fuel their war waged on seiu its programs and those who support its vision in order to redirect public focus off of their own internal issues surrounding the investigation and legal action taken by its own members for the improper transfer of 3 million of dues money into an outside fund
5676256 as a law firm and leader in the employment and labor arena littler is deeply committed to the nlra and its functions related to employers employees and unions
5676257 unfortunately we feel the efca will do serious harm to the principles of free debate and free choice that are now protected by the nlra
5676258 we do not know why but we want you to be here with this family
5676259 we know that we have other things that we have to do but this is not the day for that
5676260 he was a nice man he was very very friendly
5676261 freehearted person i dont think he ever met a stranger
5676262 hed always come up to me and asked if i needed any help from him
5676263 our thoughts and prayers today go out to jeffs family
5676264 we intend to do everything possible to assist the family of our fallen member the machinists union is a family and today we grieve as a family a
5676265 people across the company are deeply saddened that jeff hart passed away as a result of an accident this morning
5676266 the company offers our most sincere condolences to his family and friends and will be assisting the family during this difficult time
5676267 negotiations broke down friday and they refused to meet with us
5676268 we have the ability to follow the work from one employer to another and they will not agree to it
5676269 will continue to picket until we can resolve our differences
5676270 we were on our way to the doctors office and were waiting to catch the bus and now we basically have to walk down there
5676271 i have a bad knee as well were going to have surgery on it so thats kind of hard for me
5676272 well have the drivers get back to work today if theyre willing to work with us they know what our issues are
5676273 were hoping they can recognize that times are tough our offer is as good as we can make it and i hope they come back to work soon
5676274 there is a shared feeling of disappointment that this has become necessary
5676275 but even as people share their disappointment the vast majority also recognizes the necessity for difficult decisions and hope by addressing these lingering issues head on that we will get to the point where the city will be more stable financially
5676276 theyre the people that mow the grass water the lawns tend the rinks deliver the senior meals the list goes on and on
5676277 they take care of traffic lights plow streets they do whatever theyre told
5676278 why does the city have money to continue to provide services to all of our visitors and tourists but doesnt have the dollars to spend to retain employees who provide services to duluthians
5676279 there can be a lot of posturing on one side or the other
5676280 i can recall situations where the union representative would say this is a real hot button issue for some people wholl be there today so lets both make sure we dont ratchet up the tension level by giving short shrift to it or making offhand comments that can be taken wrong
5676281 if you think everything is fine even though youre paying 3 an hour less than the competition in wages and benefits youre asking to be organized
5676282 theres an old adage out there that bad employees dont bring in unions bad supervisors do
5676283 if the employer is not communicating with employees and assuring them that things are ok during a transition they will look for that support and input from a third party
5676284 played vital roles in facilitating enabling or abetting the employers fraud
5676285 culture of corruption that continues to impede efforts to fight that corruption
5676286 outer and visible signs of organized crime influence have been significantly reduced
5676287 will be able to police itself without court and government supervision
5676288 makes clear that massive job site corruption was taking place from the 1990s through 2006
5676289 it is too early to tell whether recent reforms will achieve the purpose of showing whether the union can police itself without supervision
5676290 the district council must demonstrate that the unions efforts to combat corruption have reduced the frequency and scope of corrupt practices to the extent that this court is convinced that the union and its constituent locals can adequately police themselves without further government involvement and court supervision
5676291 at the present time the district council has not made that showing
5676292 i will make it the law of the land when im president of the united states
5676293 las vegas has been on the radar screen for the labor movement for many years now
5676294 las vegas is the center of unionism in the country everyone is watching because theres a lot of activity going on and all sorts of things happening
5676295 this economic environment is very clearly an opportunity for workers to organize
5676296 if you notice when workers really organize in this country it is during a depression not during good economic times whats going to happen is that all the cuts that companies have done where workers dont have a collective bargaining agreement when the economy gets better and they start rolling around most of the time they dont restore those cuts those cuts become part of the landscape
5676297 sort of de facto abridgement of right to work laws
5676298 you might have a latino construction worker whose sister works in a hotel and he hears about hotel maids who can buy houses
5676299 someones walking away with the money and stealing it the workers not getting it we think we have a pretty good case
5676300 although the promised land will not be reached with barack obama as president he will be much better for unions than john mccain
5676301 libertarians hate the government and love a good fight they are absolutely the best friends you can have

5676306 beim stichwort stadtrennen denkt man in der formel 1 zun chst an monaco doch mit diesem klassiker hat valencia nicht viel gemein au er dass beide st dte am mittelmeer liegen und der kurs am hafen vorbei f hrt
5676307 nicht gerade typisch f r einen stadtkurs also sondern eher so etwas wie silverstone oder monza in der stadt
5676308 wichtig ist mit einem richtig bersetzten auto anzureisen und ein setup im trefferbereich zu haben die piloten sollten das auto auf der bahn halten und so viele daten wie m glich sammeln sich langsam und sukzessive steigern und die boliden wieder heil an die box bringen
5676309 es ist nat rlich ein unterschied ob man horizontale oder vertikale auslaufzonen aus beton hat aber ich erwarte dass der neue kurs alles bietet was die sicherheitsvorkehrungen betrifft es wird keine harakiristrecke sein
5676310 es wird ein echter stadtkurs im sinne von innenstadt in sachen charme und anspruch k nnte das rennen monaco am n chsten kommen
5676311 ich bin in amerika schon viele stadtrennen gefahren und in der saison damals waren alle strecken f r mich neu da musste ich lernen mich schnell anzupassen
5676312 am meisten lernt man aber wenn man selbst f hrt
5676313 es ist immer ein spezielles gef hl vor meinen landsleuten zu fahren

5676321 every time i think about back home its cool and breezy i wish that i could be there right now just passing time
5676322 there remain significant external risks presented by the deterioration in the broader economic outlook and the continuing turbulence in financial markets
5676323 the a amp l board sees no obvious circumstances that are likely materially to improve conditions in the financial markets or the broader economic outlook in the near to medium term
5676324 the a amp l board also recognises the risk that further shocks to the financial system created by unfavourable developments at other financial institutions could generate widespread general adverse sentiment towards financial groups like a amp l
5676325 the a amp l board has concluded therefore that there is a risk of external events further eroding shareholder value and that the value to a amp l shareholders of the greater certainty provided by being part of a larger organisation is considerable
5676326 we know we have to pay the prevailing wage after that we dont get much into it
5676327 ellos tienen que justificar de lo contrario tendr n que devolver la plata
5676328 on the grounds that it only seeks to pay cheaper flexible severance payments in making staff redundant
5676329 in supporting evidence the union says that because the purpose of the scheme is to help reduce the number of civilian staff by at least 5 000 the mod should use the more favourable compulsory severance terms rather than seeking to make job cuts on the cheap
5676330 prospect says the mod scheme breaches the terms of the civil service management code and the civil service compensation scheme
5676331 depends on the policy of georgian president mikheil saakashvili and the action of his forces

5676334 i find the ethical considerations of supervised injections to be profoundly disturbing
5676335 for health care professionals to support the distribution of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed if this were done in a doctors office the provincial college of physicians would rightly be investigating
5676336 the supervised injection site undercuts the ethic of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada who might begin to question whether its all right to allow someone to overdose under their care
5676337 este es un territorio nuevo para m estoy acostumbrado a tener seis semanas de preparaci n con mis equipos antes del primer partido y aqu he tenido tres d as no hay tiempo para experimentos es un nuevo cap tulo de mi vida y estoy algo nervioso quiero hablar personalmente con cada uno de los jugadores

5676365 widespread appearance of dengue in the continental united states is a real possibility
5676366 paradoxically the presence of aedes albopictus may lower the risk of dengue because it may be out competing aedes aegypti
5676367 i said goodbye because i thought i was dying i couldnt even stand up anymore i was like a human larva
5676368 we know it could certainly cause outbreaks in northern climates

5676444 the problem with this slumping housing market right now is that even qualified home buyers are having trouble qualifying for a home loan
5676445 our method empowers sellers by allowing them to sell their home to any qualified buyer
5676446 by offering temporary owner financing we find that most sellers have a contract in place within the first two weeks
5676447 this is because they can reach more buyers have more showings and get more and better offers from buyers that would normally not consider that home due to lack of financing
5676448 whats really great about our program is that we can even help owners who find themselves facing foreclosure
5676449 when youre under that kind of pressure and need to sell quickly temporary owner financing can be a real life saver

5676460 im not going to play with those washington bad boys
5676461 many men who love their partners and have great sex at home never turn down an opportunity for a bit on the side if they think they can get away with it
5676462 i can only confirm the b sample test has come positive but the results of both tests are different which is strange to us
5676463 they took my urine samples at the same time in the ipl and the tests have shown up different results that certainly makes my case stronger
5676464 we will appeal to the ipl drug tribunal and point out the difference in the test results i am hopeful of being cleared even now
5676465 i can assure everyone that i never took any banned substance or drugs to enhance my performance which is why i am still confident of being cleared in this case we will fight it to the end
5676466 if its meant to happen it will i love and adore being a mother
5676467 i understand that raising children is universally difficult and that people read an article hoping for something worthwhile in it the truth is i am not on some inside track i have no incredible revelations to share

5676471 its definitely been an interesting six to eight months since the hellgate launch
5676472 been a lot of things going on since october seems like longer than that i spent a lot of hours in the office sleeping on the floor phone calls all across the world working on stuff
5676473 we announced on july 11 that we had to lay off the vast majority of the employees but theres still a small handful of the founders working on things really our focus now has been on how we best take care of the guys that arent there anymore and help them find jobs with other teams
5676474 obviously weve got people we owe money to so were doing absolutely everything in our power to get those people the money we owe them
5676475 theyre trying to figure out what to do with mythos
5676476 they have it free and clear and theyre looking to start up apparently some u s based studio to do something
5676477 i think that maybe because we tend to think with our hearts a little more than with our heads we probably chased that deal for too long
5676478 we always were under a very firm belief that we would get this together
5676479 in fact when we did eventually have to lay almost everybody off the last paycheck we paid out all came out of the board of directors pockets because we had anticipated having a deal done by that time

5676482 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5676483 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5676484 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5676485 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5676486 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5676487 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5676488 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5676489 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5676490 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5676491 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5676492 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5676493 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5676494 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5676495 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5676496 has to fill the void and the way to do that is establish what their options are
5676497 well i think we are fortunate in scotland we have a number of top class midfield players so thats an area where we have players with similar talents to barry
5676498 ive got selection problems in that position ive got no problem filling that role
5676499 of course you miss barry barry was the captain he was a big inspiration on and off the field
5676500 i think at the beginning of the season it shows how much rangers have missed him but we have other players to come in and i have already said people like darren fletcher top class player playing regular for manchester united and hes got everything you would need for a midfield player

5676508 the fact such huge teams are interested in you fills you with pride but im relaxed and happy to play for sevilla who are a big club
5676509 the team captain will be john terry and the vice captain will be rio ferdinand
5676510 i remember when rio was captain he played very well and it was not easy for me to choose the captain
5676511 i think the big personality was the reason why i chose john the captain is very important because he drives the team
5676512 one of the reasons local citizens depend on our products is that we deal in high quality
5676513 people in basrah and nasariyah in the south or mosul in the north always ask us to provide them with products its a good sign for us that people still want high quality
5676514 we faced a hard situation when the insurgents and militias took over the neighborhoods here
5676515 we faced a lot of problems especially with the power
5676516 we discovered this was something they were lacking and not only would it bring revenue and jobs but it would also help the whole country as well
5676517 we were able to save them quite a bit so were hoping with that money they will be able to get the parts they need
5676518 theyve been running at a loss pretty much since 2003 because of low productivity but theyve been able to come through i think a lot of that money is coming from their other businesses they run or personal money
5676519 ahmed strikes me as a good guy who genuinely cares about his product and is proud of what he does
5676520 he wants people to want to buy his product not because it is one of the only ones available but because its the best
5676521 tomorrow morning there will be a total eclipse of the sun at nine oclock this is something which we cannot see everyday so let the work force line up outside in their best clothes to watch it to mark the occasion of this rare occurrence i will personally explain the phenomenon to them if it is raining we will not be able to see it very well and in that case the work force should assemble in the canteen
5676522 by order of the managing director there will be a total eclipse of the sun at nine o clock tomorrow morning if it is raining we will not be able to see it in our best clothes on the site in this case the disappearance of the sun will be followed through in the canteen this is something we cannot see happening everyday
5676523 by order of the managing director we shall follow the disappearance of the sun in our best clothes in the canteen at nine oclock tomorrow morning the managing director will tell us whether it is going to rain this is something which we cannot see happen everyday
5676524 if it is raining in the canteen tomorrow morning which is something that we cannot see happen everyday the managing director in his best clothes will disappear at nine o clock
5676525 dat zou betekenen dat als je in een groep staat verantwoordelijk bent voor het geweld dat anderen plegen ook als je niets doet

5676532 we blijven druk zien op onze markt en de consument in het algemeen
5676533 de pvda is een bestuurderspartij dus we vinden het belangrijk om in het college te blijven ook al was de cda een moeilijke partij om mee samen te werken in het college we werken liever met hen dan met de vvd die intern verdeeld is
5676534 wir setzen unsere angebote immer phantasievoll um zum beispiel wenn wir den kleinsten tiere ber den r cken laufen lassen prasselnde fingerspitzen sind krabbelnde ameisen wenn die handballen abrollen ist da ein dicker elefant unterwegs und so weiter nebenbei erz hlen wir geschichten oder spielen r tselraten
5676535 normalerweise geht es mit vier jahren los obwohl wir auch schon zweij hrige hatten
5676536 wichtig ist dass ein kind offen ist und die ber hrungen wirklich genie en kann wenn wir merken dass sich ein kind nicht wohlf hlt dann brechen wir sofort ab
5676537 ich bin mutter von drei kindern und sicher nicht unkritisch aber dass eine 15 min tige schoko massage zu seelischen st rungen f hren soll das finde ich wirklich sehr weit hergeholt es geht hier ja nicht um sch nheitsideale und bertriebenen luxus sondern ums wohlf hlen und puren spa nichts weiter
5676538 wir haben sogar schon kleine stammg ste die ihre eigenen termine machen m chten das ist zu niedlich
5676539 we hebben door de jaren heen al veel kunnen verbeteren maar zijn nog niet klaar daarom grijpt de anwb dit feestelijke moment aan om aandacht te vragen voor de verkeersveiligheid van kinderen tussen thuis en school
5676540 we moved out of our old house to save money not to be taxed more
5676541 ive been living here eight years and now the town is changing its mind hello
5676542 my intent really was maintaining the status of existing condo owners
5676543 im sorry i take personal responsibility for giving anguish to so many of my seniors i am one of them i never meant it
5676544 and we are so much stuck that we cannot do anything
5676545 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5676546 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5676547 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5676548 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5676549 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5676550 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5676551 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5676552 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water
5676553 we just cant shut that machine off then you know what we cant shut that machine off
5676554 if theyre infected with west nile where they have west nile fever or they have west nile virus meningitis or encephalitis these data can tell them what to expect that gradually over about a year their mental and physical function generally and on average will return to normal
5676555 i think at least it helps patients and physicians and their families to know what to expect over time
5676556 i had to learn how to start all over again walking you name it
5676557 initially most people felt that it was a relatively mild infection and that people recover from it very quickly
5676558 i think this paper as well as a couple of papers out of the u s in the last couple of years have really hit home the fact that this disease has a tremendous impact on people
5676559 and a year to recovery is a long time and even people with what we thought was the more mild form of the disease are significantly debilitated for a period of time
5676560 whats interesting and what surprised us was the fact that there seems to be a lot of resiliency in individuals who had the encephalitis or meningitis or the milder symptoms
5676561 the hope is so high that it will have some effect that everybodys asking for it
5676562 we dont have any data yet that says taking an otherwise healthy adult whos vitamin d deficient and supplementing them prevents cancer reduces the risk of heart disease
5676563 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5676564 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant
5676565 there is a god shaped vacuum in the heart of every person and it can never be filled by any created thing it can only be filled by god made known through jesus christ
5676566 for the naysayers out there that would say the lights are out the lights are very dim on sco and its only a matter of time until there are no lumens coming out of the light bulbs and the games over thats far from what the truth is
5676567 the truth is the substantial amount of investment weve put into this mobile business in the past four years its in the tens of millions of dollars is now ready to go into harvest mode
5676568 we think itll actually be a killer application in the world of mobile phones
5676569 theyre going to the organizations that rely on franklincovey and will listen to them with an open mind
5676570 they actually have a decent pedigree with regard to their technical skills
5676571 but the problem is they carry so much baggage along with their corporate name that getting somebody to take a meeting so they can pitch the product is incredibly difficult im not convinced they can ramp the volume
5676572 itll be a lot more valuable out from beneath the sco brand
5676573 we really have a lot of confidence in it its very fast its easy to use youre always connected in real time its talking to a server and its always being updated
5676574 as we move forward at some point well have to answer that question what i can say is im very committed to sco stakeholders to finish off this battle that we started five years ago we believe it is time now to go in and get things finished off
5676575 the non economic consequences of immigration to california and by extension to the rest of the united states
5676576 will latin american migrants bring with them the tradition of the mordida bribe the lack of involvement in public affairs etc
5676577 will blacks be able to improve or even maintain their position in the face of the latin onslaught
5676578 we shouldnt let people like john tanton and his hate mongers come into tennessee and dictate how were going to treat people
5676579 he didnt want everybody to know he was taking money from these hate groups
5676580 i dont see any other brand being able to build that kind of market in refurbished products
5676581 apple is the only brand i see being able to pull off something like that i dont see any other brand being able to have that kind of following for refurbished products
5676582 generally here in the u s the ipod cool factor is something that continues to drive apples success whether its with a next generation iphone or ipod touch
5676583 its such a phenomenon that everyone seems to be wondering whats coming next
5676584 weve been offering repair services for ipods since march since the beginning we started buying broken ones well service them in a large batch well take and sell those refurbs on some other site
5676585 one of the biggest changes was at amp t was officially subsidizing the phone and they wouldnt let you buy them without a contract
5676586 anyone who wants an iphone has to go through at amp t and all the hassle and contracts and all that
5676587 some would go to consumer to consumer sites like ebay
5676588 we decided to facilitate that secondary market and offer both buyers and sellers an option of where they can get their iphones bought and sold
5676589 right now were in the stage where were just trying to buy a lot of them
5676590 we actually have an official iphone buyback program for fully functional first generation iphones
5676591 weve had a ton of response a lot of people submitting information
5676592 basically they just go to the web site hit the iphone buyback link fill in the information and when they submit it well e mail them a shipping label for them to send it to us you just pack it up safely and ship it to us well verify everything and write them a check
5676593 if youe looking to upgrade to the new iphone and you already have a contract with at amp t that covers most of that
5676594 its really easy and youre working with a reliable vendor
5676595 although its only 200 for a new iphone in the store theres a hidden subsidy youve got 40 a month for the basic phone service and 30 for web connection and 5 a month for 200 text messages
5676596 by the time you have taxes and fees its probably 85 a month for 450 minutes most people are probably spending 100 for more so even though the phone itself is technically cheap there are a lot of hidden costs there
5676597 theres always more problems in selling used computer equipment it doesnt move as fast its not as portable even with the laptops
5676598 most people are going to want to keep a laptop for at least two years after that its not a lot of use to somebody else the main function of the ipod on the other hand is that it plays music laptops built in 2001 would no longer run the kinds of applications needed to run today
5676599 i think people are more likely to keep the device with computers through its useful life until its core functionality is reduced
5676600 theres always going to be a market for a hot product used or otherwise
5676601 oh that is just boys being boys that stuff always happens
5676602 new clean technologies are being developed around the world which can reduce the environmental impact of coal fired generation
5676603 powerfuels new development at hatfield in yorkshire is an example of how a new clean coal plant can be developed in practice
5676604 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5676605 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5676606 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5676607 if microsoft is so good at testing why does your software suck
5676608 we are not going to be able to make up through wind farms all the deficit on nuclear power
5676609 we cant become a low carbon economy in a single step
5676610 this consultation is a total farce ministers have clearly already decided to back nuclear
5676611 if we want to have secure energy supplies and reduce co2 emissions we have got to put the issue of nuclear power on the agenda
5676612 disregard the issue of risk and cost and toxic waste
5676613 the fear we have is that by investing in nuclear we will invest in a dangerous dirty white elephant
5676614 by prioritising the construction of new nuclear power stations over reducing demand for energy the government is not only missing a trick it is undermining efforts to tackle climate change
5676615 whatever the rhetoric there is nothing in this white paper that will guarantee that a single nuclear power station will be built
5676616 business will only invest in nuclear power if it knows its costs it needs certainty about carbon decommissioning and waste
5676617 given a fair wind it could be ready by 2017
5676618 i put it as the difference between the concorde and the boeing 747
5676619 the 747 is an economic plane and we will build an economic plant we do not require government subsidy
5676620 the epr is very expensive and all the problems with waste have yet to be solved
5676621 we are waiting for the government white paper on the future of energy generation to find out what role nuclear generation is to play
5676622 but we believe nuclear power is needed as part of the solution to ensuring security of energy supply and because it is virtually carbon dioxide emission free it does not add to climate change
5676623 i think one of the environmental issues that has not yet been properly addressed is the balance to be struck between the impact on say the river severn and the environmental gain that would come from not putting more and more carbon into the atmosphere
5676624 they have always been looking for ways to produce energy
5676625 with recent issues such as renewable energy and commitment to the kyoto protocol it is much more of a concern
5676626 with the huge threat of climate change it is only through clean green alternatives from household solar panels to large scale schemes such as the severn barrage that we can make the necessary reductions in our carbon emissions
5676627 im not saying it will be built but the case for further studies is a strong one i think we will see a major reappraisal of this project
5676628 prices of fossil fuels have gone up the environment has changed legislation has changed the way we sell electricity has changed and the security of supply is a bigger issue
5676629 this project is successful because portugals sunshine is plentiful the solar power technology is proven and government policies are supportive
5676630 will be a cost effective scheme that will save over a million tonnes of carbon per year by 2020
5676631 there is a lot coal still available to me mined
5676632 hey look out for that guy i just read the fan club and i bet he kidnaps and rapes women
5676633 texans should have the opportunity to do their part to help these officers in their time of need
5676634 i saw that we have one dog and they have four we have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and they have a creek that has no end we have imported lanterns in our garden and they have the stars at night our patio reaches to the front yard and they have the whole horizon we have a small piece of land to live on and they have fields that go beyond our sight we have servants who serve us but they serve others we buy our food but they grow theirs we have walls around our property to protect us and they have friends to protect them
5676635 if we didnt have detective sotos own words motive would have been open to speculation
5676636 if we dont replace the existing nuclear power stations then first i can not see how we are going to meet our climate change targets
5676637 and secondly we will end up as we move as a country from self sufficiency in gas to importing large amounts of foreign gas we are going to be dependent on very uncertain supplies of energy and that would be bad for business and bad for the consumer
5676638 the governments so called consultation was a sham and we are very pleased the judge has agreed with us on that
5676639 if tony blair wants to continue with his misguided plan for a whole new generation of nuclear power stations the government will have to go back to the drawing board
5676640 the fullest possibly public consultation and the publication of a further white paper setting out our proposals
5676641 new nuclear power stations would make a significant contribution to meeting our energy policy goals
5676642 there could be no proper consultation let alone the fullest consultation if the substance of these two issues was not consulted on before a decision was made
5676643 what it really says is that the government has been shown up as fundamentally deceitful
5676644 the judgement really shows you cant perform a 180 degree u turn on a matter as important as nuclear power without a proper public debate
5676645 its a real slap in the face for prime ministers sofa style of government
5676646 todays historic result shows that the government have got a fight on their hands
5676647 the energy review was clearly just a rubber stamping exercise for a decision the prime minister had already taken
5676648 ear nose and throat health problems are among the most common medical conditions that children face
5676649 so in addition to the standard back to school physical parents should also consider whether or not their child would also benefit from seeing an otolaryngologist for additional evaluation
5676650 other common issues like chronic allergies and sinusitis can also make a big impact on back to school success knowing the signs and symptoms will help a parent take quick action should an ent health issue arise
5676651 our fears regarding these medi cal provider cuts are coming true
5676652 pharmacists have been forced to make the incredibly difficult decisions to turn away patients this has been a real struggle for pharmacists as they have served many of these patients for years and have become like family however some pharmacists have no choice as long as the state reimburses them at 10 20 or 50 or more below actual cost of the drug its not rocket science you cant stay in business if you are losing money on nearly every transaction its a sad situation one that can hopefully be remedied by the courts or through an alternative solution by the legislature
5676653 pharmacists have been encouraged by the support we have received from patients across the state
5676654 if you listed all the petition signatures end to end it would stretch ten miles
5676655 the real tragedy is that many of these patients cannot go for even one day without their medication
5676656 especially those with hiv mental illness or cancer any disruption in care can have long term adverse complications and will result in patients turning to emergency rooms for care or worse which will cost the state far more money than the projected savings from these medi cal cuts

5676873 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama

5676889 there are public fields behind the church where they gather to take turns hitting the balls its a very high roof and i think that is what attracts them
5676890 im obviously upset and i hope that they dont realise the damage they are doing it would be much worse if they were aware of it that would make it even more unacceptable
5676891 the church is a vital part of the village and the hall is used by everyone from youth groups to old folks dinners its a slap in the face for the community who deserve better

5676920 the bank records seized demonstrate that the world tamil movement has developed an elaborate machine like entity that moves throughout the greater toronto area collecting funds with extreme proficiency
5676921 congruent with the money laundering techniques often employed by organized crime groups
5676922 i also believe that the number of accounts alone demonstrate that the world tamil movement has utilized the canadian banking system to raise funds in a manner that is best suited to financing the terrorist activities of the ltte
5676923 it is obvious from the amounts collected with this method that the pre authorized payment scheme is effective timely and spares valued resources
5676924 upon their return to canada these persons were visited by representatives of the world tamil movement to exact the collection of the monthly stipend

5676964 it was going to take months but he was really keen to announce it he will be giving them the letter its quite amazing he will be there to do it
5676965 believe what she sees and hears its just the way it is portrayed
5676966 there have been all these stories saying he has cheated on me and in my heart i dont want to believe it
5676967 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
5676968 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5676969 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5676970 theres a lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger theres a lot of women voicing their opinions
5676971 now beauty is in the eye of the beholder beauty can be a good set of teeth beauty is nice wavy hair beauty can be blue eyes or green eyes there is such a thing as disposition temperament manners general attractiveness attitude and demeanour all those things tend to make a person attractive
5676972 returning us to the dark ages and making the guys that live in this town seem like sex hungry men that will pounce upon the first girl that they see walking down the street
5676973 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting
5676974 anyone who moves to mount isa beautiful or not so beautiful they have a great chance to make a great life here it is a fantastic town
5676975 if guys have the right attitude then you know any type of girl will be happy to be with them so maybe the guys need to fix their attitudes a little bit
5676976 hello my baby hello my darlin hello my ragtime gaaaaaaal
5676977 its incredibly dark you still get the gist of it the only difference between r rated and pg 13 is you might not see as much blood you might not see blood squirting everywhere but as far as the sadness and the darkness of it and the distraught nature of these human beings is very much captured in the film
5676978 its probably one of the edgier roles ive played but also the most layered heres a very happy guy who worked a dismal job had a beautiful family but the beauty in his life was taken away he just goes on a rampage its all driven by emotion
5676979 we dont have a simulator like other teams do but we have some on paper so i can see speeds braking and gears things like that so we can look at the profile
5676980 i will try and get some footage and ive already seen something on the internet
5676981 i dont walk all the circuits any more but on the new ones i will walk and try to do it with a scooter or a car
5676982 it helps a bit i think walking the circuit driving it and watching the footage is better than a simulator as it gives you a rough idea
5676983 weve got a few things we do simulators are a way to get your head around the track and then you calibrate all that into what we do
5676984 if those numbers are right then an advantage of 25 horsepower with the same air resistance brings a benefit of four tenths per lap
5676985 i dont know if it is the breakthrough but im certainly happy to have scored points in hungary
5676986 it was important for the team and for me and overall it was a very positive weekend
5676987 i would like to have another solid weekend in valencia starting off with a good day of practice on friday qualifying in the top ten and showing good race pace to hopefully finish in the points thats how i will approach this race after the summer break i am well rested and motivated to have a great end to the season
5676988 this season i have already learned several new circuits but the difference this time is that all the drivers will be in the same position and having to learn the circuit
5676989 i think that from the point of view of the championship its interesting to visit new tracks its an extra challenge for the drivers as well as the teams
5676990 im very happy to be driving at home for a second time its always a special feeling to race in front of my countrymen and im really looking forward to it
5676991 in barcelona we were having a strong race when i had to retire but i hope this time i can get a good result as the circuit will be new for all the drivers
5676992 we were on the pace in hungary the car felt good and we showed we are still moving forward and that we will fight hard to finish in fourth place in the championship
5676993 i like street circuits they are always an interesting challenge and the sensation of speed from inside the cockpit is incredible
5676994 i will do my best to improve the set up of the car over the weekend so that we can aim for a strong result whatever happens i will give my maximum for this second grand prix in spain
5676995 i would like to have another solid weekend starting off with a good day of practice on friday qualifying in the top ten and showing good race pace to hopefully finish in the points thats how i will approach this race
5676996 im still smiling after hungary that was an incredible result and a fantastic feeling i hope it will be the first of many podiums in formula 1
5676997 the important thing was that we showed just how competitive we are at the moment and moved further ahead in fourth place in the constructors championship
5676998 there is a great atmosphere in the team and we are all working hard together to move forward which is why it was so satisfying to get on the podium in hungary
5676999 valencia is a new race and we must start again
5677000 i did plenty of street races when i was racing in champ cars and in that season almost all the tracks were new to me so i have learnt to adapt quickly
5677001 it looks like an interesting circuit and its quite long so it should be a good show
5677002 we saw that bmw had a poor weekend and toyota had a good weekend but i dont believe the pecking order suddenly changes
5677003 there are certainly trends and at the moment we have a very distinct upward trend whereas bmw have a little bit of a downward trend and toyota seem to fluctuate
5677004 so i dont think that the race itself shows a change to the status quo but merely reinforces the trends which have been developing for a little while
5677005 the performance in hungary reinforces the belief that we are moving in the right direction and gives me confidence that we can finish fourth in the championship and end the season with the third fastest car
5677006 we look forward to every race and i think we like the challenge of a new circuit
5677007 definitely they will come back strongly they have a very good side and they have a lot of talented individual players who can change the match for them
5677008 the only option right now is to play more and more of him and thats the only way of getting better you can see a thousand videos but it doesnt matter until you go out there and play him off the track from 20 yards

5677012 een akkoord is zich aan het aftekenen rond een verharding van de toon ten opzichte van rusland
5677013 het aantal verkeersdoden moet verder naar omlaag maar we verwachten van de staatssecretaris een grondig en globaal voorstel in plaats van enkele losse ideetjes die op geen enkele manier zijn doorgepraat binnen de regering
5677014 onlangs bleek dat het bivv in feite het reeds lang aangekondigde bart project belgian accident research team nog moet opstarten het is droevig vast te stellen dat er zoveel uitspraken gebeuren over verkeersveiligheid terwijl het in ons land nog mangelt aan degelijk onderzoek naar ongevallenomstandigheden

5677022 now beauty is in the eye of the beholder beauty can be a good set of teeth beauty is nice wavy hair beauty can be blue eyes or green eyes
5677023 there is such a thing as disposition temperament manners general attractiveness attitude and demeanour all those things tend to make a person attractive
5677024 returning us to the dark ages and making the guys that live in this town seem like sex hungry starved men that will pounce upon the first girl that they see walking down the street
5677025 the people that are coming into town now are coming here to work and find a house and live and bring up their families but with these sort of comments id say humph fancy going up to that place
5677026 anyone who moves to mount isa beautiful or not so beautiful they have a great chance to make a great life here it is a fantastic town
5677027 we date who a person appears to be but we marry who they are
5677028 people dont think about whether the person they are dating has the tenacity to withstand losing the house or a child getting cancer
5677029 you can end up in bed with a stranger even though you have rings that match
5677030 if you are careful about who you invest time in and do the background work a lot of relationship mistakes can be avoided
5677031 the best you can hope for is that someone is 80 percent of what youre looking for oh snap t d jakes knows bout 80 20 hahah
5677032 you can find pretty close or almost but youre not going to find mr right
5677033 events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5677034 you have to convince your government to put an end to the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5677035 i dont know that it is any more threatening than what is already present in afghanistan
5677036 this threat would seem to indicate they have more capability than realistically they do
5677037 sometimes people think synonymously disaster conflicts whats the difference but there are some very clear and distinct differences when your security daily is at risk or being threatened by these organized groups whose mission to cause terror
5677038 im really excited to be working on it and its in the really early stages we just signed it the other day
5677039 i have such an enormous admiration for its creators that our first and foremost concern is going to be a real degree of faithfulness to the tone of the movie to the mix of genres and so on and so forth

5677054 the holy grail of enzyme catalysis and the ultimate manifestation of understanding of this process is the ability to design enzymes
5677055 what really fits is the electrostatic interaction between the enzyme active site to the substrate charges at the so called transition state where the bonds are halfway to being broken
5677056 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5677057 we all want to know whats going to happen if you transplant these stem cells into a person
5677058 the data is quite convincing based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
5677059 thats the beauty of this kind of noninvasive imaging system it allows us to assess the response of one animal to a variety of conditions and gives us much more valuable information
5677060 a lot of research efforts are devoted to the basic science of stem cells this work is focused on the immediate practicalities of actually using these cells therapeutically

5677062 having a balanced diet is so important for a healthy lifestyle
5677063 if children havent eaten and go to school then their energy levels will be low and it can affect their concentration and learning
5677064 if you eat toast then it should be on wholemeal balanced breakfasts include wholemeal cereal with milk yogurt and glass of orange juice scrambled eggs on brown bread and baked beans are really good for you
5677065 people should eat a low fat breakfast a couple of pieces of fruit and a bowl of scottish porridge it is a much better start to the day than some sad looking thing that is cold dried up and out of a packet

5677069 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5677070 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
5677071 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
5677072 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5677073 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
5677074 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
5677075 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
5677076 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
5677077 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
5677078 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
5677079 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
5677080 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
5677081 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
5677082 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
5677083 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
5677084 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
5677085 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
5677086 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
5677087 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
5677088 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
5677089 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family

5677099 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
5677100 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
5677101 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
5677102 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
5677103 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
5677104 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
5677105 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
5677106 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
5677107 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5677108 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
5677109 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
5677110 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
5677111 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
5677112 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
5677113 evidemment je ne suis pas daccord car cette mesure est une mesure qui une fois de plus ne r gle rien long terme
5677114 on va essayer de ne pas r percuter cette mesure dans nos tarifs cette ann e

5677129 we dont want to have our problem out there we dont want to just shift the problem from here to there thats not how we think we think of the planet
5677130 it will keep the rock tenn plant open and save hundreds of good jobs and it will provide an energy source thats really clean that everyone in the community can support i believe
5677131 your chorus was the best out of of all we heard this year
5677132 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5677133 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5677134 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5677135 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5677136 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5677137 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention
5677138 this is gonna be a fucking killer show and definitely the best uk festival for 2008 the line up is truly awesome boasting the premier most extreme metal bands from all genres this country uk has had to offer over the past 25 years hats off to the promoters for getting this one together this could well be our last uk appearance before we wind up the killing peace promotion so hope to see you all there for what i guarantee will be one insane fucking day
5677139 everything must come to and end now it is clear we will have the last show in 2008 in london england at the famous astoria

5677156 i said to him robbed this time of the night i would like to meet such people
5677157 i wanted to kick him in the chest but i actually got him in the face
5677158 accused three hassen had told me outside the house the people were prepared to get a beating and this is what i did
5677159 i said i did not mean to kick you so hard i will wipe it off
5677160 when are you going to finish with him when are you going to shoot him
5677161 at that moment the deceased said to me i have children dont kill me i told him going to be killed thats not how i understand the thing
5677162 i said i did not come here to kill people f k the job
5677163 i said what the f k was that waheed and he told me to drive
5677164 i threw the paper in front of him and said waheed what s t have you landed me in he just looked at me and said its not me jeff he did not say anything more he just sat there like a zombie

5677172 we determine what is going to be better for us it is good people who make the neighborhood
5677173 it is the quickest way to get this mess cleared up
5677174 you need people to buy the property and fix it up and move back its the way the market works its wonders
5677175 more people are buying than i had noticed thats a good thing
5677176 if they fix it and maintain it and contribute to the quality of life of the neighborhood that is fine
5677177 we need more investment in the neighborhood and it is important it happen fast hopefully this is a sign we are now at the bottom and people are starting to buy
5677178 savvy real estate investors have money and now it is a great opportunity for them to buy
5677179 this is what ive been working for all my life and its mine
5677180 these guys should get awards for what they are doing
5677181 the house is going to be nice and neat and beautiful
5677182 well i think we are fortunate in scotland we have a number of top class midfield players so thats an area where we have players with similar talents to barry
5677183 ive got selection problems in that position ive got no problem filling that role
5677184 of course you miss barry barry was the captain he was a big inspiration on and off the field
5677185 i think at the beginning of the season it shows how much rangers have missed him but we have other players to come in and i have already said people like darren fletcher top class player playing regular for manchester united and hes got everything you would need for a midfield player
5677186 im going to discuss it with the owners as to whether we take our chance on the ground
5677187 weve got the horse ready hes 110 you wouldnt have him any better
5677188 the team captain will be john terry and the vice captain will be rio ferdinand
5677189 i remember when rio was captain he played very well and it was not easy for me to choose the captain
5677190 i think the big personality was the reason why i chose john the captain is very important because he drives the team
5677191 i have not heard a dickie bird from middlesbrough they have gone nowhere near him
5677192 in football there are times when things dont go well
5677193 sometimes you hold your hands up and say youve been outfought or that the opposition did something tactically that we couldnt cope with or that they were technically better but i dont think it was down to any of that
5677194 i just dont think we had any players who were at it but ive got to be thinking that it was a bit of a freak
5677195 burn after reading is on the final list of titles released today by the toronto international film festival

5677229 we wanted to produce a large number of disease models for ourselves our collaborators and the stem cell research community to accelerate research
5677230 the original embryonic stem cell lines are generic and allow you to ask only basic questions but these new lines are valuable tools for attacking the root causes of disease our work is just the beginning for studying thousands of diseases in a petri dish
5677231 in six months than he had in years toiling over embryonic stem cells
5677232 the largest source of funding for embryonic and pluripotent stem cell research in the world
5677233 it appears that the cirm s love affair with slow inefficient expensive ethically fraught and legally complex human embryonic stem cells may be drawing to a close
5677234 it may not yet be a full fledged exodus but it would appear that the tide has changed dramatically
5677235 if this continues and it becomes clear that the tide is irreversibly flowing toward ipsc s the political ability to create an international ban on human cloning with the catcalls of cures to distract leaders from doing the right thing will increase we may actually be able to throttle human cloning before it gets too far out of the test tube
5677236 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
5677237 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
5677238 the apa report in fact does draw a very strong and dogmatic conclusion that cannot be defended on the basis of evidence since this evidence is lacking by the admission of the report
5677239 what the committee has in effect said is that until there is compelling evidence to the contrary people should act as though abortion has no harmful effects this is not a defensible position in a situation in which there is evidence pointing in the direction of harmful effects
5677240 no doctor would ever tell a woman that abortion was one of the choices she should rely on for contraception

5677247 oh my god see there was a problem the first time they did the hair that first press release i dont know there was some confusion over how to do it
5677248 we have a lot of producers and we have a lot of input coming from all different directions and so they decided to straighten my hair
5677249 my hairs naturally curly its also naturally brown so they dyed my hair for the part they tried straightening it and it came out looking awful
5677250 i got to keep my natural hair which is curly but usually kind of hangs down and they wanted to see my face so they pushed it up and out so basically that early look was not my decision at all its just the way things played out

5677262 free radicals from tobacco smoke have long been suspected of having extremely harmful effects on the body
5677263 based on our work we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions
5677264 this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5677265 all has to show a stance of support to them

5677270 when we found the contamination it was another sign that the way we currently manufacture heparin is simply unsafe unlike the current heparin that is harvested from possibly disease carrying animals in often very poor conditions our fully synthetic heparin will be created in a pharmaceutical manufacturing environment from fermentation to packaging this will give drug manufacturers extreme control over the safety and purity of the product

5677284 the system will allow scientists to explore how different hair care products affect hair to hair interactions so that these products can be optimised in a more systematic fashion

5677301 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviours among asian americans
5677302 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
5677303 the problem in applying stereotype threat to uk medical students is that the majority of ethnic minority medical students here are from south asian backgrounds and it is not fully clear whether negative stereotypes exist about that group
5677304 the aim of the study was to establish if negative stereotypes about that group do exist and thus if stereotype threat might be one reason that uk ethnic minority medical students are underperforming academically
5677305 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities
5677306 however it appears that mood is correlated with cognitive performance more so than medication use

5677313 although ive seen them in action before and had helped to demo a unit
5677314 installing the screen was an easy process the only tricky part was assembling the structure and integrating the screen into it
5677315 mike hardip sanun sales manager for lighthouses sesa office was extremely helpful all the way through the process and the service from both him and his team was very good
5677316 it is our aim at lighthouse to ensure that our customers experience is a good one right from the very start
5677317 it is good to know that mr ahmads faith in specifying lighthouse screen has been justified and were looking forward to a long and happy relationship with both jua wangsa and danascreen

5677322 as soon as i came to flagstaff i felt at home in a way i hadnt felt probably anyplace else ive ever lived
5677323 its the people its the arts its the free exchange of ideas the natural surroundings
5677324 right now my drivers license has my flagstaff address and im registered to vote in flagstaff i care more about flagstaff
5677325 it sounds terrible because ive had a home in the valley for 16 years now
5677326 like many of us they would say boy when i can i would really like to live in one of these beautiful scenic areas
5677327 and as they get close to retirement they can fulfill those wishes
5677328 you get the wave of the baby boom which is bigger than the wave before it and on top of that the baby boomers are more likely to purchase these second homes or amenity homes or move to these areas
5677329 people come to the nice little mountain town so pretty soon guess what they want to live here or at least have a part time home
5677330 start to change it into the place where they came from another park or some walking trails near their home or god forbid a starbucks
5677331 they certainly push the housing market up and the people who want to live here and stay here full time cant afford the houses
5677332 so either they struggle or theyre forced to move somewhere else
5677333 one income families here city officials might as well put up a sign that says stay away
5677334 because unless you come with wealth its hard to make it here
5677335 i was surprised that even once you found it you werent getting paid enough to stay in flagstaff
5677336 people would give their eyeteeth to stay in flagstaff and they are giving their eyeteeth to stay in flagstaff
5677337 and one of the things that struck us was in los angeles in the big metropolitan areas youre kind of anonymous
5677338 and here youre walking down the street and people are saying hi to us and nodding and making eye contact
5677339 and you know it was a little uncomfortable at first because were not used to this
5677340 so here we are and my husband is still working in california and commutes back and forth

5677360 i used to worry about what types of web sites my children would be going to when i was not around be it accidental or by choice
5677361 during the school year i cant deny them the resource of online research and livia web protection gives me assurance that my kids eyes will be shielded from the bad stuff online plus i dont have to worry about security threats like spyware or phishing attacks either livia protects my pc from those dangers also
5677362 for children the internet is a priceless knowledge resource for academic research during the school year
5677363 the flexibility and accuracy of web site categorization within livia allows families and their children to embrace the power of the internet while eliminating access to adult pornographic and potentially hazardous web sites infected with viruses and malicious code
5677364 from a cost perspective it was just hard to top the versatility and strength of the entrust identityguard authentication solution but the usability for our staff members really put the entrust solution over the top
5677365 we now are able to save money across the board and deploy strong enterprise authentication for a larger group of users and the employees can just carry the grid cards with their id badges which makes them much easier to keep track of than a key fob token in addition the platform supports a wide array of authenticators that in the future can help us secure a variety of applications that also house sensitive patient information
5677366 the importance of protecting sensitive patient information is obvious but gwinnett medical center should be applauded for implementing an easier more cost effective authentication platform to assist in their compliance with regulatory requirements
5677367 not only are they solving this current pain point and reducing cost theyre implementing a comprehensive versatile authentication platform with capabilities to help address a variety of security challenges that they may experience in the future
5677368 small healthcare providers understand the need to comply with hipaa but have always struggled with costs and the process to meet regulatory requirements on an ongoing basis the complianceall tm program provides a low fixed price solution to enable organizations to address critical hipaa requirements on a continual basis hopefully this can be a standard hipaa solution available through affiliated it organizations who have a countrywide presence and that can help service the small business sector meet continuous compliance nationally
5677369 there are a few million small healthcare providers and most of them have not expended the effort to comply with hipaa especially the security rule this can become a national problem because when you add them all up they add up to be a significant sector of the healthcare industry making ephi at risk in a huge and incomprehensible sense
5677370 the results of palisades 5 day secure assessments continue to underscore the urgent need for data loss prevention solutions for organizations needing to secure their customer assets and their own data assets
5677371 although high profile data breaches are constantly being exposed in the news sometimes it takes cold hard facts such as the violations uncovered by our 5 day secure assessment program to hit companies closer to home and make them realize that they could be the next tjx or card systems

5677386 theres a lack of well paying jobs in the area

5677389 the only way to make money is selling dope on the corner
5677390 it gives a really powerful message that if youre not in school were going to your home
5677391 most of the time we find dropouts not working and not happy with life
5677392 i would choose john terry 100 i always have and i always will i went on record before the last world cup that i thought he should have got it then
5677393 he would have been my captain then and nothing has changed since for me he is a great leader a great man and a great footballer
5677394 i have nothing against stevie gerrard who i had the pleasure of playing with on his debut or rio
5677395 he has been fighting and fighting until the last moment
5677396 may not fully recover for a long time but weve seen the worst
5677397 some eck officers have done some calculations and there are a number of constituencies where the figures differ
5677398 i do not want to commit myself since i did not make this document but i myself have no objection to putting it into evidence
5677399 we want to see it and we are entitled to see it
5677400 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5677401 cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states
5677402 if the recapitalisation talk is realised there are no assurances that the securities that have been issued by u s mortgage firms will be 100 per cent guaranteed
5677403 mutagenic effects carcinogenic effects sensitization cardiovascular and pulmonary toxicity neurotoxicity as well as possible human fatalities there is a risk in using this product on a large and varied population
5677404 i think we have to do something about the manner in which appointments are done
5677405 the commission should be established in a way that makes it credible
5677406 you must involve others who can play a role in the appointment of commissioners
5677407 if you do that you are likely to create a basis of respect and trust
5677408 i would like to see the eck having its own credibility on the basis of how it is formed and what it does
5677409 integrity is so important for this job to me it is important that they should be of impeccable integrity
5677410 it is no good to appoint people when there is not enough time for them to prepare for the election
5677411 the general election is not something you just wake up and start doing
5677412 we want to make our registers as accurate as possible
5677413 the commission wants to remove dead voters from the current registers and it is only by starting the process afresh that we shall realise this
5677414 were really not based on what they are telling us
5677415 we cant say what that storm is going to do over the next 12 hours
5677416 but we do expect a lot of rain regardless and typically when you have a lot of rain and wind you always expect a few branches to come down and take power lines with them
5677417 uno quiere minutos quiere jugar disfrutar y nadie le puede quitar ese deseo pero no s lo estoy para aportar nivel futbol stico sino tambi n mi experiencia me veo llevando parte de esa responsabilidad en la plantilla ayudando a los jugadores que acaban de llegar aportando otras cosas al club

5677426 violence has had a large impact on border trade because it affects our perceptions of public safety
5677427 we have to be careful that we give people an accurate understanding based on facts not scare stories
5677428 that is why one of our biggest challenges now is to restore a sense of balance between trade and security
5677429 the money from trade generates taxes which pays for homeland security
5677430 we have to continue to coordinate as partners to examine the comprehensive cross border system along both our borders with canada and mexico matching resources with needs and ensuring that in providing for the security of our homeland we also protect our ability to conduct legitimate cross border economic activity that is a critical component to our national economic health
5677431 there remain significant external risks presented by the deterioration in the broader economic outlook and the continuing turbulence in financial markets
5677432 the a amp l board sees no obvious circumstances that are likely materially to improve conditions in the financial markets or the broader economic outlook in the near to medium term
5677433 the a amp l board also recognises the risk that further shocks to the financial system created by unfavourable developments at other financial institutions could generate widespread general adverse sentiment towards financial groups like a amp l
5677434 the a amp l board has concluded therefore that there is a risk of external events further eroding shareholder value and that the value to a amp l shareholders of the greater certainty provided by being part of a larger organisation is considerable
5677435 weve found thats an effective way to get the message out

5677438 sending international observers is a crucial step in stabilising the situation
5677439 i might be naive but im still hopeful that a very strong common effort by europe and the united states will be effective in the withdrawing of russian troops from territory of georgia
5677440 food prices have gone haywire recently but i just do this for the enjoyment ive always loved gardening
5677441 it does save you money but you cant beat eating fresh veg thats just come out of the soil leeks and baby carrots
5677442 i spend around two hours here every day when its raining heavily
5677443 i live just across the road at lingmoor way but its mainly weekends for most people
5677444 its an escape for people but for me its a real pleasure to sit down to a meal and know that the meats the only thing on the plate i didnt grow
5677445 the police told me that people put things there at their own risk but i cant stop putting things on my sons grave
5677446 i go to the cemetery regularly about four days a week
5677447 i was there on monday and it was fine and when i went on wednesday they werent there
5677448 it had me in tears when i went up there
5677449 its disgusting to think people would take things from a babys grave
5677450 that time it wasnt just hassans grave it was others too but this time its just hassans
5677451 these people are desecrating the memory of a loved family member
5677452 this callous action is distressing for families visiting their loved ones graves
5677453 visiting a cemetery plot is a way of coping with loss and a babys death is particularly distressing
5677454 this kind of action shows a level of cruelty which most people cant begin to understand
5677455 we do advise against placing items such as toys or other sentimental objects next to graves as they are at risk of being stolen or weather damaged
5677456 however we have been liaising with the police and will provide as much support as we can
5677457 dumfries pride was an event for the whole community celebrating dumfries and galloways rich diversity

5677459 andrea aprovecha que tienes a una estrella a tu lado
5677460 he gave him a right hook on the jaw which staggered him and he did not retaliate
5677461 mr ratcliffe had something about him and he behaved with great courage and fortitude in a very difficult situation
5677462 it was our daughter shelley who is 24 who took the call and at first we couldnt grasp what was going on we could see that she was upset then i spoke on the phone to david and he told me xenon had been stabbed
5677463 he said he was ok and they had called an ambulance david was trying to reassure me and seemed calm
5677464 david tried to reassure us telling us he was alright but we just jumped straight in our car and went to the cumberland infirmary
5677465 we were waiting for the ambulance then it arrived and though xenon was talking to us and even trying to joke he looked quite bad
5677466 wed been expecting a single stab wound but when we looked at him we realised hed got wounds to the side of his face the bridge of his nose his neck his back
5677467 we think there were about 14 wounds in all wed not expected that
5677468 one stab wound punctured the wall of his stomach and punctured his liver that was the worst wound and thats why they kept him in
5677469 on friday night the surgeon was telling xenon that he had no idea how lucky he had been he could easily have been killed or lost an eye
5677470 we just felt numb we started to think about how it might have turned out
5677471 on the night there were two kids killed with knives one in london and one in greater manchester
5677472 weve all been in fisticuffs as youngsters but to get a knife and stab somebody that many times i just dont understand it you worry about your kids society seems to have changed theres much more violence around
5677473 you hear about it all the time about how kids carry knives for protection its crazy i just cant understand the mentality of somebody who wants to do that
5677474 the police and partner agencies have worked extremely hard to increase the speed at which they deal with young offenders to ensure they face the consequences of their behaviour quickly
5677475 the speed at which charges are now processed may well mean that young offenders are likely to appear in court after each individual incident rather than seeing them build up to be dealt with in one court hearing
5677476 consequently an increased number of young offenders are now being recorded as persistent this does not necessarily indicate any increase in the number of crimes being committed
5677477 once dealt with for their offences the youth offending service and partners work closely with young people to reduce the risks of further criminal activity
5677478 young offenders are now being dealt with twice as quickly as they were prior to 1997 which means that there are much shorter intervals between sentencing occasions for those youths who repeatedly offend youth sentencing is therefore more timely and for repeat offenders more frequent than it used to be
5677479 i think that it too early in the season to make any predictions but id be happy with a point
5677480 hopefully well get another draw at your place 0 0 1 1
5677481 its hard to say from what i saw this weekend
5677482 queitly confident that we can come away from st james with at least a point
5677483 its really hard to call this early in the season but ill be expecting an opening 20 minutes onslaught from the mags after their performance at ot and with an expectant home crowd at sjp the rest of the game and the crowd noise will depend largely on what transpires from this opening salvo if we manage to contain you i can see a point in it for us or even a late nicked win but my head says probably the 3 points will be yours courtesy of a 2 0
5677484 better than last mid table with hopefully a decent cup run
5677485 between 10th 17th as per every season there will only be single figures between these places so itll be close the media are as per usual writing us off again so thats all we need in the motivation stakes and from what i saw against an admittedly bad stoke team well be ok a lot will depend on if we can score more than last year or defensive record wasnt as bad as many of the teams down with us last season we conceded less than you with 54 our main problem was goals only wigan and derby scored less than us and it was our achilles heel both with and without anelka ill stick my neck out and say 14th
5677486 quietly optimistic though i think a lot depends on our back four staying injury free especially our centre pairing if elmander can contunue the form hes started with well be treated to a quality creative striker that can give us a 10 15 goal return this season yet its muamba that newcastle will need to avoid on saturday the lad looks a real quality signing with a natural ability to break any momentum the opposing midfield gains we look a very balanced side at the minute and a long way from the abortion you faced at the start of last season i see no reason why bolton will not end this season nicely poised in mid table
5677487 its really hard to say i think we are one player short of a nailed on mid table side the talk is of bullard and i think hed fit in well and improve us i said 16th at the start of the season and tbh survival without going through the wringer would suite me this year
5677488 if you played like you did against the rags also alot better than what the experts think
5677489 europe through a cup competition youll be mid table too
5677490 well youll start full of confidence and im sure after sunday the talk of the toon is europe but as ever itll be a false dawn you may get into the top 8 but to be honest id say much the same as us as per usual youll be inconsistent and granted guittirez and coloccini had promising debuts but will they cut the mustard when you visit the smoggies on a cold night in february owen will be croaked half the season and viduka isnt getting any younger kk may have another hissy fit and quit infact id be surprised if kk is still your manager come may what ever the set up is up there with wise and the other chap buying players with no input for keegan its just mad neck out again and youll be in about 10th keegan will get fed up when wise brings in tore andre flo and jodi morris because theyll add a chelsea spirit and resign ashley will wonder what to do and itll turn out to be wises master plan to get a premier league job and take over the reigns and youll drop to about 16th
5677491 my honest answer christ only knows you have so much talent in your team with so many attack minded players yet like spurs newcastle never seam to take much care of there defence lets face it youve had some humdingers playing in defence for you in the past keegan is a good man manager great at motivation yet quite poor as a tactician your season will depend on the fitness and form of your strikers owen martins and viduka wont mention smith as hes bobbins if you had a good defence youd have quite some team more then able to reach europe as it is newcastle have always spent huge amounts on players followed by appointing poor managers or not giving a manger enough time to hang up his coat before immediate success is demanded can keegan take newcastle to a place in the league that would justify the money spent on his squad i very much doubt it 9th would be a decent season for your lot this year
5677492 for newcastle read spurs plenty of attacking intent and some high profile players but a seeming inability to make the whole reach the sum of the parts and usually a far from convincing record away from sjp i think youll flirt equally with the mid bottom and mid top then settle somewhere between 8th and 10th all achieved whilst receiving lottery payouts because of owens injuries

5677507 laatst had ik xtc pillen in een pakje peuken verstopt ik zat wel even te shaken of ik niet gepakt zou worden toen heb ik die pil op de wc ingenomen met een slok water
5677508 er is geen gedoogbeleid hier de gemeente bepaalt dat bezoekers gefouilleerd worden en wij volgen dit het aantal drugs dat dit jaar gevonden wordt is laag natuurlijk zitten er geheid mensen bij die wel gebruiken maar op ons festival zie je niet dat er openlijk pillen uitgedeeld worden ik denk dat we het aardig onder controle hebben
5677509 nederland staat bekend als een drugstolerant land deze regering met de christenunie wil dit imago nu bijstellen
5677510 bezoekers zullen nu voor de ingang meer drugs tegelijk innemen wat gevaarlijk kan zijn voor de gezondheid ook zal er meer alchol gedronken worden als vervanging van drugs
5677511 dit dancefeest duurt twaalf uur een xtc pil werkt vijf uur en dan heb je op deze party een hangover als je m van tevoren inneemt ik denk dat de meeste bezoekers niets willen missen van het festival en niet met een kater rond willen lopen en daarom niet onder invloed zijn

5677516 its great to see but im not surprised with how big salsa has become
5677517 it definitely makes for interesting conversations when you meet someone and theyre like what do you do
5677518 well look i mean reggie is 20 years younger than me
5677519 the 350 mile long maginot line cost france about 150 million in the 1930s or about 2 3 billion in todays dollars this puts the cost of the maginot line underground tunnels bunkers gun emplacements and all at 6 5 million current dollars per mile
5677520 one end of this san diego wall hangs in the air meaning it just ends hundreds of miles before the border does allowing it to be easily flanked
5677521 we are definitely going to appeal because the test results of the same samples are different

5677526 we have seen media reports indicating that people are being shot at while trying to leave the area
5677527 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response
5677528 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5677529 in my opinion gerrard is one of the best midfield players in europe even in the world
5677530 he is the leader in liverpool they wouldnt be where they are without him and thats what they should do in the england side give him the freedom let him feel he is the main man and then he will deliver
5677531 in the dressing room he doesnt speak that much hes quite quiet but he does his talking on the pitch
5677532 i dont think i played a game healthy last season i was at about 50 or 60 per cent at best
5677533 when i had another scan on the knee this summer it had not improved so i came back early to try to fix it at the beginning of pre season
5677534 whether i am fit for portsmouth on monday or the match after that the most important thing is i am healthy for the rest of the season
5677535 im trying to get another start at manchester united and as many starts as i can
5677536 i havent changed my mind i want to join everton
5677537 we are still in contact i hope now that rennes will accept to enter into negotiations with this english club
5677538 he cant be captain of the team on the bench i pick over what ive seen over the last two or three weeks and weve lifted the standard
5677539 now i look on the bench and i see dean sitting there along with carlos edwards michael chopra and anthony stokes
5677540 journalists come up with things maybe a bit of stirring the west ham kind of side
5677541 we have to get behind him and support him because he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team you want your own fans to be behind him
5677542 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides but overall i am positive he will recover
5677543 i dont see myself as a right back but i was texting luke young before the game and he gave me some tips so i was well happy
5677544 on a hybrid that really isnt one when there dont seem to be any obvious benefits
5677545 yes the two jitender and vijender were a little upset at akhils loss but they are ready to come out and give it all
5677546 the win over olympic champion artayev has given me a tremendous boost
5677547 what we thought was ours we lost akhils quarter finals so i cant say about next bouts but i only hope that we will win two medals
5677548 there is no question of underestimating carlos at this level one just can not under estimate any opponent and as far as carlos is considered he has been put in the sleeper category by the experts
5677549 as soon as i came to flagstaff i felt at home in a way i hadnt felt probably anyplace else ive ever lived
5677550 its the people its the arts its the free exchange of ideas the natural surroundings
5677551 right now my drivers license has my flagstaff address and im registered to vote in flagstaff i care more about flagstaff
5677552 it sounds terrible because ive had a home in the valley for 16 years now
5677553 like many of us they would say boy when i can i would really like to live in one of these beautiful scenic areas
5677554 and as they get close to retirement they can fulfill those wishes
5677555 you get the wave of the baby boom which is bigger than the wave before it and on top of that the baby boomers are more likely to purchase these second homes or amenity homes or move to these areas
5677556 people come to the nice little mountain town so pretty soon guess what they want to live here or at least have a part time home
5677557 start to change it into the place where they came from another park or some walking trails near their home or god forbid a starbucks
5677558 they certainly push the housing market up and the people who want to live here and stay here full time cant afford the houses
5677559 so either they struggle or theyre forced to move somewhere else
5677560 one income families here city officials might as well put up a sign that says stay away
5677561 because unless you come with wealth its hard to make it here
5677562 i was surprised that even once you found it you werent getting paid enough to stay in flagstaff
5677563 people would give their eyeteeth to stay in flagstaff and they are giving their eyeteeth to stay in flagstaff
5677564 and one of the things that struck us was in los angeles in the big metropolitan areas youre kind of anonymous
5677565 and here youre walking down the street and people are saying hi to us and nodding and making eye contact
5677566 and you know it was a little uncomfortable at first because were not used to this
5677567 so here we are and my husband is still working in california and commutes back and forth
5677568 he flies out on monday evening and comes home friday morning so hes home for the weekends meanwhile im up here living in paradise
5677569 the chamber of commerce and the boosters have sought growth for as long as i can remember

5677573 en caso de que las consultas no desemboquen en una soluci n aceptable la comisi n podr a tomar medidas adecuadas ello podr a incluir una
5677574 if kashmir is to be treated as an inte gral part of india
5677575 india must adhere to its constitution and the kashmiris should be allowed to enjoy the freedom that is guaranteed to them by that constitution
5677576 true freedom in jammu and kashmir cannot be won by independence which would bring even more suffering and would be unacceptable to both india and pakistan
5677577 kashmirs forests have been among the principal casualties of violence
5677578 people in the security forces set about felling trees to build their homes in villages across punjab and haryana
5677579 quickly lost steam possibly because it put political leaders and senior bureaucrats under increased public scrutiny
5677580 had played no role in the decrease in violence and the kashmir issue figured low on the us agenda in talks with pakistan
5677581 he reflected little apprehension of the isi a characteristic of previous conversations
5677582 due to a calculated and cynical effort to convert a movement fuelled by public disaffection on civil issues into a religious insurrection
5677583 few regions in the world have had worse luck than kashmir in the matter of government
5677584 audience responses to douglas sirk in the u s and japan
5677585 in the u s screenings of sirk masterpieces such as
5677586 how different things are in japan was proved at the sirk retrospective of the pia film festival in july
5677587 dorothy malone s performance as the rich nymphomaniac marylee in written on the wind generally comes in for gusts of derision from american audiences who bray at her as if sirk were a cross between tex avery and russ meyer the japanese silence before marylees larger than life compulsions lent sirks film for all its garishness a racinian dignity that an american audience wouldnt let stand for a second

5677589 light hearted documentary celebrates the lives of gay men their bonding sense of brotherhood and quest to explore non urban adventures
5677590 scoop i found to be a trivial little kleenex of a film amusing provided you like me and you like scarlett johansson but its not worth much in the scheme of things if youre not doing anything on a hot afternoon and you want to get into the air conditioning you can watch it
5677591 the enemy of islam is gone pervez musharraf is gone
5677592 musharraf had some very good ideas which were workable and durable the the present pakistan government should continue with the same approach
5677593 whatever the dictator would have done to take the indo pak peace process forward and resolve the kashmir dispute would have lacked a democratic stamp
5677594 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
5677595 to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
5677596 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5677597 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5677598 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5677599 id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it
5677600 my target now is to qualify for the world cup and thats the aim going forward
5677601 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5677602 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5677603 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team

5677624 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign
5677625 i leave my future in the hands of the people
5677626 not a single charge in the impeachment can stand against me
5677627 no charge can be proved against me because i never did anything for myself it was all for pakistan
5677628 on the map of the world pakistan is now an important country by the grace of allah
5677629 there is a lack of coal not a lack of installed power capacity
5677630 the integration of assetmark and genworth financial asset management creates a unique opportunity to bring together two companies with deep roots in the independent advisory business and a shared vision for the future
5677631 we were able to examine what each company did well individually blend the best of both platforms and create new tools and services to meet the evolving needs of independent financial advisors
5677632 every year we have more russians coming for house hunting along the riviera
5677633 are only several villas between 60 and 150 million available
5677634 ive got some people going out to see properties from 100 million to 140 million that area in the riviera is absolutely nuts

5677662 na da haben wir es den arbeitslosen wieder gezeigt warum bringen sie sich auch nicht einfach um anstatt der allgemeinheit auf der tasche zu liegen
5677663 the public doesnt know who on earth john mccain is
5677664 there is no doubt that the israeli regime and people are both against islam and muslims occupying their lands so how could we speak of friendship with them
5677665 why should people who think like that be one of the presidents colleagues
5677666 i have said before that we do not have any hostility against the israeli people and i still say the same thing proudly
5677667 then it disappeared behind the trees and never came back up
5677668 he was a beloved educator a consummate professional and a humanitarian in every since of the word
5677669 he was the kind of guy who devoted a lot of time and effort to those who needed it its a huge loss not just for our district but to the community
5677670 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5677671 it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support
5677672 she is totally fine with it we laughed its a great campaign and im very honored to be part of it
5677673 we love england it is where we are both from and our families are from but were very happy here and things are going so well
5677674 were enjoying it and everyone has been so great to us we are really happy here
5677675 we have so much of her unsold stock we cant even give it away
5677676 i dont really understand why its not already legal everywhere
5677677 she wants to say shes sorry for everything but that probably wouldnt work when it comes to the dynamics of the show
5677678 heidi and audrina are still cool but not for me
5677679 are fighting for the cause standing shoulder to shoulder with men
5677680 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5677681 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5677682 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5677683 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5677684 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5677685 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5677686 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5677687 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5677688 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power
5677689 i did give documents a long time ago but these matters have been resolved for a long time now as far as im concerned
5677690 it was a barbaric act despite all facilities we offered to this force who didnt respect the law
5677691 some critics say japanese mobile technology tends to be quirky like the galapagos islands
5677692 but asian nations such as taiwan and south korea have for years expressed great interest in japanese cell phones
5677693 inciting others to take part in it and arranging for himself and others to attend military training in pakistan in preparation for going to fight and inevitably to kill
5677694 were the necessary tools of their trade possessed to be used in furtherance of that violent cause
5677695 kill our people on your land and we will crush you
5677696 if someone thinks they can kill our citizens kill soldiers and officers fulfilling the role of peacekeepers we will never allow this
5677697 anyone who tries to do this will receive a shattering blow
5677698 our so called leaders prostituted us to the west destroyed our culture our economies our honor our blood has been spilled on our soil my blood on their hands they are the invaders all us and british forces will leave russia immediately or suffer the consequences
5677699 the difficulty with this calf in our view is that it probably hasnt weaned itself from its mother and that is why it is taking to yachts the prognosis isnt good
5677700 its heart wrenching but the reality is that in the wild for various reasons mothers sometimes reject their young
5677701 our hi tech electronic borders system will allow us to count all foreign nationals in and out of the uk while checking them against watch lists
5677702 these checks make up just one part of britains triple ring of security alongside fingerprint visas for three quarters of the worlds population and the roll out of id cards for foreign nationals locking people to one identity

5677743 at the end of the day i would say the only way the consumer jumps in is if its subsidized
5677744 wed have to see a price point of somewhere around 200 to really show that theyre rim going after the apple market the iphone market or at least be more in the same ballpark
5677745 ouch and here i was still hoping that it would come in at 299 like the 16 gig iphone 3g silly me
5677746 it really comes down to what you need more in a phone while the bold certainly has improved media and other consumer features it really is a business device at the end of the day
5677747 the iphone 3g is a consumer device that happens to play nice with a lot of corporations and we honestly think you wont find many people dropping their blackberrys for an iphone theyll carry both as long as they can afford it
5677748 so some enterprise user who is very internet centric would certainly want to take advantage of the bold on the other hand somebody who may use it more for email applications for the most part the appeal isnt there

5677778 la testimonianza daffetto che viene oggi da tutta la citt nei confronti di franco sensi una testimonianza della stessa natura di quella arrivata per alberto sordi questa citt ama i romani veri che vivono conoscono e danno qualcosa alla citt franco sensi ha dato moltissimo non solo alla roma ma anche alla citt di roma e una grande emozione vedere centinaia e centinaia di persone la giusta riconoscenza per un uomo simpatico schietto sincero e tipicamente romano che aveva una grande passione e una finissima intelligenza la cosa bella che questo percorso verr ora intrapreso dalle figlie vero amore del presidente oltre alla roma ha saputo far convivere i suoi amori nel modo migliore alla famiglia ho ricordato quando abbiamo festeggiato proprio qui dentro i suoi 80 anni fu molto bello perch ci univa unamicizia profonda che andava al di l della mia persona visto che lui e mio padre erano amici stato un uomo di sport innamorato di roma e credo di poter essere fra quelli che possono testimoniare quanto la famiglia sensi abbia fatto per la citt anche al di l di quello che si sa negli anni in cui sono stato sindaco ho potuto misurare lamore la passione e limmensa generosit messi a disposizione da sensi per fare della roma una grande squadra e quello di oggi un atto di riconoscenza rispetto e simpatia nei confronti di un uomo fuori dagli schemi tradizionali e dallintelligenza finissima

5677780 the critical choice to join the fight against al qaeda the taliban and other extremist groups
5677781 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan
5677782 partly because the u s stayed in visible support of musharraf even after it became clear that the voters had rejected him
5677783 shut up and do absolutely nothing but respond to initiatives from the new government
5677784 the central terrorist threat to the united states lies in northwest pakistan and afghanistan and not iraq
5677785 more than once i heard him say as we drove over the jimtown bridge what a beautiful place it was
5677786 he felt very strongly and very emotionally about the valley
5677787 we hoped it would work and called uc davis and a guy there told us it was too hot it wont work but wed been to napa enough times to know that alexander valley was no hotter
5677788 of course it made it possible for us to begin construction of the new emergency department in the summer of 2006
5677789 he did the new york times crossword puzzle every day usually in about 15 minutes and in ink competing with other employees to see who would finish first
5677790 people are out looking for bargains i think youre going to see continued softening of prices into next year
5677791 the good news is a lot of it is moving quickly
5677792 the sooner we clear through the bank owned inventory the sooner we will start to see the appreciation in prices start to swing up but that could be another year its just a matter of time to flush that out
5677793 there are a lot of people that have good credit and a job but were on the sidelines because they couldnt afford a home and theres always investors weve got both of them coming in
5677794 were seeing multiple offers on almost every bank owned home thats in livable condition
5677795 folks are seeing the opportunities out there the selection buyers have to choose from is tremendous
5677796 we havent seen anything like this in a couple of years it certainly appears that we have a sustainable trend here
5677797 weve essentially got to work through the foreclosures that we know are coming over the next six to 12 months so its just a longer period of time where youre just kind of bouncing along the bottom
5677798 you know if i hang out with you and someone finds out i will go to jail i will be called a pedophile
5677799 there are staff that are extraordinarily kind there are staff that are singling her out for special attention
5677800 theres nowhere she can go to be alone theres nowhere she can go to get peace
5677801 we feel shes well managed we havent heard about any outward threats by other prisoners we train our staff to treat all our prisoners equally
5677802 all the time and effort and energy they spent all goes for naught and theyre going to have to start over if they are going to do anything or appeal
5677803 either way i think we are in a much much better position
5677804 any mechanism where this city can purge itself of wrongdoing
5677805 we have to abide by the order of the court well review with mr goodman all our options
5677806 i think thats the appropriate venue its been the appropriate venue all along
5677807 doesnt have the means to do anything in ukraine like it has in georgia
5677808 we need to make sure not a single hair on their heads gets hurt
5677809 if even one russian soldier dies then russia will punish us even more
5677810 all of our guys was in south ossetia we was only about 200 soldiers here
5677811 the port was bombed and several people died as you know and even one of my friends he was injured
5677812 we need to make sure not a single hair on their heads gets hurt
5677813 if even one russian soldier dies then russia will punish us even more
5677814 all of our guys was in south ossetia we was only about 200 soldiers here
5677815 the port was bombed and several people died as you know and even one of my friends he was injured
5677816 con la mia vittoria ha detto ho dimostrato che a volte anche le cose impossibili succedono sono contentissimo e sereno lo volevo me laspettavo sono stato bene per tutta la settimana sentivo di potercela fare adesso voglio loro del 2012
5677817 daughters i kissed a girl hit is shameful and disgusting
5677818 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5677819 the charges created a circumstance that would have made it uncomfortable
5677820 laying a 30 trillion deficit on future generations of americans
5677821 thats not sustainable and yet we continue to mortgage our childrens futures
5677822 if we dont deal with them soon were going to be making our children and our grandchildren poorer
5677823 people like bill gates warren buffet dont need their prescriptions underwritten by taxpayers
5677824 those who can afford to buy their own prescription drugs should be expected to do so
5677825 now if you take zocor youre paying about 10 times what those in the va system pay just because the va system was allowed to negotiate for prescription drugs
5677826 and the medicare benefit we decided we wouldnt do it that obviously is an enormous mistake
5677827 its not going to save you a lot of money until you start to pull down what you treat as high income to a much much lower level than most people think of as high income
5677828 to get substantial resources youd have to talk about making changes that would affect people who have incomes of 50 000 or less
5677829 its either going to be taxpayers or the beneficiaries of the program or the people who provide the services and nobody wants to tackle any of those groups because theyre all going to scream very loudly if they suddenly have to bear a lot of the burden of the future of medicare
5677830 the critical choice to join the fight against al qaeda the taliban and other extremist groups
5677831 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan
5677832 partly because the u s stayed in visible support of musharraf even after it became clear that the voters had rejected him
5677833 shut up and do absolutely nothing but respond to initiatives from the new government
5677834 the central terrorist threat to the united states lies in northwest pakistan and afghanistan and not iraq
5677835 we need to make sure not a single hair on their heads gets hurt
5677836 if even one russian soldier dies then russia will punish us even more
5677837 all of our guys was in south ossetia we was only about 200 soldiers here
5677838 the port was bombed and several people died as you know and even one of my friends he was injured
5677839 as soon as i came to flagstaff i felt at home in a way i hadnt felt probably anyplace else ive ever lived
5677840 its the people its the arts its the free exchange of ideas the natural surroundings
5677841 right now my drivers license has my flagstaff address and im registered to vote in flagstaff i care more about flagstaff
5677842 it sounds terrible because ive had a home in the valley for 16 years now
5677843 like many of us they would say boy when i can i would really like to live in one of these beautiful scenic areas
5677844 and as they get close to retirement they can fulfill those wishes
5677845 you get the wave of the baby boom which is bigger than the wave before it and on top of that the baby boomers are more likely to purchase these second homes or amenity homes or move to these areas
5677846 people come to the nice little mountain town so pretty soon guess what they want to live here or at least have a part time home
5677847 start to change it into the place where they came from another park or some walking trails near their home or god forbid a starbucks
5677848 they certainly push the housing market up and the people who want to live here and stay here full time cant afford the houses
5677849 so either they struggle or theyre forced to move somewhere else
5677850 one income families here city officials might as well put up a sign that says stay away
5677851 because unless you come with wealth its hard to make it here
5677852 i was surprised that even once you found it you werent getting paid enough to stay in flagstaff
5677853 people would give their eyeteeth to stay in flagstaff and they are giving their eyeteeth to stay in flagstaff
5677854 and one of the things that struck us was in los angeles in the big metropolitan areas youre kind of anonymous
5677855 and here youre walking down the street and people are saying hi to us and nodding and making eye contact
5677856 and you know it was a little uncomfortable at first because were not used to this
5677857 so here we are and my husband is still working in california and commutes back and forth
5677858 he flies out on monday evening and comes home friday morning so hes home for the weekends meanwhile im up here living in paradise
5677859 the chamber of commerce and the boosters have sought growth for as long as i can remember
5677860 i got a call from a college president who was saying they were going to renovate a building which he thought was very beautiful
5677861 dont do it youll destroy the building go raise 1 million and put up a megawatt of wind power on a family farm in western minnesota let that farmer send his kids to college and pay his mortgage and youll produce a megawatt of power which is more than youll need for your building
5677862 eu iria al m e diria que o pior ainda est por vir
5677863 n s n o vamos ver apenas bancos de porte m dio quebrando nos pr ximos meses
5677864 n s vamos ver um grande quebrando um dos grandes bancos de investimento ou outro grande banco
5677865 n s veremos uma maior consolida o no setor financeiro antes que isso chegue ao fim
5677866 vous tes gentil mais je ne suis pas int ress par la datation vous sans compter que moi ai rencontr lamour de ma vie
5677867 ive been doing this quite a while and i know exactly what youre talking about you dont have to explain it to me
5677868 you know what the problem is either he likes you too much or not enough
5677869 i know what to do stop waiting but i dont know how to do it
5677870 the number of dth tv homes is likely to grow by an additional 11 12 million in a year from now and we aim to have 40 per cent market share of that
5677871 we are ready to provide the service to five million homes
5677872 so far in his interrogation he has confessed to his involvement in the ahmedabad blasts
5677873 though bashir is cooperating in interrogation he is not revealing much details he is just giving short replies to the questions asked by the officials most of his replies are in yes and no
5677874 i feel that the number of colors in the piece might be a bit excessive
5677875 if you want the guy to look really cool you should give him giant metal bat wings thatd be awesome
5677876 im not getting a strong impression of the character from this sketch
5677877 i dont care for you and youre not getting a raise ever
5677878 i cant justify giving you a raise until we deal with some of these issues lets put together a plan of action
5677879 what sort of emotional reaction are you having to the use of color
5677880 well if you dont think hes a cool looking character youre just not getting my vision
5677881 there was less blood loss with this procedure than with conventional surgery and there is the potential for a faster recovery
5677882 the results were outstanding and suggest the robot assisted surgery is an attractive option for fistulas that would normally require abdominal surgery
5677883 robot assisted surgery has promise to bridge the limitations of laparoscopic surgery and allow more women with fistulas urinary incontinence or prolapsed pelvic organs to benefit from a minimally invasive approach
5677884 were born with the ability to see the world numerically just as were born to see the world in colour
5677885 carl woese and his colleagues years ago established that protein translation had to be well developed when the evolution of modern cells started
5677886 so the evolution of cells and the evolution of translation are really linked to one another
5677887 to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
5677888 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5677889 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
5677890 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5677891 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles
5677892 shariah funding is suitable for india when stock markets are falling and debt market is drying up in the country in the coming years we can see a significant shariah funding in the country said ambar maheshwari of global investment advisory dtz
5677893 given the current global economic situation fund raising is slightly challenging however if the fund manager can withstand the due diligence of investors then there is substantial money available for india kapoor said

5677896 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
5677897 most us consumers are happy with dvds according to a recent study by abi research and dont believe blu ray provides as big of a quality jump as dvds did over vhs tapes
5677898 i think it would be a benefit for the public to know when the committee is meeting and to be able to see the information as the committee meets that ultimately will be presented in a report
5677899 dies ist der erste positive nachweis des spiegeltests an einem nicht s ugetier
5677900 how many people getting shot or killed is it going to take
5677901 if other people can shut them down why cant we
5677902 when these guys are robbing these places are they carrying out big bags of stuffed rabbits
5677903 of course not theyve got cash they have to know theyre paying out
5677904 everyone else around is at risk when theres a robber
5677905 its in our neighborhood in a lot of towns thats not the case here theyre amid our homes
5677906 there are some people that are pretty doggone tired of that and i think they have a reason to be
5677907 i tell them as soon as you come in im going to bust you
5677908 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5677909 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5677910 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks

5677926 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the federal version was approved the state version was not the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion

5677929 ouch and here i was still hoping that it would come in at 299 like the 16 gig iphone 3g silly me
5677930 it really comes down to what you need more in a phone while the bold certainly has improved media and other consumer features it really is a business device at the end of the day
5677931 the iphone 3g is a consumer device that happens to play nice with a lot of corporations and we honestly think you wont find many people dropping their blackberrys for an iphone theyll carry both as long as they can afford it
5677932 so some enterprise user who is very internet centric would certainly want to take advantage of the bold on the other hand somebody who may use it more for email applications for the most part the appeal isnt there

5677966 finalmente ci siamo arrivano le partite che contano sostiene il centrocampista quelle da tre punti che ti danno una carica in pi durante il precampionato le amichevoli svolte sono servite a trovare la migliore condizione adesso per si fa sul serio il palermo tiene in grande considerazione la coppa italia e cos diventa indispensabile il passaggio del turno
5677967 e vero sostiene migliaccio spesso le squadre di categoria inferiore raddoppiano le forze contro le formazioni della massima serie ma sono certo che disputeremo una bella partita quello che non condivido il paragone fatto con lamichevole di portogruaro perch stata una partita anomala giocata in condizioni climatiche per noi proibitive dopo il lungo periodo trascorso in austria per ripeto il palermo tiene molto alla coppa italia
5677968 per carit sorride giulio nessuno in questa squadra ha il posto garantito solo il lavoro settimanale e le scelte del nostro mister diranno se meriter di giocare sono rimasto a palermo con la volont di far bene e di continuare a dare il contributo la squadra sta crescendo notevolmente siamo gi al 70 80 della condizione e raggiungeremo il top dopo le prime giornate del campionato stiamo crescendo bene e con tantissimo entusiasmo siamo un mix di giocatori giovani e di esperienza che potr fare benissimo personalmente continua lex atalantino non mi sbilancio nei pronostici ma di sicuro il primo obiettivo della squadra sar quello di migliorare la posizione finale di classifica dello scorso campionato che sinceramente stata deludente

5678004 as soldiers prepare for conflict the department of defense may call on the neurophysiology community to assist in maintaining the warfighting superiority of the united states commanders will ask how they can make their troops learn faster how can they increase the speed with which their soldiers process large amounts of information quickly and accurately how can the neurosciences help soldiers to make the correct decision in the difficult environment of wartime operations although conflict has many aspects one that warfighters and policy makers often talk about is the motivation to fight which undoubtedly has its origins in the brain and is reflected in peripheral neurophysiological processes
5678005 so one question would be how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight other questions raised by controlling the mind how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands as cognitive neuroscience and related technologies become more pervasive using technology for nefarious purposes becomes easier
5678006 the brain is viewed as the organ most associated with personal identity
5678007 there is sure to be enormous societal interest in any prospective manipulation of neural processes
5678008 the fear that this approach to fighting war might be developed will be justification for developing countermeasures to possible cognitive weapons this escalation might lead to innovations that could cause this market area to expand rapidly tests would need to be developed to determine if a soldier had been harmed by a cognitive weapon and there would be a need for a prophylactic of some sort
5678009 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that someday there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
5678010 my big concern is that everyones so hell bent on decriminalising abortion we might forget to put in place the support and care systems that women and couples need
5678011 women who are considering an abortion need more information and better decision making counselling
5678012 women need to be badgered out of having an abortion and should definitely not be referred for same

5678025 we should all be grateful that the princeton review has taken action over this data breach but it should never have happened in the first place
5678026 the information should have been held securely and identifying data such as names and full dates of birth should have been wiped from the files
5678027 we agree it was rather high for the time of year its possible mr purdey has been charged for the gas used up during the explosion that destroyed his house
5678028 its basically a comet but it never gets close enough to the sun to develop a long bright tail of evaporated gas and dust

5678030 it could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked to large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus
5678031 however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the oort cloud

5678040 he was frosty at first he felt betrayed when she dumped him for his friend lance but after a while he caved in and has been sweet to her
5678041 i want them to be interested in their own lives and their own accomplishments i dont want them to be interested in mine mine are of no consequence to them i am their mother thats all i want to be to them not some artist who discusses her work with them i dont care if they appreciate my artistry i just want them to appreciate my unconditional love
5678042 the time when i began to see the most clearly was after i turned 30 i was 31 or 32 and i quit smoking i was so emotional i mean everybody is emotional when they quit smoking but i had been so unhappy and i realized that i had just been i dont know literally stuffing it back with those cigarettes in my mouth i felt like i woke up suddenly
5678043 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5678044 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5678045 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5678046 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5678047 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here

5678054 this is not a republican state its not a democratic state
5678055 were a mixed electorate in terms of numbers of democrats republicans and independents
5678056 when looking at this and i want to be as serious as possible
5678057 dozens of people from the shiite community had gathered at the hospital where the bomb went off
5678058 as you know there has been sectarian tension here and this wave keeps decreasing and increasing so now we are having this sectarian wave a bit more and this is the result
5678059 on one hand theres a simple and basic interface to search
5678060 but google is also known as an innovative company and has other great apps that are slowly starting to gain market share as they launch these things sometimes it takes a while until users get to know it
5678061 satisfaction in simple terms is a combination of what you get and what you expect

5678070 while russia walks tall saakashvili will struggle to survive as one of the worlds youngest presidents the europeans are already divided and vulnerable to charges of indecision and impotence nato splits over georgia and ukraine will widen american policies in the region have been severely set back western energy policy is looking flaky
5678071 as any politician lech kaczy ski has the right to have his own opinion he may be an anti communist and a russophobe but he was elected president to care about the interests of his country not the interests of georgia its security or saakashvili it is not his task to defend the us position in this region to say nothing of his own unrealistic projects
5678072 absolutely understands the russian reaction because it was the georgians who attacked russian peacekeepers not the other way round
5678073 the point is the party is united were coming together
5678074 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen

5678076 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5678077 the churchs obligation to participate in shaping the moral character of society is a requirement of our faith

5678086 we are engaging with gen y in a really ongoing way
5678087 hip hop wouldnt be what it is without isaac hayes
5678088 people are carrying out breeding which would be first of all entirely illegal in humans and secondly is absolutely insane from the point of view of the health of the animals in some breeds they are paying a terrible terrible price in genetic disease
5678089 the show world is about an obsession about beauty and there is a ridiculous concept that that is how we should judge dogs it takes no account of your temperament your fitness for purpose potentially as a pet animal and that to me makes no sense at all it is a parade of mutants a freakish garish beauty pageant
5678090 the kennel club is working tirelessly to help improve the health of pedigree dogs any dog may be shown but it is up to the judge to decide if it fits the breed standard
5678091 it is when characteristics become exaggerated that health problems can occur this is something that the kennel club does not encourage and actively educates people including judges against doing as part of its fit for function fit for life campaign
5678092 if they milf cant control them the government will certainly control them and we will undertake our mandate to protect the people and the communities and we cannot renege on that constitutional mandate
5678093 we will pursue and take aggressive action against the perpetrators of the dastardly acts committed against innocent civilians
5678094 we are pleased to be working with hovon one of the most prestigious clinical groups in hematology oncology we continue to believe that cloretazine r will have broad utility in the treatment of hematological malignancies as both a single agent and in combination with other therapies this trial will provide important data with regard to cloretazine r s utility in the treatment of aml when given in combination with standard remission induction therapy for this devastating disease
5678095 hovon is focusing on the clinical development of new therapeutic options for patients with leukemia laromustine is a promising agent for that effort
5678096 since teliks development focus does not include metabolic diseases like diabetes we have sought a licensee for this program
5678097 we believe receptorbios principals who are accomplished leaders in the field of diabetes treatment have the appropriate skills and experience to advance this program
5678098 weve all read about the infamous it girls the young women whosetime in the limelight is defined as much by their very public personalstruggles as by their achievements and accolades
5678099 however the winners of the it girlessentials contest exemplify a whole new generation of women who areconcerned active and effective in their communities and in their world
5678100 in phase 2 clinical trials telaprevir based regimens have demonstrated the potential to increase sustained viral response rates across a broad spectrum of patients infected with the hepatitis c virus including patients who failed to achieve svr with previous pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy many of whom are at high risk for life threatening hcv related complications
5678101 the realize trial of telaprevir is a landmark phase 3 trial of an investigational hcv protease inhibitor in null responder and other patients who failed prior treatment and will seek to generate additional data to demonstrate the benefit of telaprevir in this difficult to treat patient population
5678102 approximately 6 million patients are chronically infected with hepatitis c in the u s and e u today and approximately 650 000 of these patients have failed previous treatments of pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy and are in need of a new therapeutic option to treat their disease
5678103 data generated from this phase 3 trial in treatment failure patients as well as data from the ongoing phase 3 advance trial in treatment naive patients may further contribute to the emerging profile of telaprevir to address the significant medical need in both treatment naive and treatment failure patients
5678104 home care is part of thesolution to the problem of rapidly increasing medicare spending foramericas seniors
5678105 home care is cost effective and it provides independence for seniorsand people with disabilities

5678107 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5678108 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5678109 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are uphappy with their lot
5678110 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
5678111 and really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5678112 this agreement marks an important milestone in our masp 2 program and ensures that omeros can access high affinity fully human antibodies against masp 2
5678113 we are impressed by affitechs technology track record and personnel and look forward to our collaboration

5678131 in fact over time even religion changes as we learn more weve been called to change and there are lots of people who think the church should change and perhaps like jesus were being called to change our minds rather than called to keep upholding the past

5678152 theyre running stop signs and theyre not paying attention to the road ahead of them so its more to themselves because theyre in an open vehicle and if there is a crash theyre gonna sustain serious injuries most likely
5678153 once thieves spot the gps or other valuable item in the car they smash the glass grab the item and leave the scene
5678154 in order to entice a thief to commit a smash and grab style break in they must see something of value in the vehicle that makes the crime worth the risk these types of thefts are hard to solve given the lack of physical evidence and cooperation from the public

5678189 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
5678190 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
5678191 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
5678192 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
5678193 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
5678194 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
5678195 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
5678196 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
5678197 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
5678198 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
5678199 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
5678200 there was absolutely no reason to involve the ag since he does not act for the kenya anti corruption commission in civil matters
5678201 cbk is a statutory body it has its own lawyers and it is not represented by the ag
5678202 we need to make sure not a single hair on their heads gets hurt
5678203 if even one russian soldier dies then russia will punish us even more
5678204 all of our guys was in south ossetia we was only about 200 soldiers here
5678205 the port was bombed and several people died as you know and even one of my friends he was injured
5678206 as soon as i came to flagstaff i felt at home in a way i hadnt felt probably anyplace else ive ever lived
5678207 its the people its the arts its the free exchange of ideas the natural surroundings
5678208 right now my drivers license has my flagstaff address and im registered to vote in flagstaff i care more about flagstaff
5678209 it sounds terrible because ive had a home in the valley for 16 years now
5678210 like many of us they would say boy when i can i would really like to live in one of these beautiful scenic areas
5678211 and as they get close to retirement they can fulfill those wishes
5678212 you get the wave of the baby boom which is bigger than the wave before it and on top of that the baby boomers are more likely to purchase these second homes or amenity homes or move to these areas
5678213 people come to the nice little mountain town so pretty soon guess what they want to live here or at least have a part time home
5678214 start to change it into the place where they came from another park or some walking trails near their home or god forbid a starbucks
5678215 they certainly push the housing market up and the people who want to live here and stay here full time cant afford the houses
5678216 so either they struggle or theyre forced to move somewhere else
5678217 one income families here city officials might as well put up a sign that says stay away
5678218 because unless you come with wealth its hard to make it here
5678219 i was surprised that even once you found it you werent getting paid enough to stay in flagstaff
5678220 people would give their eyeteeth to stay in flagstaff and they are giving their eyeteeth to stay in flagstaff
5678221 and one of the things that struck us was in los angeles in the big metropolitan areas youre kind of anonymous
5678222 and here youre walking down the street and people are saying hi to us and nodding and making eye contact
5678223 and you know it was a little uncomfortable at first because were not used to this
5678224 so here we are and my husband is still working in california and commutes back and forth
5678225 he flies out on monday evening and comes home friday morning so hes home for the weekends meanwhile im up here living in paradise
5678226 the chamber of commerce and the boosters have sought growth for as long as i can remember

5678229 if even one russian soldier dies then russia will punish us even more
5678230 all of our guys was in south ossetia we was only about 200 soldiers here

5678233 laying a 30 trillion deficit on future generations of americans
5678234 thats not sustainable and yet we continue to mortgage our childrens futures
5678235 if we dont deal with them soon were going to be making our children and our grandchildren poorer
5678236 people like bill gates warren buffet dont need their prescriptions underwritten by taxpayers
5678237 those who can afford to buy their own prescription drugs should be expected to do so
5678238 now if you take zocor youre paying about 10 times what those in the va system pay just because the va system was allowed to negotiate for prescription drugs
5678239 and the medicare benefit we decided we wouldnt do it that obviously is an enormous mistake
5678240 its not going to save you a lot of money until you start to pull down what you treat as high income to a much much lower level than most people think of as high income
5678241 to get substantial resources youd have to talk about making changes that would affect people who have incomes of 50 000 or less
5678242 its either going to be taxpayers or the beneficiaries of the program or the people who provide the services and nobody wants to tackle any of those groups because theyre all going to scream very loudly if they suddenly have to bear a lot of the burden of the future of medicare
5678243 the critical choice to join the fight against al qaeda the taliban and other extremist groups
5678244 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan
5678245 partly because the u s stayed in visible support of musharraf even after it became clear that the voters had rejected him
5678246 shut up and do absolutely nothing but respond to initiatives from the new government
5678247 the central terrorist threat to the united states lies in northwest pakistan and afghanistan and not iraq

5678266 rock n roll means well but cant help telling young boys lies
5678267 it might not be a great fit but its better than being closed for four days
5678268 it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting
5678269 i think we might play songs from van halen one
5678270 i think it was touching for them to have an element of nasa and space at their celebration
5678271 it could have been puzzling for them being that we were there to celebrate 400 years of quebec city and we show up with
5678272 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
5678273 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform i would ask that my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance
5678274 i can give you a definite no on that in one word no in two words hell no

5678346 i had been working on infrared reflection spectroscopy for medical imaging when andrew approached me about a possible collaboration i thought that this would be perfect for the frogs it can show us what is happening in the frogs skin but it is non invasive
5678347 this is a great example of novel and exciting interdisciplinary research that draws on expertise right across the university
5678348 with a third of the worlds amphibians currently under threat its vitally important we do our utmost to investigate the reasons why they are dying out at such an alarming rate
5678349 the imaging techniques we use do not harm the frogs in any way as an animal conservationist i simply would not allow any research that distressed these amazing creatures
5678350 and we were awakened to the fact that infectious diseases like tuberculosis really had never left
5678351 at the proteins active site the computer tries to fit drug like molecules into it to block it
5678352 with the inhibitor bound to it and try to improve on it
5678353 no matter the disease the process is always the same
5678354 whats challenging or unusual thats what keeps my job exciting
5678355 something that strikes you where you think you can make a difference
5678356 if i think someone has never tried something thats the drive for me to get into it
5678357 sometimes we try an idea and it doesnt work but being an academic means we have the freedom to try new ideas and approaches to solve a long standing problem
5678358 youve got to keep records so you know where you are spending money and what your annual cow costs are

5678360 it doesnt have to be an expensive software program it can be on a big chief tablet
5678361 but if you have a computer you can make a simple spreadsheet
5678362 producers can add 5 per hundredweight by castrating calves and when you have a 500 pound calf to market thats an added 25 per head added value
5678363 the entire success of this process hinges on whether or not you can get a functional rumen
5678364 provide a high quality palatable diet getting calves to consume an adequate ration
5678365 you will need to interact with those calves to alleviate depression and stress
5678366 the earths solid inner core started to form over a billion years ago when the liquid iron core that surrounds it became cool enough to begin solidifying it has now grown to a radius of around 1200 km but the difficulty in studying it is the thousands of kilometres of rock in the way as a result we know more about the surfaces of other planets than we do about the deep interior of our own however we have a powerful tool for studying the inner architecture of the earth
5678367 a side benefit of this network is that the data can also be used to study the deep earth looking for extremely faint vibrations passing through the very centre of the planet one such subtle signal is the seismic wave called pkjkp the properties of this wave contain a wealth of information about the earths inner core

5678369 our findings show ssws lives are dominated by an unrelenting cycle of selling sex buying drugs and then using them
5678370 this suggests they are unlikely to be able to just stop working even if the risks of punishment are increased street sex markets and the ssws poor health are the product of complex and interrelated factors and if anything these approaches will make ssws wary of contact with the police and push the women underground making them more vulnerable to violence and difficult for support services to reach
5678371 our research indicates that improvement of drug services would reduce the need to score and use drugs which is likely to reduce time spent working as well as contact with drug dealers and other users if this was linked to addressing accommodation needs and supporting contact with children then the majority of pressures forcing the women back into the cycle would also be addressed

5678414 in some ways that has been a little overstated our games have always done fine of course we didnt sell as much as halo but i wouldnt describe any of them as flops at all

5678472 de torah rol was eigenlijk bedoeld om naar de amerikaanse joden te gaan maar we besloten toen dat het t beste was om het in israel te laten met de rosh yehudi en dan alle joden naar israel te brengen
5678473 ik zie dit als iets speciaals iets heiligs en het is geweldig
5678474 ik kwam ongeveer een jaar geleden naar tel aviv en sinds toen ben ik bij de rosh yehudi gebleven zij zijn eigenlijk mijn familie hier ik breng bijna elke shabbat met hen door en feestdagen ook
5678475 dit is precies waar ik van droomde jodendom dat is orthodox maar ook elke jood accepteert zoals hij is ze praten in een new age stijl maar torah is torah en de waarheid is waarheid iedereen neemt wat hij wilt gebasseerdop waar hij is het is echt geweldig
5678476 als je al die jeugd ziet springen en dansen tijdens de processie zelfs in de voorbijkomende bussen en op de balkonnen van huizen waarschijnlijk voelen ze dat ze een beetje van het jodendom missen
5678477 het volk van israel houdt van g d houden van de torah en houden van het jodendom en het moment dat zij de kans worden gegeven dan komt hun ware hart naar boven dit is het echte tel aviv
5678478 in de steden van judah zal de stem van blijdschap en vreugde weer gehoord worden
5678479 het hoofd is ziek en het hele hart komt stil te liggen
5678480 mogen soldaten bevelen weigeren om joden uit hun huizen te zetten
5678481 het nog steeds onze verplichting is om te protesteren tegen de openbare rebellie tegen gd
5678482 de linksen dreign van dat als zij klaar zijn met het arabische probleem en vrede hebben gebracht ze af zullen rekenen met de religieuze problemen wat betekend oorlog magen met ons dus zien we dat toen zij deze internationale gruwelijke parade afgelopen zomer wilden houen de oorlog in libanon uitbrak om hen te stoppen en nu weer zij wilden het houden en opeens komt deze gebeurtenis in beth hanoun met de 20 doden dat de politie overlaad met terroristische dreigignen en dan zijn sommigen van hen gewoon simpelweg bang om te paraderen
5678483 in principe hebben we al gewonnen maar we houden alsnog een waardig massaal protest in kiryat moshe voor het geval dat
5678484 misschien zouden we de europese commissie voor de rechtbank moeten slepen

5678496 securing a positive result and putting in a good performance are the most important things
5678497 im happy to be back ive been considered by a new coach the fight for a starting place will be tough so the team will benefit
5678498 some of them play in europe but our goal is to win all our games at home
5678499 on the field it is eleven versus eleven we are all the same and we have a chance to win it
5678500 thats what is making it difficult for dale to choose a starting xi
5678501 weve probably got 16 or 17 guys to choose from
5678502 we are excited to begin the next phase of qualifying
5678503 there are no easy games and we know guatemala are a very difficult team to play at home
5678504 its important to begin the semi final round in a positive way and we are confident that the work we have done in the last 18 months has prepared us for the task
5678505 i feel we are used to each other and weve learnt what they coach wants in training
5678506 we are going in the right direction to play the americans
5678507 this round is going to be tough and for us starting away to cuba will be difficult
5678508 i am not saying we cant get the win but it will not be as easy as people think a world cup qualifier is a different type of game
5678509 i am sure coach kenyon will put a good team on the field

5678517 dont you think bjp would be doing such and such today
5678518 we dont know because we have not reached his pinnacle level of thinking and for sure by you asking that question neither have you and until we do any answer we give is not sufficient and the answers that are being provided by ones that think they have the answer or have changed his protocol to their own answer is nothing but self righteous answers because those individuals have barely even read and understood the process that bjp went through

5678525 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing

5678575 not all hospitals have mortuary facilities but all the hospitals that have the facilities have no right to reject dead bodies and any one caught in the act would be sanctioned appropriately
5678576 there are private mortuaries that are registered you can deposit dead bodies there but they are not authorised under the law to carry out or issue autopsy when it comes to autopsy they have to make use of public facility
5678577 this is because in the past some of the medical staff were giving out autopsy illegally and in the process covered up criminalities
5678578 some medical staff at the ikeja general hospital also engaged in selling body parts to the public hence we need to check this as a responsible government
5678579 wenn die studien erfolgreich verlaufen k nnen wir auf v llig neue therapieans tze zugreifen
5678580 die wenigstens patienten sp ren einen zu hohen bluthochdruck meist erst wenn er extrem hoch ist
5678581 nur etwa ein viertel der patienten ist medikament s gut eingestellt
5678582 bei einem weiteren viertel ist der bluthochdruck diagnostiziert die patienten sind aber nicht ausreichend mit medikamenten versorgt bei einem viertel ist die hypertonie zwar diagnostiziert die patienten werden aber nicht therapiert und schlie lich ist bei einem viertel der betroffenen der bluthochdruck berhaupt nicht diagnostiziert
5678583 bei den meisten hypertonie patienten sind allerdings keine eindeutigen ursachen f r zu hohen blutdruck zu finden
5678584 erstmals wird jetzt das gesamte genom der betroffenen auf ver nderungen untersucht
5678585 wir messen ob im blut freie sauerstoffradikale eiwei e angegriffen haben
5678586 die bei uns gefundenen ergebnisse korrelieren wir schlie lich mit den ergebnissen der genanalyse um so den m glichen hypertonie genen auf die spur zu kommen
5678587 wir implantieren ihn unter das schl sselbein und f hren die aktivierungsdr hte zu beiden halsschlagadern
5678588 das ger t sendet laufend elektroimpulse zu den halsschlagadern dort befinden sich nervenknoten die den blutdruck berwachen
5678589 das gehirn reagiert darauf und setzt k rpereigene mechanismen zur blutdrucksenkung in gang die gef e werden stark erweitert
5678590 bei einer patientin die die therapie mit f nf medikamenten nicht vertragen hatte konnte der blutdruck dauerhaft um 60 bis 70 mmhg verringert werden
5678591 die meisten patienten mit diesen extrem hohen werten m ssen zwar weiterhin medikamente nehmen doch dank der blutdrucksenkung mithilfe des schrittmachers ist die gefahr drastisch gesunken folgekrankheiten zu erleiden
5678592 dabei soll dann gezeigt werden dass die therapie mit dem schrittmacher nicht nur akut wirkt sondern auch chronisch
5678593 wenn die ergebnisse der auf ein jahr angelegten studie positiv sind k nnte der impfstoff bereits in vier jahren auf den markt kommen
5678594 unser ziel ist es mit der impfung medikamente zu ersetzen wir h tten dann eine ganz neue form der behandlung die patienten m ssten nicht regelm ig ihre medikamente einnehmen sondern w ren mit einer einzigen impfung f r einen l ngeren zeitraum gesch tzt
5678595 die wiederum fischen das im blut zirkulierende angiotensin ii weg
5678596 die sch digende wirkung des hormons das engstellen der gef e bleibt aus damit sinkt der blutdruck
5678597 eine blutdrucksenkung von bis zu 20 mmhg konnte nachgewiesen werden allerdings hielt der erfolg nur wenige monate an
5678598 die studienteilnehmer werden innerhalb von zw lf wochen f nfmal geimpft dabei wird die dosis gesteigert und ist am ende dreimal so hoch wie in der ersten studie
5678599 wir wollen eine dauerhaft gute blutdruckeinstellung erreichen ohne das weitere medikamente ben tigt werden

5678643 it is our respectful submission that the judges of the constitutional court in a precipitous media gush on untested claims of gross judicial misconduct failed to heed that imperious urging of a still small voice when it whispered reserve thy judgement

5678727 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor
5678728 transport for london is responsible for a huge range of transport policies that impinge directly on the lives of londoners and i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf

5678767 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
5678768 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
5678769 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
5678770 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5678771 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
5678772 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5678773 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5678774 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

5678785 ive gotten free saturday tickets vouchers for free pit passes etc they will also have driver appearances listed for the week of the race
5678786 it is good to know where you are at all times because you may have come in from the left but they may make you leave to the right you need to know where you are parked in relation to your seats and the interstate that gets you home always look to see where the infield tunnels are because you do not want to be in a lot that has to funnel out in the wrong direction at talladega for example if you are coming from the east and have seats in turn 1 you do not want to get stuck in westbound traffic on the backstretch

5678806 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
5678807 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
5678808 patients with a reduction in gsm levels from their baseline ultrasound to the follow up ultrasound exhibited a significantly increased risk for near future adverse event compared to patients with increasing gsm levels
5678809 this technique will give us additional information to use in selecting patients that need aggressive treatment

5678811 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5678812 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5678813 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5678814 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5678815 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5678816 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5678817 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5678818 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5678829 i even had my telephone shut off a couple times because i couldnt pay the bill
5678830 we used to write each other at least once or twice a week for eight years
5678831 in these letters it was very obvious that he could have no part of the murders and stuff and that i have to believe him basically that he was just at the wrong place at or no it wasnt even that hed say he was completely innocent for eight years i totally and completely believed him
5678832 and the idea of me doing the dishes and my partner watching tv and punks coming in and doing that that changed my mind be different if id seen remorse i guess
5678833 do you have any feelings about how the execution of randy guzek would affect you
5678834 he took two peoples lives away in a horrible and despicable way so yes id be sad because i do love him but thats just normal
5678835 ive probably tried 500 jury trials not all of them for murder of course
5678836 and i can count exactly two cases where someone really just puts the knife in that was one of them
5678837 there wasnt even any discussion they arrived at the decision about death in less than an hour they were out in two hours they reached their decision at 11 30 a m but decided to order lunch
5678838 hey look over here dont look at the blood of rod and lois houser look over here at randy they dont want to talk about the murder of the housers what they want to talk about in the penalty phase is the sad story of randy guzek
5678839 that the first guy to die would take the other guys ashes

5678841 the emotional nuclear bomb that exploded in their lives never goes away the radiation never dissipates the crater never fills up
5678842 lois and rod would have given them the clothes off their back they were that type of people
5678843 the number of times they were shot the reason they were shot the death penalty is never set in concrete but this is one where i felt it was appropriate you take a life and you better expect to give a life
5678844 randy certainly carried out some things joel didnt or couldnt have done
5678845 his brothers didnt go out and shoot people his dad didnt go out and shoot people and these arent just random people he selected to kill these are the aunt and uncle of one of his girlfriends hed been a welcome guest in that house
5678846 randys been convicted of homicide and 18 years later were still on the death penalty phase we should have moved on a long time ago but he keeps coming back it keeps haunting you you keep reliving your moment

5678855 being recognized as a top party school is not a good thing
5678856 our survey clearly shows 75 percent of people support greater enforcement of existing underage drinking laws and increased penalties for adults who give alcohol to those under age
5678857 lowering the drinking age passes this big problem to those in the high school community already dealing with very serious underage drinking issues
5678858 underage drinking is an adult problem and more specifically parents play a key role in educating their children well before peer pressure begins
5678859 we look forward to working with nationwide to help curb this dangerous trend
5678860 the need for strong role models is critical if we are to stop this irresponsible behavior everyone will benefit if we can save lives keep everyone safe and lower the monetary impact of such reckless behavior

5678870 our new mpls network is the centerpiece of inmotions strategic initiative for investing in technology so we can both grow and offer an excellent customer experience
5678871 by managing inmotions private network new edge networks becomes an extension of inmotions it staff
5678872 this frees them to focus on other strategic it activities for supporting a business that spreads across four time zones
5678873 one of the reasons we selected new edge networks is because they seem to better understand the nuances of dealing with airports and their security restrictions

5678879 were doing for metadata what google tm did for web search todays enterprise data explosion has made collecting and refining information time consuming for the architect and hard to understand for the business user
5678880 er studio enterprise portal dramatically simplifies the process for assembling finding and communicating technical metadata at the same time the collaborative tool extends the value of data models across organizations helping businesses better respond to change reuse data across projects and address regulatory compliance issues
5678881 one objective of our data architecture is to document and communicate the context and relationships between data elements so that our it consumers can get their job done

5678883 in phase 2 clinical trials telaprevir based regimens have demonstrated the potential to increase sustained viral response rates across a broad spectrum of patients infected with the hepatitis c virus including patients who failed to achieve svr with previous pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy many of whom are at high risk for life threatening hcv related complications
5678884 the realize trial of telaprevir is a landmark phase 3 trial of an investigational hcv protease inhibitor in null responder and other patients who failed prior treatment and will seek to generate additional data to demonstrate the benefit of telaprevir in this difficult to treat patient population
5678885 approximately 6 million patients are chronically infected with hepatitis c in the u s and e u today and approximately 650 000 of these patients have failed previous treatments of pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy and are in need of a new therapeutic option to treat their disease
5678886 data generated from this phase 3 trial in treatment failure patients as well as data from the ongoing phase 3 advance trial in treatment naive patients may further contribute to the emerging profile of telaprevir to address the significant medical need in both treatment naive and treatment failure patients

5678905 the technology asobo studios has developed to build fuel is ground breaking to create a game on this unprecedented scale to this level of graphical quality complete with all the dynamic weather effects is a great achievement
5678906 fuel had to be a special title for codemasters to include in our racing portfolio and we believe that from both a gameplay and a technical perspective fuel compliments our long standing tradition of driving excellence
5678907 she was a wonderful mother and worked tirelessly to give her children a happy life she was the most caring person i have ever known
5678908 even if she was upset or unhappy she would always think of others first and offer sympathy and support
5678909 she didnt want people to worry about her so she would keep her troubles to herself whilst putting on a brave face for the rest of the world

5678938 gvp is a very important element of our overall strategy
5678939 because it brings to the forefront the convergence of all the technologies that touch customer service along with our cim platform gvp has led the transformation away from silos and point solutions towards a more holistic approach to customer care
5678940 in the present down economy were not seeing companies abandon customer service to focus on cost containment instead were seeing companies invest in technologies that help to lower costs but also improve customer service and personalization either in self assistance live assistance or both
5678941 were seeing an increased investment in newer generation software based ivrs that integrate much more tightly to both customer data in crm software packages as well as to real time contact queuing and routing engines

5678944 todays customer focused enterprises look for technology platform providers who work well with partners and support rapid deployment in multi vendor environments
5678945 genesys successfully knit together the partner friendly attributes of two leading voice platforms and attracted an a list of application developers and integrators

5678951 some who come abuse the situation some people come and all of a sudden it becomes an ebay thing and the people who are here with their youngster who would just love to have a james laurinaitis signature kind of get nudged out of the way by the folks that are trying to use james signature for their own gain
5678952 when things get a little bit abused and out of control you have to control them
5678953 anytime that we have a chance to provide an opportunity for our fans to come in with no cost its as good a deal as it can possibly be
5678954 we hope that some folks who dont necessarily get here all the time because we know how hard it is to get tickets have a chance to come
5678955 she couldnt come up with eight time gold medal winner michael phelps name and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer

5678959 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
5678960 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5678961 they told me there are going to be resources here
5678962 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5678963 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5678964 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5678965 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5678966 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5678967 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5678968 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5678969 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5678970 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
5678971 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5678972 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5678973 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5678974 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5678975 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5678976 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5678977 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5678978 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5678979 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5678980 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5678981 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
5678982 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
5678983 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
5678984 today you can see how we are working together all americans facing the danger of a hurricane striking their home should join us in our efforts
5678985 those of us in government even with the help of our partners in the private and non profit sectors cannot do it alone
5678986 it sells magazines and products does it translate into greater interest and respect in womens sports and the answer is unequivocally it does not
5678987 the assumption is that sex sells the assumption is for womens sports to survive you have to attract the real fans which are male fans and you have to attract them with how pretty they are and how sexy they are
5678988 the development production and stockpiling of bacteriological biological and toxin weapons
5678989 i am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes
5678990 unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the united states
5678991 an impressive military arsenal of aircraft carriers and gun boats
5678992 justification for extending the campaign against international terrorism to iraq washington singled out iraq north korea iran syria and libya of violating the international treaty banning weapons of germ warfare
5678993 confirms that the us has built an extensive arsenal of biological weapons in blatant violation of international laws and covenants
5678994 respected scientists on both sides of the atlantic warned that the us is illegally developing a new generation of weapons that undermine and possibly violate international treaties on biological and chemical warfare
5678995 us armed forces push for offensive biological weapons development genetically engineered microbes that attack items such as fuel plastics and asphalt
5678996 are probably only the tip of the iceberg the national academies are also concealing related documents after the sunshine project requested copies on march 12 2002 they placed a security hold on the public file
5678997 the research proposed by the air force and navy raises serious legal questions under the 1989 us biological weapons anti terrorism act development of biological weapons including those that attack materials is subject to federal criminal and civil penalties
5678998 proposed research for a new fort detrick homeland security center may violate an international ban on biological weapons and encourage other countries to follow
5678999 vast germ warfare laboratory intended to help protect the us against an attack with biological weapons but critics say the laboratorys work will violate international law and its extreme secrecy will exacerbate a biological arms race by accelerat ing work on similar facilities around the world
5679000 heavily guarded and hermetically sealed chambers to produce and stockpile the worlds most lethal bacteria and viruses
5679001 conduct s basic and applied research on biological threats to provide cutting edge medical research for the warfighter against biological threats
5679002 program constitutes clear violations of the international 1972 bwc arms control treaty ratified by the united states in 1975
5679003 parties to this convention are determined to act with a view to achieving effective progress towards general and complete disarmament including the prohibition and elimination of all types of weapons of mass destruction and convinced that the prohibition of the development production and stockpiling of chemical and bacteriological biological weapons and their elimination through effective measures will facilitate the achievement of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control
5679004 repugnant to the conscience of mankind that no effort should be spared to minimize this risk
5679005 acquiring growing modifying storing packaging and dispersing classical emerging and genetically engineered pathogens
5679006 the possibility of a man made disaster either accidental or deliberate for the entire world
5679007 among our many initiatives we are continuing to develop more forward looking analyses to include red teaming efforts to understand new scientific trends that may be exploited by our adversaries to develop biological weapons and to help position intelligence collectors ahead of the problem
5679008 red teaming means that we actually have people out there on a red team plotting planning scheming and conspiring how to use biowarfare
5679009 impossible to distinguish between defensive and offensive research in the field
5679010 scores of us universities and biotechnology companies since 2001 have benefitted handsomely from billions of dollars in biodefense cash across the country biodefense labs are sprouting up like weeds the unrelenting spigot of federal money has thousands of scientists and technicians
5679011 sabotaged the verification protocol for the bwc and fully intend s to engage in research development and testing of illegal and criminal offensive biowarfare programs
5679012 the costliest most grandiose research scheme ever attempted with germ warfare capability going forward under president bush and in defiance of
5679013 germ warfare was an isolated happenstance todays efforts elevate it to an instrument of deadly and loathsome policy
5679014 it is time for the world to change gods hand behind bird flu virus
5679015 a signatory to the biowarfare convention and does not conduct bioweapons research
5679016 outlines how and why the united states government initiated sustained and then dramatically expanded an illegal biological arms buildup
5679017 represent s a significant emerging danger to our population and threaten s international relations among nations
5679018 are always called defensive but with biological weapons defensive and offensive programs overlap almost completely
5679019 boyle also sheds new light on the motives for the 2001 anthrax attacks the media black hole of silence about them and why the fbi may never apprehended the perpetrators of this seminal crime of the 21st century
5679020 a catastrophic biowarfare or bioterrorist incident or accident is a statistical certainty
5679021 misuse of tools technology or knowledge base of bioweapons research for offensive military or terrorist purposes
5679022 if they made it through i can certainly make it through
5679023 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5679024 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5679025 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5679026 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5679027 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5679028 whatever you want to call it luck wasnt on our side
5679029 we came here with full intentions of winning a medal
5679030 the fact were leaving without a medal is really unfortunate
5679031 we put a hell of a lot of work into this year we came a long ways sometimes it just doesnt come together were leaving with no medals a broken collarbone and places that none of us hoped for
5679032 you look at sarah and jennies performances in the world championships and then look at their performances here and the only variable that changed was the stress
5679033 were a young team i think most of us are under 27
5679034 it wouldnt entirely surprise me to see most of the team back in london in four years so were in a little bit of a rebuilding phase but weve got a really strong future ahead of us everyone wants to win medals get those top fives and top 10s but at the end of the day theres always another day
5679035 they are so consistent across the board with all of their disciplines and theyre very hard working
5679036 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5679037 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5679038 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5679039 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5679040 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5679041 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5679042 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5679043 una hora despu s de haber bebido una lata de red bull los sistemas sangu neos del consumidor ya no eran normales eran anormales como lo que esperar amos en un paciente con enfermedad cardiovascular
5679044 el estudio no muestra efectos que ir an m s all que los de beber una taza de caf por ello los resultados eran esperables y est n dentro del rango psicol gico normal
5679045 si uno tiene cualquier predisposici n a enfermedades cardiovasculares lo pensar a dos veces antes de beber
5679046 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5679047 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5679048 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5679049 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5679050 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5679051 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5679052 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5679053 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5679054 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5679055 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5679056 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
5679057 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
5679058 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
5679059 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5679060 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5679061 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5679062 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5679063 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5679064 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5679065 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5679066 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5679067 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5679068 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5679069 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5679070 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5679071 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5679072 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
5679073 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5679074 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5679075 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5679076 loved everything from the salmon and spring rolls to the grilled avocado sandwich everything is fresh and from scratch the owner chef is always
5679077 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
5679078 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5679079 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5679080 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5679081 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5679082 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5679083 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5679084 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5679085 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5679086 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5679087 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5679088 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5679089 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5679090 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5679091 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5679092 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5679093 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5679094 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
5679095 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
5679096 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
5679097 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
5679098 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
5679099 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
5679100 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
5679101 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
5679102 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
5679103 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
5679104 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5679105 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5679106 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5679107 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5679108 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
5679109 10 6 gw the generation capacity of the six plants x 7884 hours of generation per year assuming 90 operational 83 57 twh y 83 57 twh y x 0 65 54 mt co2 y
5679110 do you want to puke are you sure are you sure you dont want to puke
5679111 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5679112 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5679113 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5679114 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5679115 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5679116 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5679117 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5679118 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5679119 just so you all know we did set a record
5679120 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5679121 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5679122 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5679123 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5679124 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5679125 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5679126 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5679127 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5679128 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5679129 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5679130 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5679131 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5679132 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5679133 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5679134 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5679135 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
5679136 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
5679137 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
5679138 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
5679139 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5679140 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5679141 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5679142 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5679143 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5679144 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5679145 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5679146 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5679147 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5679148 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5679149 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5679150 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5679151 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5679152 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5679153 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5679154 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5679155 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5679156 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5679157 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5679158 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5679159 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5679160 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5679161 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
5679162 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
5679163 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5679164 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5679165 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5679166 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well

5679169 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers

5679174 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5679175 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5679176 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you

5679181 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5679182 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it
5679183 the drive began in july and by the end of the month a total of 2600 was collected this money was sufficient to dig a bore well as well as fit an electric pump
5679184 i want to build rural maharashtra i want medical attention to be available to everyone and make physicians available in every village in rural maharashtra
5679185 so officer numnuts i see here in the records that during the last six months on your beat youve made quite a number of arrests
5679186 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5679187 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
5679188 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
5679189 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war

5679193 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5679194 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5679195 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5679196 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5679197 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5679198 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5679199 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5679200 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5679201 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5679202 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5679203 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5679204 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5679205 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5679206 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5679207 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5679208 i knew what i was supposed to do and i did it for you
5679209 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5679210 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5679211 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5679212 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5679213 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

5679244 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5679245 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5679246 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5679247 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable

5679260 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5679261 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5679262 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5679263 all the managers could see was a threat this online business would drain their budgets and take audiences and staffing away from the main shows
5679264 all the online targets part of the main business proposition all the online people were placed at desks alongside their broadcast colleagues
5679265 from a broadcast and online strategy to simply having a media strategy
5679266 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5679267 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5679268 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5679269 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5679270 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5679271 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5679272 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature

5679278 the real weakness of his as i see it is that he has never realized the importance of institutions
5679279 he just leaves all the institutions of pakistan so weak including the political ones who are to now run the affairs of the country
5679280 onward his standing was on shaky grounds and the power began to slip away from him
5679281 musharraf was a hotheaded and impulsive political leader from day 1 to the end
5679282 this was very unfortunate that he always put his personal ambitions ahead of the interests of the people of pakistan
5679283 for the last years he has been ruling the country and hes been no good to it
5679284 so i think it is better that he has resigned and its over now

5679291 another new character is a hacker named roland our team has learned to have some level of trust among each other or at least they know everyone elses agenda but this is a new guy theyre forced to work with and theyre not sure how they feel about him but they need his expertise in the technological stuff that our guys dont necessarily have
5679292 origin has developed a leading position in coal seam gas in australia and the strength of this position will be a key driver for continuing growth
5679293 origin has outstanding prospects as a strongly performing australian integrated energy company with increasing exposure to growing demand and higher prices for australias natural resources
5679294 directors believe it is in shareholders best interests to reject bgs bid
5679295 whilst equity markets and energy prices decline and coal seam gas companies share prices fall origin is telling its shareholders to wait for an uncertain and unclear outcome from its monetisation process and reject the certain value of bg groups a 15 50 all cash offer
5679296 theres a sense that origin has gotten quite a positive response on its coal seam gas monetisation process but thats still in early days so its hard to decide which is a better option
5679297 its difficult to say what bg might do theres a high chance they will wait until they get more details of the coal seam gas monetisation proposals origin has received but they could also make a pre emptive strike and launch a higher offer
5679298 we have already made many improvements to mobileme but we still have many more to make we are working very hard to make mobileme a great service we can all be proud of we know that mobilemes launch has not been our finest hour and we truly appreciate your patience as we turn this around

5679357 not only does the f5 solution meet our acceleration needs but it does so without any additional overhead webaccelerator has been running for over a year with no downtime or performance issues its been our magic bullet that solved all latency and speed issues in one fell swoop
5679358 with webaccelerator service oriented organizations like averitt can overcome performance issues and provide virtually instant access to the dynamic web applications their users and their business depend on in addition webaccelerator enables companies to scale acceleration technology to meet their needs as it can be deployed as a single device in the data center or expanded to a symmetric deployment for added performance gains at remote locations

5679374 what a great world it would be to live in
5679375 if that was the case we certainly rose to the challenge pretty well
5679376 we are going to be a target for people this season no doubt about that
5679377 but you have got to be able to deal with that and the only thing missing on saturday was converting a couple of chances
5679378 but give the opposition some credit for their good defending

5679382 in football there are times when things dont go well
5679383 sometimes you hold your hands up and say youve been outfought or that the opposition did something tactically that we couldnt cope with or that they were technically better but i dont think it was down to any of that
5679384 i just dont think we had any players who were at it but ive got to be thinking that it was a bit of a freak ive got to look at it like that
5679385 this was a sickening attack on a vulnerable elderly man and we are appealing to the public to help bring the two men responsible to justice

5679390 there are public fields behind the church where they gather to take turns hitting the balls its a very high roof and i think that is what attracts them
5679391 im obviously upset and i hope that they dont realise the damage they are doing it would be much worse if they were aware of it that would make it even more unacceptable
5679392 the church is a vital part of the village and the hall is used by everyone from youth groups to old folks dinners its a slap in the face for the community who deserve better
5679393 theyve got me over a barrel because im supposed to forgive and turn the other cheek but its very hard we want to bring home to people that its their neighbours lining up and targeting their property its so discouraging and disheartening to think it is people from rosewell who are doing this
5679394 i am aware this is an ongoing problem in rosewell and have asked community officer rod stewart to liaise with the informant and to look into the matter

5679415 john mccains leave no millionaire behind economic agenda may make sense to phil gramm but the 101 million households that will get nothing under the mccain tax plan understand how out of touch he is when it comes to the economic challenges facing americas families
5679416 since john mccain thinks only people making more than 5 million are rich it is no wonder his tax plan would hand hundreds of thousands of dollars in new tax giveaways to millionaires or that his potential treasury secretary thinks our country is a nation of whiners
5679417 if youre just talking about income how about five million
5679418 i dont want to take any money from the rich
5679419 weve sort of become a nation of whiners and yet you just here this constant whining and complaining

5679444 underage and binge drinking is a tough problem and we welcome an honest discussion about how to address this challenge but that discussion must honor the science behind the 21 law which unequivocally shows that the 21 law has reduced drunk driving and underage and binge drinking
5679445 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
5679446 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies
5679447 as a three time university president i can tell you that losing a student to an alcohol related tragedy is one of the hardest and most heart rending experiences imaginable
5679448 signing this initiative does serious harm to the education and enforcement efforts on our campuses and ultimately endangers young lives even more i ask every higher education leader who has signed to reconsider i am old enough to remember life on our campuses before the 21 year drinking rule it was horrible
5679449 the traffic safety and public health benefits of the 21 minimum drinking age law have been well established with the department of transportation estimating nearly 1 000 lives saved each year as a result i strongly support this lifesaving law and will not consider any effort to repeal or weaken it in any way
5679450 drunk driving needlessly kills thousands of young people every year thats why i wrote a law to create a national drinking age of 21 and why we fight so hard to reduce drunk driving and save lives on our roads
5679451 this small minority of college administrators wants to undo years of success that defies common sense we need to do all we can to protect the national drinking age a law that saves the lives of drivers passengers and pedestrians across the country each year
5679452 countless lives have been saved since congress raised the national minimum drinking age to 21 in 1984 we need to maintain this important law and the life saving protection it gives our teens and others on the roads
5679453 age 21 drinking laws are effective in preventing deaths and injuries
5679454 repealing them is a terrible idea it would be a national tragedy to turn back the clock and jeopardize the lives of more teens
5679455 this initiative aims to lower the drinking age without proposing a realistic substitute it reflects ignorance about the years of research comprising the scientific justification for 21 laws sound policy should be based on sound science what is the evidence that education programs would be an effective replacement for minimum drinking age laws there is none if states lower the drinking age again more teens will drink and drive and more will die
5679456 while advocates argue a lower drinking age will curb teen binge drinking our survey shows only 14 percent of americans agree and 47 percent believe it will actually make a huge problem worse
5679457 americans feel so strongly about teen binge drinking more than half say they are less likely to vote for a politician who supports lowering the legal limit or to send their child to a known
5679458 by signing onto this initiative these presidents have made the 21 law nearly unenforceable on their campuses in fact i call into question whether or not these campuses are bothering to enforce the 21 drinking age
5679459 it does not make sense to increase access to alcohol when there are already so many problems with underage drinking as it stands about 5 000 people under age 21 die each year due to underage drinking 6 this is not to mention the sexual assaults violence and injuries
5679460 since teliks development focus does not include metabolic diseases like diabetes we have sought a licensee for this program

5679590 this summers forecast and unusual early melting events all around the arctic serve as a dire warning of how quickly the polar regions are being affected by climate change
5679591 if norways average temperature this year equals that in 2007 the ice cap in the arctic will all melt away which is highly possible judging from current conditions
5679592 the arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by nsidc and the norwegian polar year secretariat it didnt even come close additionally some current graphs and press releases from nsidc seem less than conservative there appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to arctic ice loss

5679656 were currently carrying out enquiries into how this crash happened gathering evidence from the scene and speaking to witnesses this is likely to take some time given the nature of the incident and the diverse background of those involved
5679657 heard a massive crash rumble of either crunching metal or what sounded to me initially as a thunderstorm as it was heavily raining before

5679688 an equilibrium is always upheld through which everybody gets what he needs
5679689 for example the two tourists fondling each other near the stage they will have passionate sex in their hotel room tonight theyll think its because they got so much excitement out of being on bourbon street but actually itll be because they decided ahead of time that they would find bourbon street exciting theyll live the mythology because since they decided ahead of time what it would be like it was going to be like that whether it really was or not like a self fulfilling prophesy
5679690 i mean i agree with your theory the mythology is the antitheses of the reality but its so obvious that everybody who comes here notices that right away its a perfect scam a big bad joke nobodys going to get what they want they will all get exactly what they dont want they dont know what the other people in the room will be like and knowing this they will haphazardly decide what what they want is going to look like the thing is when what they want comes along theyll pass it up because it doesnt look like what they decided it would look like see itll be what they want instead of looking like what they want

5679698 jade had some tests recently then she went off to india to appear in the indian big brother
5679699 yesterday we got a call from her consultant to say she had cancer of the cervix and so she has to come back straight away
5679700 we put the consultant in touch with the programme maker in india and because of the circumstances was allowed to speak to her and explain the results of her tests
5679701 the important thing is to get her back as soon as possible and get this treated
5679702 obviously there were some problems thats why she had tests but she had no idea that would be the diagnosis she was shocked
5679703 it is unbelievable how life is so unpredictable and finds a way to distract and derail you from your plans
5679704 my prayers are with jade her family in this hour when they face one of the biggest tests of their life in times ahead
5679705 i pray she comes out of this soon and stronger with happy memories from this country

5679718 the intent was to put an end to all the geoengineering talk
5679719 melting of greenland and antarctic ice caps and the consequent sea level rise
5679720 the very best would be if emissions of the greenhouse gases could be reduced so much that the stratospheric sulfur release experiment would not take place
5679721 people have this fantasy right now that maybe this will save us
5679722 but it looks like its going to cause more problems than it will solve
5679723 im actually more concerned about the effect of geoengineering on the social and political systems than on the climate system

5679847 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5679848 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5679849 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles

5679854 under the proposal the amount that would be required to be disclosed is the claim amount or if there is no claim amount the companys best estimate of its maximum exposure to loss
5679855 it is because of the strong and extensive input weve received from investors who want greater transparency relating to a wide range of contingencies including litigation that we are proposing these expanded disclosures the new disclosures are aimed at providing information earlier to existing and potential investors in order to give them a greater understanding of the risks companies are facing we believe that information would improve their ability to make informed investment decisions

5679870 in the minds of most people you rarely spend money to get nothing done
5679871 but in government people often spend vast sums of money to make sure nothing happens at all
5679872 you put the dysfunctionality and the sharp partisan issues together and the failure to get a bill is easy to describe
5679873 but to say nothings happened because of this money i dont agree with that
5679874 maybe they know who their friends are and they have other means of influencing them
5679875 people have absorbed the fact that its a real crisis and it will take complicated solutions to solve
5679876 they invest in people and they like to invest in people that will be around forever
5679877 theres been a small number of truly appalling situations but in the most part people dont hate disabled people
5679878 disabled people are often the victims we are vulnerable and perhaps remind people of their own inadequacies it makes them feel better to put us down
5679879 christine might as well have had a target on her head saying attack me victimise me
5679880 when she was challenged she wouldnt walk away they would think she was probably comical because she would stamp her feet shout back at them pull a funny face and burst into tears
5679881 i think for the vast majority of disabled people bullying is the problem its things like folks with learning difficulties being harassed on the housing estate where they live or children in school being picked on
5679882 in some very rare cases this low level bullying and harassment turns into fully fledged hate crime
5679883 out of forty people in the room i saw probably two thirds of them nod even i was shocked by that and ive worked on disability hate crime
5679884 if you look at the whole experience of hate crime and at the extreme end of that of murder it starts with calling someone a name because they are different
5679885 its a hatred or a fear of difference while some of the small incidents in themselves dont amount to much the cumulative effect on disabled people is enormous
5679886 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole

5679896 im just gonna say a lot of big records i was on a good portion of those records or asked to be on a good portion of those records that lil wayne was on along with him not like they asked me before they asked him or vice versa i know i was on a good portion of those records cause the i cant feel my face thing we were pushing that hard people wanted to get both of us i couldnt go as far as the clearances i could do my verse then it got to the point where i couldnt go there with people because i didnt want them to think that it was me being the bad guy not clearing stuff i didnt want that on my name so i would let people know i cant really if you wanna just put it out on the mixtapes we could do that all day the fans definitely missed out on a lot of juelz due to my contract
5679897 i tell people i couldnt do business with him but i will say he gave me the biggest chance i needed im a dude from the hood so the chance he gave me is a chance i needed to never turn back im good my artistry my talent my career was never built on controversy so i would never come out and say a whole bunch of things that could be said all i can say is im sorry he cant be here to be a part of whats about to happen because were about to tear em up

5679900 its no hard feelings and now that im out of my situation i dont mind putting a diplomat album together
5679901 at first people kinda looked at us like damn whats going on
5679902 they looking at us like were disloyal but as the time went by its kinda like what we gonna do just die out because the dude that was supposed to be the boss and the head of the table decided to disappear that means we would have vanished along with that we from harlem baby we hustlers were gonna stay afloat were not even floating right now were surfing we not even surfing im the ocean
