2910037 it took the ambulance an hour to get to the grounds and by the time it arrived we just wanted them to treat keith
2910038 we asked what had taken it so long but we got no answer we dont even know where the ambulance came from whether it was from
2910039 even today we were asking around and we still dont know it couldnt have had anything to do with the weather as it wasnt even raining around here it is all very odd
2910040 it is a good service usually they should be able to respond to an emergency in aughrim in 15 20 minutes
2910041 i believe there are two ambulances based in arklow so it is a bit surprising
2910042 thats a 24 hour service and wicklow town also has ambulances
2910043 im very disappointed to hear about that incident and we will have to investigate more into it to see where the problem was

2910048 the state government should set an aim of stabilising the population and adopt a cap of half a million
2910049 political leaders need to recognise that continuous population growth is unsustainable
2910050 its a fallacy that population growth is necessary for economic growth
2910051 china is the worlds most dynamic economy yet it has a one child policy
2910052 europe has a much lower population growth rate than the united states but its economies are performing much better
2910053 east timor has the worlds highest birth rate but is the worlds poorest country
2910054 we must work out what our total sustainable carrying capacity is and start working to that
2910055 if we dont we cant plan properly for infrastructure or determine what services and infrastructure well need to provide
2910056 our population is nowhere near where it needs to be to be economically self sustaining

2910068 i left teaching because i realized that before i got a little older than what i am 25 if i was going to make this
2910069 i dont think enough was made of the fact that we are very serious laggards in terms of police officers doing duties which have long since been handed over to civilians in other jurisdictions
2910070 trying to portray the situation in a way that is some distance from reality
2910071 as far as civilianisation numbers are concerned we are some way behind the european average and have been extremely slow to embrace international best practice
2910072 the comments in the email refer to the historical situation and are not in relation to the current civilianisation programme under way
2910073 it is no secret that ireland has been behind other jurisdictions in terms of civilianisation
2910074 but both the minister and the department are completely satisfied in relation to the progress to date any fine gael comments to the contrary are completely wide of the mark

2910089 some of the mystery surrounding the devil and exorcism is being unveiled in a television and internet report series detailing the work of the exorcist of the diocese of rome
2910090 i go to one of romes churches to a parish that is closed during the day
2910091 there is mass in the morning and then the church is closed there i perform the difficult exorcisms i always work with seven to 10 people who help me and use a small bed sometimes we need to tie people down or simply subdue them

2910099 what counted was creation according to robbe grillet a novel or a film should show imagination at work it should create a mental world not to be confused with the real world a portrait of society that was related to reality that sought to represent real life was the preoccupation only of traditional novelists when robbe grillet described a seagull in his novels he never sought to verify his portrait by looking at a real seagull his imagined seagull had the quality of art realism was sterile the real should be kept at a distance and the artist be freed of it

2910130 we took some more time to declare the team because of injury problems mushfiqur who hardly had any problem while keeping and batting looked uncomfortable when throwing the ball
2910131 we have recalled dhiman ghosh after his impressive performance in england with the bangladesh a team
2910132 nazimuddin had his chances but he was not up to the mark mehrab hossain jnr looked impressive against the new ball and thats why we considered him as the third opener shahriar nafees kept his place as well due to his good record and previous performances against australia
2910133 my opinion is that we fought against the top ranked sides in the last two tournaments and there were signs of improvement in our performances we want to play good cricket and challenge the worlds best team

2910154 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
2910155 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
2910156 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle

2910178 the military conflict in georgia is the key factor in pushing up oil prices this morning so much has happened so quickly since we first heard of russias attack last week

2910183 contrary to popular belief we can find no evidence that private schools actually increase student performance

2910188 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2910189 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2910190 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2910191 this is a big economic relationship its pretty open but we can make it more open
2910192 remember when it comes to sale of education services the sale of these technology products and investment in the economy like this is very important for australia
2910193 we intend to make lets call it a modest first step
2910194 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2910195 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2910200 we believe we are entering the next phase of the internet as growth and productivity will center on collaboration enabled by networked web 2 0 technologies
2910201 we have project teams working on a global basis and to help them collaborate effectively we use google apps
2910202 the spectacular growth of sharepoint is the result of the great combination of collaboration and information management capabilities it delivers
2910203 i believe that the success weve seen so far is just the beginning for sharepoint
2910204 this things going to crest a half a billion soon who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time
2910205 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2910206 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2910207 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2910208 yang saya mau mencium kamu kira kira gimana boleh gak
2910209 it just seemed like a good time to do it
2910210 the comets are off with the olympics break school is about to start so we wanted to give kids and fans a chance to come out and play some ball watch some of their idols and just have a good time
2910211 this is a great area for basketball and its a great sport for our kids to be involved in plus its nice to be back around these players i am friends with and respect so much
2910212 these are the women that paved the way for me
2910213 looking on this court seeing nykesha sales and cynthia cooper i am just so grateful for what they did for the sport
2910214 when we were young we didnt know we would ever be able to play professionally
2910215 now young girls everywhere can have that dream its really special to be a part of that
2910216 i am so lucky that i got to grow up with goals to play basketball that i got to really put my all into it and work hard knowing that my dream was actually possible
2910217 i get to see them this weekend doing what they can to help out the sport and i got to play on the same court with some of them before so i think this is just a really cool event
2910218 i think they are doing a really good thing giving their time like this and raising money it makes me proud to be a basketball player and i hope i can contribute like this in my career too
2910219 we can do a lot for our community and for the youth of the area
2910220 the muslim religion is not on trial here ladies and gentlemen
2910221 conversion to islam art 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini amp shamala revisited
2910222 is this an admission that umno had plotted for the extreme reaction to the bar council forum on religious conversions in kuala lumpur on saturday
2910223 i have been informed that disciplinary action would be taken against him the pakatan rakyat leadership will have to address the pakatan rakyat disarray over this issue
2910224 dap is also disappointed that deputy prime minister datuk seri najib razaks irresponsible remarks in condoning extreme hooligan and rowdy behaviour that disrupted a forum held by the bar council and threats of using the internal security act against the bar council is a desperate attempt to revive the waning political fortunes of barisan nasional
2910225 now that bn can no longer respond to charges of corruption mismanagement abuse of power and waste they are playing with fire by using religion to frighten the people
2910226 for a future prime minister to defend such extreme and rowdy behaviour is a genuine cause of concern for malaysias future as a harmonious and peaceful multi racial society that guarantees freedom of religion
2910227 it is regrettable that some members of political parties such as pas pkr and umno were involved in the almost violent demonstration
2910228 such issues and procedures if left unresolved without good mutual understanding will continue to haunt the multi religious society of malaysia
2910229 he hoped that the bar council got the message that there are certain things that are out of bounds for public discussion even if held in a private place
2910230 four members of hindraf were arrested for creating an awareness of their cause in the recent commonwealth parliamentary association conference on aug 7 but here you have over 300 protesters behaving aggressively carrying inciting banners and storming into the bar council forum raising uncalled racial sentiments against fellow malaysians without fear and protected by the police
2910231 the statement by home minister appear to be condoning such violent behavior and supporting hooliganism and claims he has not received any complaints of threat to national security or disturbance to public order is utter rubbish and nonsensical
2910232 police sealed my house at nigeen as well as mirwaiz manzil at rajouri kadal where a meeting of coordination committee was going on regarding muzaffarabad challo programme
2910233 we will continue to support the agitation as long as it takes to get our demand for the restoration of land to shri amarnath shrine board fulfilled
2910234 let it take any amount of time we will continue our stir till something positive emerges
2910235 we committed too many mistakes in defence and made life unnecessarily difficult for ourselves i think we didnt take it seriously enough after getting the early lead and we were punished for it
2910236 but were through to the next round and thats what counts it was good to find out where we stand after five intense weeks of training although our euro 2008 players arent up to speed yet
2910237 we can draw a lot of minor conclusions from the match and well deal with them in training over the coming week
2910238 we knew erfurt would rise above themselves but i didnt expect us to stand aside and let them shoot at goal the way we did our players may have subconsciously believed wed have an easy ride especially when it came to defending
2910239 dont make great stuff in a nice sweater and drinking a martini
2910240 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
2910241 with pay pressure still subdued mounting job insecurity is being compounded by a significant squeeze on workers real incomes but the absence of any sign of an emerging wage price spiral at least offers greater hope that the bank of england might soon be able to cut interest rates to head off the threat of recession
2910242 companies are now reacting to deteriorating market conditions with sales slowing and input costs rising but scope to raise prices limited by weakening demand finances are under pressure
2910243 it looks as if employment costs the main area over which businesses retain control are taking the strain with employers seeking both to keep a lid on pay settlements and in increasing numbers planning for redundancies the labour market is suddenly looking a lot less resilient
2910244 when you take into account travel food drink and entertainment the cost of a saturday night out can soon add up
2910245 oh man of little faith you couldnt even walk out on the water and come to me where is your trust
2910246 do we take this very seriously and try to learn from it yes but were not panicked
2910247 this shows us were a volume driven business and we have to be prepared for some slow months
2910248 our costs last month were where we wanted them to be but we didnt make as much money per admission because patients didnt require the higher intensity of care
2910249 the whole health care industry is going through financial issues with payments decreasing from insurance companies and government sources
2910250 as long as we see that downward trend i think weve got some things to be concerned about
2910251 our goal is never to make 100 million a year but to deliver the highestquality health care and the highest value to the community and be good stewards of our resources
2910252 theres no doubt we could make more money if we chose to see certain kinds of patients but then we wouldnt be a value to the community
2910253 it is time to tighten the bail laws and put public safety first

2910289 we have seen the long queues of voters eagerly waiting for their turn to vote using the electronic voting machines
2910290 we are so heartened about the initial positive voting turn out with the new technology the people of maguindanao are more motivated vote than ever before
2910291 we have deployed back up machines to serve as contingency in case any of the machines bog down

2910299 this is a disruptive element with the potential to bring cargo costs down by at least 60 percent and 40 percent of a roses cost is freight
2910300 it is far more disruptive than just cost it will lead to a big increase in consumer demand and it means growers will have to extend the product life by four weeks
2910301 the cost supply spikes associated with christmas valentines day mothers day chinese new year and russian mothers day could be a thing of the past
2910302 it sea freight has been baby steps so far but now its reaching traction
2910303 in terms of size kenya is bigger now about 150 hectares under greenhouse but ethiopia is being ramped up and by december this year will be bigger than kenya
2910304 we have been seriously looking at ecuador we want to offer a better product portfolio and de risk our business model essentially it is a northern hemisphere southern hemisphere arbitrage play it is good to broaden the base of our production
2910305 five years from now i hope that roses will only be 25 to 30 percent of our company karuturi global ltd revenue
2910306 that is the sort of scale you could once only think of getting in argentina brazil or australia i couldnt get that much land in india but we have obtained the land in ethiopia on long term 50 year lease
2910307 weve bought the farm equipment and lined up agricultural experts from the u s and latin america to guide us in large scale farming we will be in production by february 2009 opening 10 000 hectares in the first quarter and then adding 10 000 hectares a month after that
2910308 this year for valentines day we were embarrassed by the demand
2910309 in fact it was crazy we had too many orders we had to stagger our deliveries from february 14 to 17 in 2009 well be delivering all through the week not just on february 14
2910310 i think the georgian issue is helping the market to focus back on the supply side that has really changed the market quite a bit
2910311 the task of the russian forces at present is to ensure control of south ossetia the pipelines would be in danger only if the war escalated
2910312 the test of the athlete revealed that she had tested positive for epo
2910313 moreno left china the evening of the test before she knew of the results
2910314 her accreditation has been cancelled and withdrawn by the ioc we have asked the sports governing body the international cycling union uci to follow it up as any disciplinary measures will be complete after the games finish
2910315 unbelievable jason finished that race way better than we could have even asked for
2910316 for that last 50 i was thinking this is going to be one close race
2910317 the last 10 to 15 metres were incredible i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional after that
2910318 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
2910319 i like the fact no other european has won two majors consecutively
2910320 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
2910321 once i got to the weekend and made a few putts it was a question of adrenaline keeping me going
2910322 you just have to give it a go from my experience in majors i know that nobody goes without making mistakes
2910323 i knew i would get my opportunity and it was going to be my day i took that opportunity
2910324 when i started making putts i just stuck in there and it brought my game up the more i got into it the better i played
2910325 i had to convince myself not to get into this sentimental thinking that maybe it is his turn
2910326 i had to convince myself that it is going to be my day i deserve to win three majors you have to be very selfish in this situation when you are on the golf course
2910327 it was evident at carnoustie when i won i was so focused on what i was doing and the high of it and then i turned around i saw sergio and i could see the disappointment and that there was a loser that day
2910328 when i got up to the green i had no idea which was which
2910329 im 10 feet and sergio is four feet i knew i had the opportunity to get the putt in first that was important i knew if i holed this i would probably win the pga if i missed sergio would probably win the pga it was down to that
2910330 i hit a lovely putt read it exactly and it did exactly what i wanted
2910331 i feel like i played well enough to win but it didnt happen thats pretty much all i can ask of myself
2910332 every time you are out there trying to win a major there can only be one winner
2910333 i didnt go in planning to break the world record im very excited it was a great swim she said
2910334 its kind of weird because when you are little you dream of being famous its weird to become that person you dont expect it to happen to you
2910335 the inseparable connection established by god which man on his own initiative may not break between the unitive significance and the procreative significance which are both inherent to the marriage act
2910336 if therefore there are well grounded reasons for spacing births arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife or from external circumstances the church teaches that married people may then take advantage of the natural cycles immanent in the reproductive system and engage in marital intercourse only during those times that are infertile thus controlling birth in a way which does not in the least offend the moral principles which we have just explained
2910337 with regard to physical economic psychological and social conditions responsible parenthood is exercised by those who prudently and generously decide to have more children and by those who for serious reasons and with due respect to moral precepts decide not to have additional children for either a certain or an indefinite period of time
2910338 the concept of gender identity was fashioned by radical homosexual groups and advocates to protect the bizarre sexual behavior of a few people in practical effect these types of ordinances end up being used to intimidate and prosecute christians and anyone else who raises objections to this form of deviant behavior
2910339 the high number of petitions signed by the citizens of gainesville serves as an indicator of the power held by citizens over elected officials who choose to push a far left national agenda
2910340 people who would kill their sisters or daughters for bringing shame on the family would do anything to avoid being labeled a debtor

2910347 but if i box properly i could get to the finals i know i can i feel it
2910348 if they are in my top 10 of boxing wisdom then i might be more concerned

2910353 i tell flavio what exactly is happening in training how the games go hes fine and perfectly supportive we speak two or three times a week well have a conversation about how he thinks the game is played he understands how to build teams
2910354 i think it went to my head and i was already thinking about my celebration
2910355 ive been practising all week and didnt miss one the new owners do come to the training quite a lot and we know them on first name terms theyre just like friends and they seem to know everything about football flavio asked me what i was doing taking the penalty afterwards he was just having a joke i think
2910356 im aware of the history and about a big future they want to achieve things
2910357 the owners seem to know everything about football flavio asked why i was taking the penalty
2910358 they play a languid laid back style this is more harum scarum
2910359 hes got some talent the boy hes one who will gets the bums off seats but hes also capable of taking some heavy challenges
2910360 credit to barnsley it was like two heavyweight boxers slugging it out and we had to grind it out today

2910370 he was an animal he had the best day of anybody he played football like football should be played with vicious violent controlled effort i was really happy with laupepa i think he found himself thats a key position kia and laupepa are competing for that spot laupepa took a step up in going after it
2910371 i feel im getting stronger im powering off of it more than i was im hopeful
2910372 we dont care if its a big back as long as he can block thats the most important thing id rather play the best running backs
2910373 he was on our scout team we like him as a running back hes been getting reps with the first and second teams
2910374 lacount said he will correct the deficiencies and be ready to compete in the spring semester lacount has not used a redshirt year he still has two seasons of eligibility lacount is 6 feet 7 and 290 pounds he signed with oregon state as a kailua high school senior but ended up going to college of the canyons

2910385 it seems overwhelming but im blessed that i have a coach who understands that im trying to get my degree and i respect him for letting me have that opportunity to go to school and come out when i could its kind of good its a good thing to stay focused
2910386 summer school ends on thursday giving dowling about a week and a half to concentrate solely on football before the start of the fall semester on aug 25 although his class schedule kept him out of two practices last week dowling is a front runner for a starting cornerback spot as he looks to make the most of his lone season in manoa
2910387 thats different as far as the material aspect i really dont care about the material its all football and school
2910388 i stayed here in the summer so i learned everything so im more comfortable out there than in the spring

2910442 insting apa maksud paman berkat tuhan kenapa tuhan bisa memilih paman untuk diberkati
2910443 begini pertama tama jujur paman akui bahwa pamanmu ini memang tidak berpendidikan formal tetapi bukan tidak terdidik justru karena pendidikan paman rendah paman memulai segala sesuatu melalui jalur trial and error dan jika dihitung dengan uang pendidikan yang paman tempuh biayanya sungguh sangat besar sama dengan biaya di sekolah formal malahan bisa bisa lebih mahal orang tahunya paman yang sukses hari ini orang mungkin tidak pernah tahu berapa kali paman jatuh bangun mendirikan bisnis ini pengalaman mengajarkan tidak peduli berapa kali kita jatuh pastikan bangun lagi akhirnya paman pun berhasil menguasai know how bisnis dengan baik dan setelah paman berhasil menanamkan fondasi dan mulai merangkak naik juga tidak lantas berpuas diri ingat semakin tinggi pijakan kita angin pun semakin kencang dan selalu berubah arah maka di dunia usaha yang terus berubah kita harus pandai pandai belajar membaca arah dan perubahan angin setelah itu barulah mengatur bagaimana manajemen yang baik dan mendelegasikan pekerjaan melalui anak anak muda yang berpendidikan tinggi seperti kamu

2910449 it was perfect its a dream come true one of the things i have always been aware of as an athlete is that you can be a world champion but one day you become an ex world champion when you are an olympic champion you are an olympic champion for life
2910450 so many emotions all came out at once you have taken your body to the absolute limits and there is just such an outpouring of emotion when you cross the line
2910451 my target is always to spend the right money on the right player therefore the timing of your buy is also important as well
2910452 no it is nothing to do with that we have nasri and tomas rosicky who were not in amsterdam we have plenty of players
2910453 it is not necessarily the swiss boy though i cannot tell you more about him than anybody else
2910454 to win big trophies makes you more confident and gives you something you can pass on to the team around you
2910455 at 21 he already has a lot of experience he is an intelligent boy but i would not like to put too much pressure on him cesc in midfield is the player who has maybe more experience than the others now we are a body short but it is not necessarily to play alongside cesc he can play alongside anybody you see now at the moment song not being here diaby out rosicky and nasri not here we are a fraction short
2910456 diaby will not be available for the start of the season so we will have to work on some things i think diaby will be out for about a month it is his thigh
2910457 i cant answer it because ive not got a direct answer
2910458 its been pressing since the end of last season we always look to operate with four strikers
2910459 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position over gareth barry
2910460 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2910461 it is the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool think the price is too high
2910462 well bring in one more player if we can i do not know when but clearly we have problems on the left harry kewell has gone fabio aurelio is injured and sebastian leto cannot get a work permit
2910463 who comes in it could be a left sided player rather than a central midfielder he can play in three different positions that is a positive thing im talking about one player but i wont say the name

2910511 young linebackers can have a tendency to see things and go for it maybe trying to do something that isnt their responsibility but he stayed behind the play and when rice came back in his direction he stepped up and made the play
2910512 he was patient and took care of his responsibility of having his gap covered he also played great technique keeping his shoulders square throughout the play and then made a nice tackle
2910513 the thing that stood out to me was that he got good depth in his drop because sometimes young players coming out of college are not used to taking as deep drops as they have to in the pros
2910514 but he got himself in the right position and made a real nice play when it came to him i have to think he must be pretty happy with the way he played
2910515 i thought he played the best out of all of them
2910516 he was around the ball all night you can see him improving and thats going to be important for the patriots because through the course of the year you need seven eight linebackers to play
2910517 obviously i have to be healthy enough to get in there and perform at a high level and right now im not ready
2910518 if there is a situation that comes up i will definitely look at it but it has to be something with the pats
2910519 there is no sense in me going to another locker room when i have my guys in that locker room that are going back and hopefully trying to finish what we started
2910520 obviously their blocking was good but there were mistakes we made
2910521 whether its containing the ball or whatever it is just missing tackles they outexecuted us on that play
2910522 we didnt play physical enough we didnt tackle well we didnt do anything well in the kicking game and it definitely hurt our team so were going to have to get better
2910523 we just didnt make the plays they played better than we did
2910524 i think we had five turnovers and yet were still in the game so maybe were onto something good i dont know yet this film is going to tell us a lot coach belichick is going to tell us a lot
2910525 they won that area of football i can tell you that weve got to get better and i can tell you that too

2910572 i am very shocked i cannot see if we should live in this area any more
2910573 as chinese students we do not have any affairs with other people
2910574 we are far away from home and we live in a strange area
2910575 will likely require aggressive drug regimens and rely on the timing of initiating therapy
2910576 studies need to be done in the next few years to determine if very aggressive therapy early on will allow us to get a functional cure
2910577 we have to make sure the drug development remains in step with the evolution of the virus and that industry continues to invest
2910578 worrying signs that that isnt the case and that is something we have to put on the table
2910579 no company will try to sell soap if they havent done research for the community they are trying to sell to
2910580 it would pay off if we could bring that experience from the business world to our amateur approaches
2910581 children orphaned by aids are sadly only the tip of the iceberg of hiv affected children
2910582 it is the needs of all children especially vulnerable children not whether they meet the definition of orphan that must be our primary focus
2910583 the focus on orphans had individualized the challenge of care and support it has framed the epidemics impact on children as individuals rather than a national social problem and has separated assistance to children from efforts to support families and communities
2910584 2010 is 18 months from now what weve seen is that in a number of countries theyve already reached their universal access targets others not
2910585 when we look at global targets none of us believes that it will be 100 everywhere
2910586 but if you look at individual countries and if you look at the percent that have achieved universal coverage or will be close to universal coverage there may be much more than you think of
2910587 h omophobia biology and misplaced confidence that aids has become a treatable chronic illness are contributing to a disturbing flashback among scientists and activists
2910588 appear to be repeating the early patterns of the epidemic
2910589 an enormous grassroots movement sparked government action and more significantly effective prevention campaigns
2910590 we have come full circle in the beginning gay men in places like san francisco and new york proved we could do prevention when we moved from that and started talking about the broad scope of the epidemic suddenly men who have sex with men became marginalized
2910591 prevention fatigue confidence in new antiretroviral drugs the use of methamphetamines and the arrival of a generation of young men who did not experience the ravages of the 1980s
2910592 the same kinds of stigma and discrimination and institutionalized homophobia that failed gay men in america is now failing msm in the rest of the world
2910593 its difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries where they dont acknowledge they exist
2910594 failed to bring down the incidence of hiv aids in msm because we have not tried
2910595 because machismo is pronounced in mexico and homosexuality is far from accepted social conditions in the country and in other parts of latin america force much sexual behavior into the shadows that increases the challenges that aids experts say they face in combating the risky sexual practices that fuel the disease
2910596 im not asking for special access for those who are coinfected with hiv and hepatitis just fairness in access
2910597 its true that organs for transplant are in short supply but nonetheless those with hiv hepatitis b or c can be equally good candidates
2910598 however here we are in mexico city still in the middle of a raging pandemic
2910599 to be sure there are multiple and daunting challenges ahead in terms of how we confront hiv globally not all but certainly some of these challenges can only be addressed through biomedical research
2910600 even with the drugs we have today or with forms of the drugs that are very similar to what we have today if we could develop forms of these drugs that could be taken for life with acceptable levels of toxicity than its in principle possible to offer everyone who is currently living with hiv infection the chance for a normal life this is the long term challenge that all of us face
2910601 prevention care and treatment for children continue to lag behind adults
2910602 support for affected children has been left largely to families extended kin and communities although they are the most appropriate group to care for children they cannot protect and care for children without assistance
2910603 when there is a country that discriminates that is conservative that criminalizes sex work the prevalence of hiv is higher
2910604 if the policy is bad today what will it mean for the next 20 years 50 years so that we start building campaigns building towards 2031 because by 2031 if we havent done anything it might be too late
2910605 from the ground up building comprehensive hiv aids care programs in resource limited settings

2910828 hallo daar wil je mij even vertellen hoe het nou allemaal zit met maxime en lies voor wie ga je
2910829 haha ik dacht dat je het nooit zou vragen ik ga helemaal voor maxime dus leef je uit vriend
2910830 liefste lies ik weet genoeg en nu kan ik jou eindelijk vertellen wat ik allemaal voel voor je ik wil natuurlijk niet overhaasten want jij kent me natuurlijk alleen nog maar als die bill kaulitz op het podium maar zou je vannacht bij mij op de kamer willen slapen
2910831 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2910832 as the person who knows him best michelle will talk about the barack obama she knows and loves the values that drive him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president
2910833 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2910834 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2910835 wat ziet ze er weer goed uit h maar die vriendin van haar is ook niet verkeerd
2910836 haha natuurlijk en dan moeten jullie maxime ook eens horen die speelt al veel langer en beter dan ik
2910837 ik vind het zoo leuk dat je er weer bent echt waar ik vind het helemaal geweldig straks lekker shoppen en dan hoop ik dat ik vanavond goed nieuws krijg van de dokter dan is mijn dag weer helemaal goed hoelang blijven jullie trouwens als het aan mij ligt mogen jullie blijven slapen hoor
2910838 haha je wilt niet weten hoe leuk ik het vind ik bedoel jullie zijn nog steeds mijn grote idolen en het gebeurt niet vaak dat je dan ineens bij ze in huis zit laat je me straks dan wel even de winkels zien waar jij je kleren vandaan haalt en ik hoop ook echt voor je dat je goed nieuws krijgt van de dokter het is gewoon niet leuk om te moeten zien hoe jij jezelf in moet houden om niet te gaan praten en ik weet nog niet precies hoelang we blijven we moeten maandag wel weer terug zijn maar ik zou graag blijven slapen en ik geloof dat maxime daar ook niet veel bezwaar tegen heeft ze vond georg al geweldig en je had haar net moeten zien

2910843 ja lies ik voel echt wat voor je maar ik ben niet de enige daarom schreef ik dat ook ik moet eerst met hem praten voordat ik jou echt kan zeggen wat ik voor je voel ik hoop dat je dat kan begrijpen zullen we weer even naar beneden gaan om te kijken wat de andere aan het doen zijn
2910844 bill sorry dat ik me er zoveel mee bemoeide en ik wil wel even naar beneden hoor eens kijken of maxime inmiddels al wat tegen georg heeft durven zeggen
2910845 oh sorry ehm ja ik zal het niet meer doen ga jij nou eerst maar eens praten met die jongen dan zal ik straks mijn ouders even bellen of ik mag blijven slapen

2910852 de stijgende rente zorgt voor druk op de waardering van de panden
2910853 maar wat positief is is dat wij geen afwaarderingen hebben gedaan zoals het er nu uitziet verwachten we dat we dit ook niet hoeven te doen
2910854 we verwachten dat we op operationeel gebied de huidige lijn de rest van het jaar kunnen voortzetten
2910855 wij geven aan de markt aan dat we willen groeien
2910856 wel zou het kunnen zijn dat we tijdelijk pas op de plaats moeten maken vanwege de omstandigheden we wachten eerst af hoe de vastgoedmarkt zich gaat ontwikkelen
2910857 de koers moet eerst aanzienlijk aantrekken willen we daartoe overgaan

2910871 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
2910872 ive been a part of the two teams at the last two olympics that came out behind and i think i wanted it more than anybody not just for myself but to show that we are the nation to be beat in that relay
2910873 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
2910874 calls are made by fools like me but only god can referee
2910875 the greatest thrill is at the end of almost all the matches no matter how i did no matter how hard it was so many players would shake my hand and say nice game ref
2910876 because i could run well and i had a presence on the field
2910877 and they want to play the game for their school
2910878 to see the expression on his face was priceless when i saw his reaction i said i had to do this

2910972 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
2910973 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
2910974 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing

2910982 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2910983 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2910984 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2910988 if i have only one life let me live it as a blonde
2910989 women are out to fit the clothes instead of vice versa
2910990 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2910991 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2910994 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2910995 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2910996 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2910997 i cant necessarily attack facebook or myspace but i can attack their users all day long

2911011 we are delighted to welcome our new stakeholders into the dme they rank among the worlds most successful and sophisticated financial institutions and energy trading firms and their vote of confidence in the exchange is indicative of the success the dme has achieved to date as well as the strategic positioning of dubai as a financial hub bridging the time zones of europe asia and the united states
2911012 the addition of our new partners into the exchange marks yet another milestone in the development of the dme the desire of these institutions which form an important part of the financial and energy trading community to join the exchange as equity holders and strategic partners highlights the remarkable progress made by the dme to date in establishing an internationally recognised futures exchange
2911013 the strategic partnership with the dubai mercantile exchange is consistent with our commitment to the region
2911014 the dubai mercantile exchange not only offers strong potential from an investment perspective but also constitutes a strategic partnership that will develop our footprint in the middle east
2911015 a successful and liquid futures exchange linked to energy products in the region will help us to better manage some of the risks inherent in our own business and those of our clients we believe that the ongoing economic growth and development in dubai and wider gcc region will continue to drive the success of the dme delivering return on investment as well as enhanced opportunities for our global client base
2911016 vitol has been involved with the dme since its inception and we are delighted to have the opportunity to make a further commitment to the exchange by means of this equity purchase we have always held the view that the region needs a new price discovery mechanism for middle east crude oil destined for the eastern markets we believe that a regionally based futures exchange is the optimum way for the market to determine the value of middle east sour crude in a transparent and reliable way we remain confident that dme oman prices can be used by other producers as well as oman and dubai to price their crude and also that the dme contracts will become a very useful and powerful hedging tool for traders and refiners we congratulate the dme and its founder shareholders on their progress to date and looking forward to supporting and sharing in their further success in the future
2911017 it is very difficult especially when there is a rain the school is always floods and we have to walk across the water to school sometimes the skirt is wet and dirty it is not fair if we wear trousers teacher blames us
2911018 ministry of culture and fine art must take care of this especially the government must find good solution to improve the art of national identity
2911019 it is flooded because the school is located in the bottom of the lake the building company did not prepare good irrigation system and did not measure the high of land and water
2911020 it is flooded when there is a big rain there are good pipe systems there i have talked with the phnom penh governor about the road and he said it will be built in dry season last year we did not do it because we dont have enough money i also talked and contact with the school director about electricity and water

2911028 infantile madness is the inability to bear the frustration of unsatisfied desires
2911029 for the more deeply sane whatever else sanity might be it is a container of madness not a denier of it this sanity once again in its cartoon form often bears the wisdom that accrues from hardships endured and conflicts forborne this sane person has felt and acknowledged but not ultimately been overwhelmed by the rigours of his nature his sanity such as it is is both the cause and the consequence of not having conformed of discovering his true nature through a refusal to comply for the superficially sane adaptation is their religion for the deeply sane adaptation is what corrupts them and is experienced as a form of submission
2911030 by keeping the debate so exclusively about madness the mind doctors of the twentieth century like the psychologists and moralists of the nineteenth century have kept us and themselves in the dark about sanity
2911031 the deeply sane are rather more like tragic heroes and heroines who have survived their ordeals

2911063 mining operations have only commenced ramping up to significant production rates since april last year with production prior to this having been conducted on a small scale
2911064 as such much of the coal deposit remains relatively untouched by modern mining operations with the geology of the deposit enabling flexible mining operations using track and excavator methods this results in the operation remaining flexible with regard to mine planning options
2911065 this venture brings together an entrepreneurial indonesian business success story with international capital and australian mining technology and skills
2911066 with coal prices forecast to rise further on the track of increased demand we are confident that handini resources is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities presented

2911081 sozial schwache und jugendliche k nnen bisher oft praktisch nicht aus der kirche austreten da sie selbst geringe geb hren nicht aufbringen k nnen und ber befreiungsm glichkeiten nicht hinreichend aufgekl rt werden hier sehen wir dringenden verbesserungsbedarf
2911082 gleichwohl hatten wir nat rlich gehofft dass das bundesverfassungsgericht der religionsfreiheit gr eres gewicht beimessen w rde als es das in der entscheidung getan hat
2911083 f r uns kommt es darauf an dass jeder der aus der kirche austreten m chte dies auch tun kann theoretisch mag dies gew hrleistet sein wie wir aber von betroffenen aus der alltagspraxis wissen existiert zus tzlich zur unzureichenden aufkl rung oft auch noch eine beh rdliche behauptung es g be gar keine geb hrenbefreiung au erdem sind die kriterien f r eine ins ermessen der amtsgerichte und standes mter gestellte entscheidung hinsichtlich der gew hrung einer geb hrenbefreiung v llig intransparent
2911084 obviously i was trying to win but thats it its not disappointing every time youre out there trying to win a major what can you do there can only be one winner im fine
2911085 it was worse when i finished the open championship than this year than i am right now
2911086 thats the way it goes the good thing about it is i feel good out there i felt like i played good i definitely feel like i played well enough to win but unfortunately it didnt happen so thats pretty much all i can ask myself to do
2911087 why because i lost it there on the back nine when you give it your best and the end result is not what you wish for its hard but you feel good you feel like you gave it your best
2911088 there i kind of lost control a little bit and i didnt have a chance when after nine i did have a chance of doing something so its not disappointing
2911089 obviously things like that will take time to sink in
2911090 at the moment im just enjoying the pga win for the pga win
2911091 i really do like the fact that no other european has won two majors consecutively though because obviously i hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
2911092 to believe that i achieved something that they hadnt is very special
2911093 i actually struggle with things that are comfortable its something that i work with with sports psychologist bob rotella im better off i definitely have a little bit of i want to be fighting it
2911094 and thats why i have done well when things like this week when im not quite on my game ive won many a tournament where i felt i wasnt swinging as well as i could and performed poorly sometimes when i felt i was swinging well
2911095 so im a bit a little bit of a contrast like that but im getting better as i said at the open championship i did it when i felt good about my game and that was important to me
2911096 its a fascinating thing this week that i definitely didnt have my golf swing
2911097 my co ordination was out all week on thursday and friday i couldnt get to the clubhouse quick enough my game was going downhill very quickly out on the golf course
2911098 when i went back and had a look at it and had a discussion with my trainer at home it was possible that i was dehydrated and thats what caused the lack of co ordination
2911099 so it gave me something to focus on i focused on friday evening and saturday and all through saturday and sunday in rehydrating myself and at least whether that was the cause or not whether it was it might have been tiredness as well

2911102 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
2911103 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
2911104 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
2911105 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
2911106 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
2911107 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
2911108 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
2911109 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
2911110 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
2911111 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
2911112 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
2911113 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
2911114 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
2911115 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
2911116 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
2911117 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
2911118 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
2911119 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
2911120 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
2911121 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
2911122 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
2911123 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
2911124 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
2911125 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
2911126 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
2911127 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
2911128 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
2911129 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
2911130 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
2911131 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
2911132 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
2911133 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
2911134 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
2911135 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
2911136 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
2911137 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
2911138 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
2911139 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
2911140 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
2911141 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
2911142 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
2911143 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
2911144 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
2911145 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
2911146 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
2911147 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
2911148 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
2911149 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
2911150 in every case pain had been the price of admission into a new life
2911151 but this admission price had purchased more than we expected it brought a measure of humility which we soon discovered to be a healer of pain
2911152 i learned that the pain of my defects is the very substance god uses to cleanse my character and to set me free
2911153 a few weeks before sept 11th my wife and i found out we were going to have our first child she planned a trip out to california to visit her sister on our way to the airport we prayed that god would grant my wife a safe trip and be with her shortly after i said amen we both heard a loud pop and the car shook violently we had blown out a tire i replaced the tire as quickly as i could but we still missed her flight both very upset we drove home i received a call from my father who was retired fdny he asked what my wifes flight number was but explained that we missed the flight my father informed me that her flight was the one that crashed into the southern tower i was too shocked to speak my father also had more news for me he was going to help this is not something i can just sit by for i have to do something i was concerned for his safety of course but more because he had never given his life to christ after a brief debate i knew his mind was made up before he got off of the phone he said take good care of my grandchild those were the last words i ever heard my father say he died while helping in the rescue effort my joy that my prayer of safety for my wife had been answered quickly became anger anger at god at my father and at myself i had gone for nearly 2 years blaming god for taking my father away my son would never know his grandfather my father had never accepted christ and i nevergot to say goodbye then something happened about 2 months ago i was sitting at home with my wife and my son when there was a knock on the door i looked at my wife but i could tell she wasnt expecting anyone i opened the door to a couple with a small child the man looked at me and asked if my fathers name was jake matthews i told him it was he quickly grabbed my hand and said i never got the chance to meet you ther but it is an honor to meet his son he explained to me that his wife had worked in the world trade center and had been caught inside after the attack she was pregnant and had been caught under debris he then explained that my father had been the one to find his wife and free her my eyes welled up with tears as i thought of my father giving his life for people like this he then said there is something else you need to know his wife then told me that as my father worked to free her she talked to him and lead him to christ i began sobbing at the news now i know that when i get to heaven my father will be standing beside jesus to welcome me and that this familywould be able to thank him themselves

2911182 from the earliest times civilization and city life have appeared to be inseparable although what makes a city varies from generation to generation one may at its foundation be a religious center the focus for the worship of a god another the setting in which a ruler displays himself through monumental buildings perhaps another may gain its energy from trading be primarily a centre where people meet to buy and sell where goods are unloaded from water for instance or where trade routes cross

2911245 not the stuff the american public wants to hear about in this election cycle
2911246 nonostante le ultime appararizioni siano state abbastanza deludenti non penso sia il caso di suonare il campanello dallarme non sono per niente preoccupato i test estivi servono a provare e riprovare tante cose studiate in allenamento e soprattutto a capire e limare i punti deboli ci sono molti giocatori nuovi che necessitano tempo e modo per entrare in condizione ed essere giudicati dopo 20 giorni trarre conclusioni mi sembra un po affreattato sono molto fiducioso per limminente stagione la rosa stata adeguatamente rinforzata chi partito stato rimpiazzato con un altro giocatore sempre allaltezza della piazza di udine poi il mister pasquale marino giovane e molto preparato quindi ritengo che la squadra possa fare ancora meglio rispetto alla scorsa stagione
2911247 e una punta devastante gi acquistata due anni fa dalla nostra societ dal cobrolea ma lasciata maturare con calma in queste ultime due stagioni prima al colo colo e poi al river plate squadra dove il ragazzo molto maturato riuscendo a vincere anche il torneo di clausura euna punta da grandi giocate eccelle in velocit e dribbling se dovessi paragonarlo ad un giocatore direi robinho e credo che non appena si inserir negli schemi della squadra sar il grande artefice di tanti successi riponiamo tante speranze in lui lo testimonia il fatto che per dargli continuit abbiamo ceduto asamoah allestero
2911248 onestamente non sono a conoscenza di queste voci e tantomeno che si arrivata in sede unofferta ufficiale per il giocatore posso solo dirvi che si tratta di un centrocampista di grande livello che fa della tecnica la sua arma migliore per lui quest sar lannata della consacrazione di certo la societ punta molto su di lui e credo che rester con noi nel futuro prossimo
2911249 senza dubbio la dirigenza ha svolto un grandissimo lavoro fino a questo momento sono arrivati giocatori di enorme valore che faranno sicuramente bene in una piazza esigente come quella napoletana da tifoso di una maglia che mi ha regalato le soddisfazioni pi grandi nella mia carriera spero davvero che gli azzurri possano regalarci grandi emozioni i tifosi partenopei meritano sicuramente una serata come quella del 17 maggio del 1989 della magica stoccarda da addetto ai lavori posso dire che lorganico deve a mio avviso ancora essere rinforzato magari con un regista dai piedi buoni e un esterno sinistro di esperienza due pedine fondamentali al salto di qualit dellintero collettivo sicuramente qualcuno arriver da qui al primo settembre poich nelle dichiarazioni rilasciate dal vostro presidente c la piena intenzione di comprare ancora
2911250 il calcio lo sport pi amato del mondo proprio questo fatto mi porta a dire che in tutto il mondo possa esserci un futuro talentino basta essere organizzati a livello societario in modo da coprire lintero globo con osservatori capaci e lungimiranti e in tal senso credo che in questi anni ludinese sia un vero e proprio modello da seguire abbiamo creato unorganigramma davvero preparato e di grandi qualit che ci ha permesso di scovare giocatori e portare la societ tra le prime della classe nel nostro paese

2911430 i saw it as a good opportunity to give back to the iraqi people since iraq doesnt have any kind of childrens hospital set up yet i had access to this resource so why not help
2911431 my wife talked to the head nurse at her hospital and got the number to the wheelchair company
2911432 the company needed the girls dimensions so we had to get in contact with the family this enabled the best fit possible for the girl leaving her some room to grow
2911433 they were shocked someone actually reacted to the needs of their child all i had to do was give a little and i was sure we would get a lot in return
2911434 he showed his dedication to the corps and our goal of seeing a better future in iraq
2911435 bringing the chair shows a sign of peace and goodwill and that we are not just here to fight a war we are here to help the iraqi people he is a selfless leader

2911458 in order to stop the east turkestan situation getting worse i urge the international community to exert pressure on china to immediately stop its systematic repressive government policies
2911459 in the past we wouldnt get hit so hard because of the kind of music we make
2911460 people would always turn to the spiritual music during hard times but if you spend more money than youre selling youre not recession proof this is the perfect storm everythings going wrong at once with illegal downloads and sharing and the recession and the proof of that is in the numbers
2911461 now even wal mart is starting to pass on records from new and developing artists and they were everybodys biggest buyer they buy 35 to 40 percent of gospel but these days youve got to have heat on a record airplay and a solid story to tell
2911462 is at an all time high people just dont want to buy it seventy percent of the people getting the music are doing it for free with the bulk of sales lost to sharing with tumbling sales have come tumbling budgets
2911463 the cost of doing business is higher and the return is a lot lower
2911464 at the end of the day every time you spend money it is with the hope you have the return of product sales and when youre not sure you have to think twice
2911465 for alabaster box we spent upwards of 500 000 and still made money it used to take a lot of money to get the coverage you need but now you cant spend that kind of money because the return is not going to be so much and we dont have the luxury of buying for the possibility of exposure anymore it needs to pay off
2911466 it is not uncommon for someone to ask you to break a brand new artist for 20 000 and there are a lot of labels who will do only interactive marketing and thats it it will also hit home with some of the older artists who have been cut from their labels and cant understand why a new deal is yet to be found you can forget the days of being discovered in a mall today labels will want you to build your name and a solid following first
2911467 we are signing new artists but we are looking for them to be self contained and to already have somewhat of a following
2911468 like a jonathan nelson someone whos been around for years but is looking for that major label break
2911469 putting an artist out there in the traditional sense is not going to work anymore a lot of artists are going to get a reality check some of the new artists want to compete with jay z so in a sense this period is correcting the market its back to old school where people are going to really have to be sincere about their ministry and not being the next big crossover act thats why marvin sapp is doing so well
2911470 im actually pleased that some of the fluff is going away
2911471 instead its about making music from the heart to touch the hearts of others
2911472 people will still buy gospel as long as there is a song on the album thats compelling enough to buy and marvin sapp is proof of that
2911473 we just need to create a way to get the revenue so that we can continue providing the service
2911474 its a faith walk for her to unify the body of christ something she feels god is calling her to do
2911475 i believe its going to come down to getting black churches to help out with the situation not from the standpoint of saying if you continue to use our songs you have to pay but to get the power of their endorsement in compelling people to buy
2911476 one thing is sure were getting ready to find out what real ministry is about
2911477 taking a break from recording and playing as a band
2911478 and were still in a good place as a band the decision isnt because weve all fallen out with each other which is always a good thing it was a really difficult decision but ultimately my wife anna and i felt like we needed a change in rhythm and pace so delirious will carry on to the end of 2009 and then were going to take a complete break
2911479 didnt want to miss all the key moments because theyre still so young
2911480 looking forward to seeing what god wants to do next
2911481 i would love to branch out a little bit and write pop songs something ive never really been allowed to do before
2911482 who knows maybe even country now ill get to spread my wings a bit
2911483 you know what i think itll come together again i dont think itll be the last time we play together but right now i think its good that everyone goes off and does his own thing for a little bit
2911484 the reason i put hello in front of love is because i feel like weve often lost sight of the idea of true love and really loving people
2911485 my whole life ive written worship songs and worship basically boils down to our love for god his love coming down to us and our love for people
2911486 jesus said love the lord your god with all your heart all your soul all your mind and all your strength and love your neighbor as yourself what hes really calling for people to do is to take care of each other to help the poor and the troubled
2911487 we see all these disasters going on everywhere in the world and we need to love each other and help each other out so the album is really a call to that
2911488 just having them sing this song really speaks to the audience about the power of love because these kids couldve been abandoned themselves but someone loved them and took care of them and their lives are forever changed as a result
2911489 britney is a song about what our culture says and does to young women these days
2911490 its about the lies we tell them about fame and money and whats beautiful and what will give them life its actually an apology for those lies but more than that its an invitation to the truth about a god who is bigger than the pain this world so often leaves them in
2911491 i was contacted shortly after brads death to write something about what he meant to me as a singer and it was posted on the internet as a tribute
2911492 people from founding guitarist songwriter tom scholzs camp read it and contacted my management after being touched by what i said they hadnt heard me sing but heard of stryper and invited me to sing at what they thought was going to be the last boston show ever but as we started playing and singing together at rehearsals tom said oh my gosh weve never sounded so good and those feelings translated to us working together which is all pretty wild
2911493 its amazing because we go through phases in life when we think gods not there or you wonder why youre having such a tough time or dry spell
2911494 but then something happens that changes your life and its something you never wouldve guessed thats how god works if you just trust him and let him do it in his time i feel like gods given me a chance of a lifetime here to really step up to the plate and be a true example to everyone around me and i dont want to take that for granted or blow it
2911495 i believe that the christian music community should always be proactive in organizations such as this as there are many people that have been affected by suicide and depression and we need to reach out with grace hope and love
2911496 my song on the cd your beautiful mind was written about a friend of mine that was on the edge she was always questioning the meaning of life and where we were going after death as an atheist she challenged my own thought process but in the end i believe this song was a message to her in part saying that the beauty of life is obvious and right in front of us we just need to look for it even when it is difficult to find anything good in it
2911497 we have really enjoyed the opportunity to surprise people with breakfast on their way into work and the stations always seemed happy that we were there
2911498 we got a chance to perfect the art of pancake making on them and hang out for a few hours in their studios it was a good experience all around for both us and them
2911499 harrington may get to 2nd in the world possibly but not 1 there is more space between woods and the 2 spot than there is between 2 and 250 according to the official world rankings
2911500 if harrington wins will he become world 1 i assume if golf rankings are anything like tennis rankings then tiger will be losing loads of points and two majors in a row is going to give harrington a pretty nice boost
2911501 will it be a 3 hole playoff in the event of a tie and will it be played today
2911502 i bet garcia bottles it he is good but when it comes to the majors he just doesnt have the nerve to see it through curtis or harrington will take it by one stroke
2911503 i was picked once for the seve trophy and it was horrible i cant imagine what being picked for the ryder cup is like
2911504 harrington goes to one under time for his back 9 charge i think mabye a repeat of the 2007 british open harrington winning and leaving more despair for garcia in second place
2911505 how come not a single word about jm singh there are a billion of us rooting for him
2911506 harrington to win step two of his grand slam today
2911507 had a cheeky tenner on sergio at 22 1 pre tournament and im going on holiday to spain next week vamos senor
2911508 curtis steady but showing a few nerves all the same wis lack of experience will see him fall away i reckon mickelson seems to feel a sense of responsibility to perform while harrington gambles and loses my prediction is garcia curtis mickelson in 1 2 3 i think sergio can feel this ones his oops then garcias drive goes to hollywood
2911509 quote from cbs commentators its a bit chilly hear in oakland hills temperatures of 67 degrees chilly 67 degrees my god when its 67 degrees here in scotland im out on the course with t shirt shorts and factor 50 sunblock
2911510 garcias cookin looks determined too demons what demons and playing alongside ph the pressures on padraig
2911511 time for the europeans to rip it lets have justin rose in the top 3 we need him for the ryder cup bet you monty gets a wildcard pick from faldo which would be an error in my view
2911512 i think sergio will finally come good in a play off with curtis and master padraig
2911513 this bizarre tournament gets even more bizarre with richard green and louis oosthuizen actually teeing off the latest from the 10th how must they feel
2911514 wouldnt it be great if tiger was really reading im behind harrington all the way tonight

2911570 this is a win for those growers in far north queensland who have invested their own hard earned funds to show that a positive difference can be made on farm
2911571 the minister has now recognised that to go the next step and involve the majority of growers they need to be offered assistance to act
2911572 it was encouraging to hear him support the partnership approach between industry organisations such as growcom the natural resource management groups and wwf in this endeavour
2911573 the minister confirmed 30 million will be allocated this financial year
2911574 this will be directed by the nrm regional groups and by industry bodies such as growcom who have been invited to submit proposals and industry delivery plans to the government by 12 september

2911592 if you want to hire a union organizer you probably know what to look for someone with resilience passion persistence and excellent interpersonal skills what if you want to hire someone to build an online community somebody to create and maintain a virtual world in which all the players in an industry feel like they need to be part of it like being the head of a big trade association but without the bureaucracy and tedium
2911593 ebay stores are not in competition with ebay auctions they cater to a totally different kind of customer they cater to buyers that want a product that is not in high demand but they want it now the management of ebay either fails to see this or does not want to admit it and in doing so they are missing a huge opportunity
2911594 ebay has changed whether or not the changes are permanent we wont know for a year or more down the road my items no longer make as much as i need so i have taken on a part time job i have accepted the limits of what i sell and replaced the missing income i do believe i could find another product line or lines and increase my income but at the moment i am burned out and not willing to do the research or invest the money necessary i will be willing to put in that effort down the road right now i enjoy just going to work and bringing home that money i put in the hours i get the money i think there is a future for ebay and ebay sellers but at this point im not sure im interested in remaining one of them i think my time would be better spent elsewhere investing my time and money in an online business in some other place than ebay whether its amazon my own website or a group effort i just have reached the point im not sure ebay is worth the effort but i do believe some place online is

2911598 for us a minaret is indispensable its like asking christians to build a church without a bell tower a minaret has a very important function precisely because it is visible it would show muslims who come to genoa but do not know the city where they can go to pray

2911604 while the judges are no saints the attack by the ruling party is worsening the situation
2911605 the accusation that judges are counter revolutionary is aimed at intimidating them when they consider the jacob zuma and other high profile anc cases
2911606 the current attacks on the judiciary do not address the inefficiencies in the justice system perceived or real
2911607 the appointment of chief justice and his her deputy currently they are appointed by the president who is himself a deployee of a political party under the circumstances who would they be accountable to
2911608 once this has been conducted contracts found to have been secured corruptively sic should be revoked

2911611 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2911612 he who is the glory of israel does not lie or change his mind for he is not a man that he should change his mind
2911613 i also really wanted to look beyond ebay and how ebay sellers can use ebay as a springboard for other selling online
2911614 how do we decide what the bible says about homosexuality
2911615 just list it they customers will come sellers are not entitled to a nice profit just because they list items i dont blame ebay for my business failure because when the market dynamics changed i was not prepared to handle it sellers need to learn to be responsible for their own business
2911616 stores arent part of core its that simple stores can be a profitable part of an ebay business but ebay never claims it is one size fits all they never say put all your inventory in a store and your sales will go up you have to be responsible for picking and choosing the services that ebay offers only you can decide the best listing formats and the best mix of listing formats for your particular business of course ebay is going to encourage you to use all of them thats their job your job is to exercise judgment about whether their recommendations are actually a good business decision for you

2911671 i am talking to veteran theatre personality barry john my mentor and guru who taught me theatre for seven years i would like to return to the stage with him since i am comfortable acting under his guidance i told barry a few days ago to think of a play in hindi in which we can team up together on stage
2911672 i have done my bit for the delhi stage i spent 11 years in the capital doing theatre for almost 18 hours a day
2911673 we were so engrossed with the stage and so happy that we almost forgot our dream of making it big in mumbai till of course shekhar kapur came to our rescue and reminded us that we had to pay our bills
2911674 we ashish vidyarthi piyush mishra and myself wanted to excel everyday and every hour piyush spent almost 10 years on the stage and ashish nearly seven years i do not have any regrets
2911675 i told them give some time to yourself there is no one to help them in mumbai no godfather and no uncle
2911676 but qualitatively it is as good in contrast western indian metropolises have a very commercial and vibrant gujarati stage because it caters to the masses
2911677 marathi theatre used to be good and experimental once upon a time with towering personalities like vijay tendulkar kolkata had equally good theatre but television has taken its toll people are now reluctant to leave the cushy comfort of their drawing room and their lcd and plasma television screens to watch theatres
2911678 i have come across so much talent on my journeys to native state bihar who cannot afford to come to delhi or mumbai

2911684 look at jannat its success is so welcome but i cant do something too different with govinda because i cant play around with audiences expectations
2911685 im simultaneously launching my son jackie in vivek sharmas kal kissne dekha while he will be shooting it in south africa ill be with david and the crew for do knot disturb in delhi
2911686 an impressive funeral will be held at ramallahs cultural center and darwishs burial plot will be located on a hill overlooking the city

2911688 i would like my son to be buried here but he isnt just my son hes the entire arab worlds son
2911689 all these years we asked him to come home but he kept saying that his home may be here but his work was over there
2911690 i think he would like to be buried here although he loved haifa as well
2911691 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2911692 the absence of our great poet mahmud darwish the love of palestine and the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2911693 two state solution collapses the state of israel is finished
2911694 wed been fishing in the south near rafah and were followed by a boat around 5am on our way back in as we landed they fired rockets at us i lost my hand in the attack and my brother was hit by shrapnel
2911695 they the israelis beat me up and broke my left arm and for the first two months i was given electric shocks
2911696 what right have they to ban me from fishing in gazas waters
2911697 most boats are tied up and if this continues the industry will be dead this time next year
2911698 and hamas a terror organisation who took control over the strip more than a year ago is fully responsible for the fate of the strip and its people israel has been supplying fuel food medical supplies and other humanitarian assistance in spite of incessant attacks carried out by hamas and other organizations on border crossings
2911699 it is apparent that hamas is targeting crossings in order to prevent the transfer of humanitarian aid to the civilian population thus cynically depriving its own population and causing an artificial crisis in the gaza strip recent reports indicate that hamas is allocating these supplies for its own use thus deepening the deprivation of the public clearly hamas wants to create a crisis in order that international pressure will be placed on israel
2911700 we dont underestimate israel at all and have done a lot of what ifs the past few days weve discussed how to react if they blow up the boat board us arrest us shoot us hire somebody in gaza to harm us tow us or stop us
2911701 weve been looking at what happens if they say the waters are mined or they have robot submarines in the area we can give them our route ahead of time our safety is in their hands they have guns weapons mines and robot submarines all we are carrying is 200 hearing aids and 5000 balloons there is not a single militant among us

2911731 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia
2911732 here we are trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place
2911733 there needs to be international mediation for the south ossetia issue
2911734 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2911735 the talks are still ongoing theres been a great deal of progress the deal is very close it is about to be closed
2911736 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2911737 were disappointed anytime that someone is unable to worship freely
2911738 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2911739 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2911740 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2911741 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2911742 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2911743 the whole issue was created by separatist leaders who would like to stop the hindu pilgrimage the real motive is a complete islamisation of the valley after having successfully forced kashmiri hindus to leave the valley
2911744 this is not a struggle merely for 100 acres of land this is the struggle for the identity of our motherland
2911745 troops had killed 60 ltte terrorists and 28 were wounded from sundays confrontations
2911746 the death injuries and loss due to this attack typical when sri lanka air force bombs a heavily populated area in vanni have been repeated more than one hundred times over the vanni area over a period of two years
2911747 yes its a little disappointing i knew i was in a marginal seat and the fact that the swing has gone against the party has probably cost me my seat
2911748 its another chapter of my life thats closed and well move on from there
2911749 when you take on a job as a minister there are some tough decisions to be made
2911750 i felt that the decisions that were made in my portfolio were for the betterment of the northern territory people its created jobs and its helped the economy and thats what its all about when you step into the shoes of a minister
2911751 the major issues weve got are no different now to what they were before the election including roads and infrastructure and regional health services and a commitment to a live export trade
2911752 its really going to be very important from now on that someone does pay a lot of attention to the issues and listens
2911753 if its a close call in parliament any issues we have on the table will be debated quite strongly thats going to be a natural occurrence when youve got a situation like we potentially may have
2911754 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2911755 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2911756 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2911757 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2911758 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2911759 we come with militaries that have advantages in command and control in speed in lethality in logistics in intelligence in all those things
2911760 if nations provide forces with restrictions what it does is it decreases those advantages
2911761 how fast we can get there i dont know but it is important that the international community remain committed to afghanistan
2911762 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2911763 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2911764 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2911765 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan
2911766 the statements from the whole group result in a total lack of coherence from which we easily conclude that theyre all lying
2911767 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible to include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents lack of communication is torture
2911768 there is a sense of anger frustration and great sadness theyve waited for this evidence of sightings for a long time its work they could have started 15 months ago but this is the time for them to keep focus and consider everything carefully before deciding what course of action to take then they will have their day they will make their views clear
2911769 i believe he can recommend charges or action be taken against the police as a whole as well as individual officers
2911770 the early stages of the investigation led by detectives in portimao really were very poor
2911771 a number of people had touched the window and entered madeleines and the twins room prior to the arrival of the gnr local police
2911772 her eyes met mine as i walked past and thats when i saw the little blemish in her right eye it was like a little fleck
2911773 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
2911774 one must suppose that the child madeleine mccann could have died inside the apartment
2911775 the whole attitude throughout was one of we think theyre involved there are some vague indications lets throw caution to the wind and see if we can get a conviction
2911776 the documents are a field of potential leads and any one of them could unlock the case they will never give up the search for madeleine
2911777 a network with all kinds of criminal activities really does exist but the authorities dont want to look into it
2911778 in general paedophiles ask for a particular type of abuse rather than a particular child
2911779 the majority of sexual abuse occurs in the home or by people the child knows
2911780 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you

2911784 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2911785 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2911786 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2911787 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2911788 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states

2911790 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2911791 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2911792 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president
2911793 we are made up of people of every conceivable racial background

2911810 es una pregunta dif cil para nosotros los cristianos por qui n votar soy estadounidense soy latino y soy cristiano
2911811 lo que s s es que ning n partido puede dar por sentado que tiene nuestro voto
2911812 el voto latino cat lico sigue siendo primordialmente dem crata pero el evang lico con george w bush en 2004 se inclin fuertemente por el partido republicano
2911813 yo s c mo es su coraz n y lo que siente sobre los hispanos y los inmigrantes
2911814 en cuatro elecciones anteriores apoy otra plataforma partido pero este a o decid apoyar a obama porque l representa el cambio que nuestro pa s necesita y con l tendremos una voz y un voto
2911815 yo francamente no me siento plenamente identificado con ninguno con los dem cratas por su postura pro aborto y con los republicanos por su actitud hacia los inmigrantes
2911816 no tenemos que estar de acuerdo con todo lo que piense un presidente no es un pastor ni un papa es un jefe de gobierno
2911817 no es cierto que mccain se ech para atr s en este asunto
2911818 no parece que l tenga mucha influencia en ese sentido

2911822 el ruido que puede producir la manifestaci n personal o colectiva de un credo puede en muchos casos perturbar derechos de terceros y por consiguiente ser un factor que trastorne la paz la tranquilidad la intimidad e incluso a largo plazo la salud y vida de las personas que se ven constantemente expuestas a un desequilibrio del medio ambiente

2911868 if i still have luck i would come back and die on thai soil like every other thai person
2911869 what happened to my family and me is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
2911870 there is a continuation of dictatorship in managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system

2911874 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2911875 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2911876 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2911877 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2911878 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2911879 the reality is a specification was developed that was put out to the marketplace
2911880 british aerospace submitted a successful tender and now british aerospace has an inability to deliver on that specification
2911881 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2911882 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2911883 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2911884 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2911885 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2911886 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2911887 he listened politely i cant read his mind but i do know that every time i met with him i pressed the point
2911888 we dont want adults sending mixed messages to children that its ok to shoot up drugs in order to become a star because its not ok
2911889 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally
2911890 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2911891 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2911892 why do you keep asking me the same question again and again although i have told you so many times it is a crow are you not able to understand this
2911893 today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa when a crow was sitting on the window my son asked me 23 times what it was and i replied to him all 23 times that it was a crow i hugged him lovingly each time h e asked me the same question again and again for 23 times i did not at all feel irritated i rather felt affection for my innocent child
2911894 i want to see my parents happy forever they have cared for me ever since i was a little child they have always showered their selfless love on me they crossed all mountains and valleys without seeing the storm and heat to make me a person presentable in the society today
2911895 im sorry to say this as a life long fan and for the last few for me at least unforgettable months employee mcfc as we know it is finished
2911896 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
2911897 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
2911898 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
2911899 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us

2911902 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
2911903 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
2911904 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
2911905 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
2911906 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
2911907 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
2911908 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
2911909 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos

2911913 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
2911914 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
2911915 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
2911916 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
2911917 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
2911918 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad

2911951 i hadnt realised that each morning id wake to face a fresh mutiny each chapter trying to overthrow me as the boat fills with water
2911952 if you try our techniques on the practice problems in most popular gmat coaching books you will probably decide they dont work because the practice questions in those books are very different from the questions on real gmats one reason coaching books do not use real gmat questions is that the gmac wont let them so far the council has refused to let anyone including us license actual questions from old tests

2912040 some forward movement and very positive messages related to gay and lesbian members
2912041 the core being of gay or lesbian is no longer a sin in and of itself
2912042 a lot of us in affirmation see that as great progress
2912043 slowly coming that direction change in the smallest form does take time but i believe members are starting to understand its not inherently a sin just to be gay
2912044 one of the highest suicide rates in the united states
2912045 affirmation leaders believe the lds leaders have contributed to these tragedies by the way they talk about and to gay people tonight a gay teenager will be thrown out onto the street by his or her lds family contributing to an above average homeless rate for adolescents in the mountain west and northwest states
2912046 throughout the church families are being broken apart often forever because family members dont know how to deal with a loved one who tells them that he or she is gay
2912047 the items that we had planned to discuss with the church all focus on education and toning down some of the rhetoric nothing that we will be proposing requires any change in doctrine
2912048 will they lose a temple recommend be disfellowshipped or encouraged to resign
2912049 might be better spent what if it supported premarital counseling to help people before they enter marriage provided universal health care what if it supported paid paternity leave so women who work could stay home with new babies what about day care or job sharing
2912050 since i make the assignments i assigned myself to be here

2912064 if you are a hard core fan of kiss you want everything kiss has ever done everything my relationship with vinyl may be stronger because of when i grew up
2912065 high end fashion is incorporating a lot of the iconic images into fashion and accessories
2912066 we have a lot younger kids as young as 11 coming in with their dad or their mum
2912067 the teens tend to go through the second hand bins looking for anything old like cat stevens and that stuff and then you have the fashionistas who want vinyl because its cool i think also what is happening is that people want something tangible its all well or good seeing that little file on your computer but some people are what we call completists they just have to have everything a band ever releases right through to bootlegs youll find led zeppelin and metallica fans do that a lot
2912068 they still want to hear the crackle of the needle and they are the hardest of hardcore music fans
2912069 and for me and powderfinger who grew up on vinyl for us that connects an aural pathway back to when you first discovered music a connection that unites all the music you first heard whether it was abba or led zeppelin
2912070 friends love looking through them all and you get used to it having to pack them all up when you move i wonder if 16 year olds today are going oh downloads are great whether they will embrace vinyl remains to be seen
2912071 if it had a cool cover or youd see a burt bacharach record and youd want to check out what he did or a cool film soundtrack youd get it
2912072 listening to those albums made us want to work out how they did it

2912082 we are grateful to you australians you were so good to us from the beginning
2912083 there have been many theories on why australia one i remember is that you are outsiders on one side of the globe and we are outsiders on the other side so we take to each other
2912084 everyone asks how could this happen why i dont know
2912085 i asked benny what is it that you and bj rn do that gets a hook in peoples heart and even if you try you cant get this song out of your head
2912086 its a specific kind of gift that they have some people have it theres a lot of number one records that youve forgotten by next year theirs survived for 30 years the beatles survive

2912089 you can give at least half of it away to something good
2912090 they are mad for musicals in korea and mamma mia has been a huge hit

2912092 they soon realised that it wasnt a typical musical meryl streep gets 007 pierce brosnan and darcy colin firth and 007 sings abba songs even 15 year olds swoon at darcy and 007
2912093 i knew that if we were going to make a film i wanted hollywood involved as we needed the big machine of a major studio to make this a success the handling of the film internationally was very important as we needed it to be released in all countries simultaneously but control was a big issue
2912094 i have been working on the film every day for the past year and a half

2912100 and he said to me we havent done this for years were just going to feel our way through it but that was the one that was used
2912101 when youre listening to each other closely and not worried about yourself
2912102 but i really did think ill sing as good or as bad as i do for this ill just be the size and shape and person that i am nothing more nothing less
2912103 but we also have the disapprobation of our teenagers which for me was part of the reason to do it to make them cringe
2912104 im not allowed to sing at home so i thought all right ill sing in a movie that ought to get em
2912105 you dont want to ever stop being young a heart jumping dancing having your heart leap and why should you
2912106 certainly im in a business thats all about not living to an expectation that i look a certain way all the time or that im going to behave a certain way or that theres an appropriate way to behave
2912107 if i were a doctor or lawyer or a stockbroker id probably think about that much more but id probably not do very well in those positions because i like to push the boundaries in a little bit more
2912108 he had this little twinkle in his eye and he was very welcoming but about half way through i realised i was doing an audition and that if everything did not go well i would not be doing the musical and then i got really nervous
2912109 but i think its a good thing to feel unnerved and on the spot
2912110 my private mantra has always been do what you dont want to do
2912111 we have all had dreams where we had a test that was due or we were in a play and we werent aware we were cast in the lead
2912112 i think were at our best when the most is asked of us especially when we ask the most of ourselves when we move on to unfamiliar ground and certainly that was part of this
2912113 if you believe that money drives the dream and the bottom line determines what you are going to see on screen and that is true the people who are in charge of making those decisions are almost uniformly men and they will never as a group live their own fantasies out through a female protagonist
2912114 it always takes them aback when they are able to do so
2912115 we dont have the same problem of entering a heros head and imagining its happening to us
2912116 but i dont think you can see it as a trend ever because the studio heads have to relearn this lesson every time
2912117 when the budget came forward for mamma mia it was the size of a peanut next to the other summer films they are going to do very well with it and its going to be a complete and utter shock to them again
2912118 yes it is important to me that the feeling i have is corroborated by the market
2912119 its important for all films that have women in them in the central role with the men more to the side because usually its the other way around
2912120 we looked at each other and we were convinced none of us would ever work again
2912121 the very idea of the production is you have to allow yourself to be very silly and throw your pride away at the door
2912122 you cant get half hearted once youre wearing that you just have to play up to it its as simple as that
2912123 one of my reasons for taking the job was that costume really
2912124 you are an actor because youre an old queen whatever reason people give its because you wanted to put mascara and a frock on thats your main instinct and i just saw the fun in it
2912125 when can we start her name alone was enough to convince the rest of the big name cast to jump on board
2912126 a piece of cake she didnt hit one wrong note
2912127 i dont even remember going to be i think my daughter would take my clothes off because i was so tired
2912128 i just kept the mantra meryls in it im working with meryl
2912129 people say to me god you must hear dancing queen now and groan but the music never gets boring and its still a pleasure
2912130 its a mark of something about the piece and fundamentally the music that it just has this enduring appeal
2912131 in no way is it artistically schizophrenic its all part of one thing and one approach
2912132 what ive learnt from the other work is that while you have to be ferociously committed to what you want to achieve and not leave a single thing to chance in making a big project happen youve also got to be incredibly open to the thoughts of everyone around you
2912133 its nothing to do with ironic 1970s retro theyre just extremely bloody good songs theyre here 35 years later for that reason alone its amazing how much passion and reflectiveness is in them and theyre written by a lyricist who was not writing in his own language
2912134 you have to honestly feel that youre the keeper of the keys
2912135 in the theatre you rehearse with a group of actors and you can have days where you wait for something to happen for combustion and magic to appear
2912136 its a long game like cricket and you can still improve the show after it actually starts with film you have to score a bulls eye every day its like opening a theatre show for 80 consecutive days
2912137 wed be working together and id have an idea that id try to sing
2912138 benny would just give me this look withering pity is probably the best description
2912139 benny and bj rn worked so brilliantly with us and made us feel so much better about it that we were all kind of teenyboppers by the end of half an hour we were standing like the andrews sisters by the microphone singing waterloo
2912140 everything on this film was enjoyable once wed crossed a few fear thresholds what i think the magic of it is for the audience is we all know the songs and we all have a past as well so you hear the fist three notes of a song and everyone is suddenly connected
2912141 he vehemently denies this but i know he retained the right to veto any choices right till the very end
2912142 in fact they didnt release the rights to the music until just before we started shooting
2912143 he had this little twinkle in his eye and he was very welcoming but about half way through i realised i was doing an audition and that if everything did not go well i would not be doing the musical and then i got really nervous
2912144 walking into the studio for the first time stellan pierce and myself all three of us felt we couldnt do it
2912145 to just look at this spiral of fear pierces eyes we were certainly bonded by blind terror
2912146 but benny and bj rn worked so brilliantly with us and made us feel so much better about it we were all teenyboppers by the end of half an hour
2912147 i should have prepared more than i did but it was really fun
2912148 i realised i was not going to be famed russian dancer maya plisetskaya or anything im not a great dancer im not a great singer but well i sing and dance well enough to run a hotel which is what her character donna does
2912149 every day we seem to have one song stuck in our head which becomes infuriating after a while
2912150 i became an actor if i had to nail why it wouldnt have been to be mr darcy
2912151 it was far more to do with putting on purple spandex and a lot of slap and prancing around
2912152 he vehemently denies this but i know he retained the right to veto any choices right til the very end
2912153 in fact they didnt release the rights to the music until just before we started shooting
2912154 he had this little twinkle in his eye and he was very welcoming but about halfway through i realised i was doing an audition and that if everything did not go well i would not be doing the musical and then i got really nervous
2912155 walking into the studio for the first time we felt we couldnt do it
2912156 to look at this spiral of fear in pierces eyes we were certainly bonded by blind terror
2912157 she knows that people are so intimidated by the idea of her
2912158 so she shot that down immediately she said we love you in our house
2912159 shes so kind she just hugged me and we just talked about how nervous we were to sing and record with abba stars benny and bj rn
2912160 i dont know if thats just the way she is or if she was kind of manipulation the situation to make me feel better but whatever it was it was nice
2912161 id wake up like an eight year old i was so excited
2912162 i dont remember the last time i felt that enthusiasm
2912163 from the minute that started they never sat in their seat
2912164 they were up and bouncing and so was i and so were the old ladies on my right and the whole family of tourists on my left
2912165 for the first time in my career i actually thought there was a chance because im usually pretty negative
2912166 and it just goes to show how positivity can bring not luck but the confidence can really help you out a lot
2912167 i think its just like being a child and hearing the radio and not knowing what it is
2912168 she was really young when she got famous and she didnt know who she was for sure
2912169 it was sad because i feel like if she had just had a couple of years before things got crazy she could have handled it completely differently
2912170 she loved the attention and i think if id been her age i would have loved it too
2912171 i learnt from merryl streep that a really important element to having fame and being an actor is to separate your personal lie and your job
2912172 merryls built her career based on what she does on set in front of the camera where shes respected because of the parts she plays not who she is
2912173 colin firth doesnt have enough romantic charisma to light a 50 watt bulb hes too long in the tooth to play the romantic stuff
2912174 i still find myself wondering why anyone would find me sexy
2912175 i know that people did go mad and thought i was some kind of sex symbol especially when i came out of the lake but id never thought of myself as sexy
2912176 any appreciation you can get is not only flattering its also currency in terms of getting roles and staying employed in this business
2912177 i just feel i must be doing something right people want their work to be liked if youre still doing it after 20 odd years and people arent sick of you then it can only be helpful and pleasing really
2912178 thats the word im hearing most often about everything i do im in danger of being typecast in departures
2912179 i wasnt particularly attracted to it id never seen the show and no straight man of my generation would put up his hand as being an abba fan but then i found out that merryl streep was doing it and julie walters and stellan which added up to a group of people id love to work with
2912180 pierce stellan and myself were not hired for our dancing skills thats quite clear nobody auditioned us
2912181 they picked us on the basis that we were going to be three middle aged men dancing and singing in whatever capacity we were able to offer they could have hired john travolta or patrick swayze but they chose us its funny to put people who are hopeless on the dance floor
2912182 oh god no theres nothing worse i dont know if its vanity or modesty or whatever but i dont think actors like watching themselves you just have to trust that it comes across more sympathetically to other people than it does to you
2912183 whats not to like we were filming in a place that anyone would choose for a holiday in a way i felt as if it was piracy really taking the money it was called work but it was really just a holiday
2912184 when i was a child my father took us on a drive across the states
2912185 it was the most incredible thing it sort of challenged my life because i feel in live with the whole country i couldnt live there because i love london but the idea of being metaphorically lost for a while in the states in the mountains or something definitely still appeals
2912186 we have a very close relationship says firth of his eldest son theres a great difficulty with distance but weve managed to cope
2912187 my parents were incredibly affirming almost too much so making me feel i was brilliant and special
2912188 thats the aim no single event ever changes you as much as when you become a dad
2912189 i was always quite interested in plays and poetry and what good actors seemed capable of i was less and less interested in the career options teachers were presenting to me you know get a job get an apprenticeship do something nine to five which didnt seem very exciting whereas this other world which was to do with drama and the written word was much sexier
2912190 i allowed myself to be derailed into moody adolescent laziness
2912191 like everything once it becomes the day job it has its ups and downs and disappointments and banalities but yes im glad i chose it it frequently offers fantastic experiences
2912192 not for the great acting roles no i dont feel im someone who must give my king lear before i expire but i have to say these past 18 months have offered me some of the most interesting and satisfying work i can remember doing for a long time
2912193 i was absolutely disgusted by that actually i was just a dad pushing his kids on the swings to think theres someone hiding in the bushes with a lens when you think youre on your own its pretty revolting
2912194 i have small children thats pretty all consuming when im not working
2912195 rather than being a luvvie with a lofty opinion preaching to people i prefer to be involved and put my money where my mouth is
2912196 the first film was like a pastiche of the character in a way and it was very hard to stretch that any further in the second so i dont know if he can stand being reprised but maybe if enough time elapses and those characters were to come back in deteriorated state of advance old age or something it might be quite fun
2912197 i cant remember it very well any more it was 13 years ago and ive done so much since but if its an emblem of some kind to some people then thats perfectly all right with me
2912198 i dont know if the story can be verified but i found that rather charming
2912199 in fact taking the musical around the world wasnt part of the master plan
2912200 wed never wanted to sell the rights or let go of control of it so hopefully the timings right
2912201 you can go the other way and you can go too late evita a 1996 film version starring madonna came too far after the show
2912202 we thought we might as well get on with it
2912203 this is definitely a film when i started the stage show or had the whole idea the challenge was not to be the story of abba but to make the story out of the lyrics
2912204 the film is meant to be pure fun and it was really although the responsibility of making a film is not fun
2912205 but the film was exciting and you could see youre not restricted
2912206 one has to be careful that the film still comes back to the heart of the story and the songs and characters driving it
2912207 and the show is 2 hours with intermission yet the film has to be 100 minutes so you had to be economic in different ways and you had to tell things differently
2912208 i know phyllida had never directed a major movie but she had never directed a major musical either
2912209 but she loved scale and we all agreed that we wanted movie stars of course the studio obviously encouraged that meryl was very much on our wish list and once we got her life took its shape
2912210 were going to be singing abba songs on a greek island how bad can it be
2912211 i think this will attract like the show does in a way a cross generational audience i mean it is a date movie
2912212 yes its obviously not hellboy or the dark knight but it has an appeal to everyone really its not just for girls but because its humorous and its tongue in cheek boys can cope with the sexy romanticisms of it
2912213 they have a free day on monday however no activities have been scheduled as yet as they will be coming off a world tour having attended the london berlin and stockholm premieres of mamma mia theyll probably be extremely tired and looking to rest

2912282 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2912283 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2912284 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2912285 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2912286 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2912287 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2912288 it shows people are getting proficient at analysing apple software
2912289 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised

2912302 dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust
2912303 i just hit it so high so i was hoping it would go over the fence
2912304 i dont think anyone ever catches that with two fingers on the ball i definitely wish i would have made a better throw it kind of short hopped tek and that allowed the run to score
2912305 he threw me a good pitch im not trying to hit a double play but that was the result
2912306 he just has to keep plugging away and he always will
2912307 id love to say yes for sure but a blooper saturday night that fell in sometimes that is what starts it
2912308 i feel like my plate discipline is better hopefully that goes hand in hand with the execution
2912309 i mean we have not talked about that thats about as honest as i can be i think more of our energy and thoughts are going into how do we get this kid pitching like we know he can on a consistent basis
2912310 todays one of the few times this year same story but i felt like i actually made pitches today that got hit
2912311 up here you expect them to hit mistakes and when you dont make a mistake with a pitch and it still gets hit it makes it that much harder to swallow i guess
2912312 today was actually a confidence booster i went out and threw a lot of quality pitches that like i said got hit
2912313 i dont think anyone ever catches that with two fingers on the ball youre kind of throwing with your whole hand i definitely wish i would have made a better throw it kind of short hopped tek
2912314 seemed like every time theres a hit or an error it was followed up by pretty solid contact
2912315 i think the term probably used a few times is stopping the bleeding or limiting the damage thats been the hardest thing
2912316 i just think and we keep saying experience is going to be big for this kid and right now hes experiencing just about everything
2912317 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2912318 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2912319 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2912320 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2912321 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2912322 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2912323 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2912324 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2912325 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2912326 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2912327 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2912328 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2912329 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2912330 ive said it before there were times i didnt know if i was going to be playing anymore i honestly didnt know
2912331 there were some scary times too those are all behind me now hopefully i came out of it feeling good and im just really really happy now
2912332 he was getting stiffer and stiffer as the game progressed
2912333 it was getting harder to get loose he was still throwing great which has been kind of hard hard to put it together because hes been so effective
2912334 were trying to not have this thing get to a point where it did last year we kind of got in land there missing two starts is not what were shooting for but pitching half speed for the last 10 isnt either
2912335 its been bothering me for like four days now it didnt get better saturday it got a little worse so i just needed a day to try to calm it down a little bit hopefully ill be ready today
2912336 im feeling comfortable pitching just happy to get out there when its my day whats been nice is ive been able to start to feel a lot more comfortable just get some control of the pitches some good defensive plays jed lowrie and mike lowell it makes it fun

2912388 theres no switch that says process this differently because its on a screen
2912389 took out her frustrations and emotions on me and that she shouldnt have done that
2912390 im actually impressed that she apologized its a rare enough thing that she deserves credit
2912391 ill give her the benefit of the doubt about frustration making her a bit irrational as well i know ive snapped at things i really should not have when under a lot of stress
2912392 you know i was a bit hasty maybe those folks are right you know they were right atheists are really just one more step removed from my view on other religions and deserve the rights of the first amendment too i think ill call and offer my sincere apology and repudiate my statements nah i wont go that far
2912393 i would never allow an african american in my house
2912394 and her knee jerk reaction was to blame atheists what a total tool im sure shes a credit to whatever district she represents
2912395 i just snorted four lines of coke and watched six hours of c span
2912396 put a devil worshipping islamic gay pagan global warming universal healthcare curse upon
2912397 something tells me that she would sooner juggle flaming chainsaws while gargling gershwin on live television than do something like that posted by stanton
2912398 why yes i lie a lot and when the dark ages come we will have a short touching ceremony with you and a stack of firewood and wave good bye now why is that a problem
2912399 the nasty thing that happened made the prejudice and bigotry jump into my head
2912400 i fucked up i have no excuse my bad entirely
2912401 but however irrational you may see some on here as being there is one huge difference that being that none here are representing their constituents all their constituents while seeing some of those constituents as being citizens not only unworthy of the protection of the constitution but actually trying to deny them that protection on a political stage
2912402 i dont care if a politician doesnt like atheists only that they treat atheists with respect
2912403 i was wrong in my thinking and atheists arent dangerous i needed some education
2912404 if pz myers and company want to do something they should use their millions to help people out
2912405 who is he must be a king how can you tell doesnt have shit all over him

2912408 refrain from touching fire poison arrow frogs or female wolverines suffering from pms
2912409 what you have to spew and spread is extremely dangerous its dangerous for our children to even know that your philosophy exists this is the land of lincoln where people believe in god get out of that seat you have no right to be here we believe in something you believe in destroying you believe in destroying what this state was built upon
2912410 i was wrong for suggesting that children should not hear about atheism such knowledge is not a danger to them this is a secular country where people of different belief systems have the same rights atheists have just as much right to be part of the political process as christians this state was built upon the constitution and i accept that atheists dont want to destroy that
2912411 im sorry for my language i had just found out that someone had pilfered funds from my bank account
2912412 in any of the european countries i know well enough to say for sure ireland uk sweden she would have been forced to resign probably within 48 hours
2912413 what exactly is she scared of why exactly do people like her hate us so much
2912414 yes but are you a protestant atheist or a catholic atheist
2912415 i want to extend my sincerest apologies to rob sherman to the people of this great state of illinois and to all americans for the remarks i made to rob sherman during his testimony before the house state government administration committee my outburst was inexcusable i apologize to those i hurt i reaffirm the rights of all citizens to petition their government whether they profess a faith or no faith and i pray that i can understand and overcome the fear that led to this regrettable outburst let this incident give us the opportunity to reach out to each other in understanding and in hope and strengthen our commitment to the principles of freedom this country was founded upon thank you
2912416 i done fucked up need to really rethink this whole hating on atheists thing and im sorry i spat on my public office yall
2912417 e ven if there was evidence for god you are never going to see it
2912418 educators and scientists are being ridiculed denied tenure and even fired for the crime of merely believing that there might be evidence of design in nature and that perhaps life is not just the result of accidental random chance
2912419 a theory that attempts to empirically detect if the apparent design in nature acknowledged by virtually all biologists is genuine design or the product of an intelligent cause
2912420 dull artless amateurish too long poorly constructed and utterly devoid of any style wit or subtlety
2912421 they sent me an absolute torrent of information some of which i read some of which frankly i did not read
2912422 it just became a gigantically bigger project than i even had the slightest clue it was going to be
2912423 i have no suggestions whatsoever what to replace darwinism with none at all period
2912424 i just would like the floodgates of discussion to be opened
2912425 he said that this whole subject of evolution and where life came from and how it evolved is so complicated that for a human being with our paltry intelligence to try to answer it is like a dog trying to understand newtons physics
2912426 we keep discussing it more or less indefinitely and let each man think and hope as he wishes i think thats pretty good advice
2912427 sorry honey i didnt mean to beat the shit out of you but i was drunk and had a bad day at work
2912428 im sorry for calling the cops when i saw you standing on the corner waiting for the bus mr black man but i just heard on the radio that a woman had been assaulted a few miles from here so im sure you can understand where i was coming from
2912429 there were romans there there were jews there there were no norweigians there
2912430 my dads views are crazy but hes my dad and i love him so while im not going to defend him i refuse to publically denounce him for us its a private matter
2912431 yes but are you a protestant atheist or a catholic atheist
2912432 the bigoted remarks arent even the point the attempt by a legislative member to deny a citizen his or her rights as a citizen is the point
2912433 there is no such thing as a god only in the minds of the deranged
2912434 even if there is a god you are not going to see it
2912435 because if you believe in a world view that there is no god you will ignore the obvious and look for what you want to look for
2912436 we really dont want an apology from the likes of someone who thinks what she said the other day
2912437 i was wrong for suggesting that children should not hear about atheism such knowledge is not a danger to them this is a secular country where people of different belief systems have the same rights atheists have just as much right to be part of the political process as christians this state was built upon the constitution and i accept that atheists dont want to destroy that
2912438 many christians figure that anything is excusable so long as you do it in jesus name
2912439 well that does seem to be about where your education left off off you go then
2912440 pz myers and dawkins can only show scientific evidence from their godless point of view of the world which is actually totally useless for me anyway
2912441 it has nothing to do with rob sherman or atheists in general
2912442 yet evolution which cannot be observed and is not proven

2912492 i heard sir brian say he wants to give it to the ordinary people i think he was referring to gordon brown
2912493 his colleague suggested the extra cash could go to the needy but he replied no a fuel rebate for everybody on child benefit
2912494 britain faces yet more confusion on the back of this new speculation about the governments plans
2912495 if gordon brown had acted prudently and put money aside for a rainy day during the good years as all our competitors did he wouldnt be floundering now floating all sorts of ideas that he doesnt know how to pay for

2912499 in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out thats what autism is

2912503 the picture does not look like improving in the latter part of 2008 and first time buyers will find their path to home ownership increasingly blocked
2912504 auctions are the sharp end of the housing market where real deals show the prices paid by real buyers the published house price indices are well behind the game
2912505 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2912506 i dont want to be at the wrong end of another investigation report describing the deaths of babies and mother
2912507 i have been there too many times theres no reason we should see that any longer
2912508 how can they know what they are doing this is not how a modern 21st century large enterprise should conduct itself
2912509 this seems excessive and there is clearly a need to increase the capacity of delivery beds in these units
2912510 shower facilities are more common and more than a third of trusts 38 per cent reported one shower per delivery room with just over half of units reporting one shower or more for every two delivery rooms
2912511 ideally all delivery rooms should have a bath or shower room en suite but there is clearly a long way to go before this position is reached
2912512 but in practice the choice of types of maternity unit is currently very limited because our review found that about two thirds of trusts 65 per cent had only obstetric units
2912513 the remaining trusts had combinations of obstetric and midwife led units either alongside the main unit or midwife led units in separate freestanding premises a few trusts had all three kinds of unit two acute trusts had midwife led units only
2912514 labour talk about more choice for pregnant women but the reality is that women now have less choice its worrying that many more maternity units are set to be downgraded in the next few years and that so many neonatal units are set to shut
2912515 this unacceptable level of care must be addressed as a matter of priority staff shortages are putting midwives under an increasing amount of pressure and many women are not receiving good enough care

2912521 insects store fat like mammals do as lipid droplets accumulated in the fat body the functional equivalent of both mammalian liver and white adipose tissue
2912522 drosophila share many components of fat biosynthesis degradation and regulation with humans including many of those implicated in diabetes and obesity
2912523 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2912524 i think the tempo of operations has produced such a level of stress on the families that it is no wonder so many are thinking of leaving
2912525 but as soon as he left the senators began to worry over the budget projections they will get an updated forecast from economists on tuesday no one seemed to expect the forecast to show the nearly 400 million surplus first projected
2912526 it appears the senate could pass the governors health care proposal it is rather modest now that would give them reason for a short session and avoid them coming in and simply adjourning if there is a small surplus maybe they use it for medicaid expansion that money is matched three to one by the federal government
2912527 despite some reports to the contrary we fully support our earlier position in a letter that the secretary of states office needs to tell the new mexico youth organization nmyo to immediately comply with the law

2912533 these are the women that paved the way for me
2912534 looking on this court seeing nykesha sales and cynthia cooper i am just so grateful for what they did for the sport
2912535 when we were young we didnt know we would ever be able to play professionally
2912536 now young girls everywhere can have that dream its really special to be a part of that
2912537 i am so lucky that i got to grow up with goals to play basketball that i got to really put my all into it and work hard knowing that my dream was actually possible
2912538 i get to see them this weekend doing what they can to help out the sport and i got to play on the same court with some of them before so i think this is just a really cool event
2912539 i think they are doing a really good thing giving their time like this and raising money it makes me proud to be a basketball player and i hope i can contribute like this in my career too
2912540 we can do a lot for our community and for the youth of the area
2912541 its not a major oil producer but there are major transport links to europe through that region

2912547 while the u s economy has avoided recession to date the major economies are experiencing a generalized slowdown
2912548 weaker demand in the major economies coupled with the need to contain inflationary pressures will dampen growth in the fast growing asia economies
2912549 we are already down 25 basis points due to easing inflation expectations
2912550 yields should range trade after that unless we see a further drop in oil prices
2912551 i think right now the market is pricing in a 25 basis point hike after that the market is slowly ruling our more rate hikes because of improving oil prices
2912552 we have recorded one killed in action and 10 wounded from our troops as of this monday morning
2912553 but the military has information that there are also heavy casualties on their milf side
2912554 we have sufficient stocks of basic necessities for the evacuees
2912555 they milf are resisting heavily they would like to make it firm that they should be in those lands
2912556 law enforcement operations will not cease until the five towns are cleared
2912557 the guidance is to apply proportionate and justifiable force if the ground commander thinks that they will need to call for fire they will call for fire but this is not sustained and continuous bombing and shelling
2912558 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2912559 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2912560 have grossly violated the contracts by converting the timberland into agri business plantations such as pineapple sugarcane and jathropa production
2912561 on atienzas birthday we wish him to have a vision for the poor being the head of the governments environment office may he be an instrument in our effort to have access and security over the land
2912562 if pro poor programs are the centerpiece of denr we are hopeful that secretary atienza will prioritize our cbfm proposal
2912563 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2912564 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2912565 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2912566 the dollar buying seems a bit overdone but the dollar is still rallying against the majors
2912567 we are looking for a rally towards p44 50 p45 00 levels in the near term following a near term bottom at last weeks low at p43 76
2912568 the low yielding currencies from open economies most leveraged to global growth are taking the brunt of the impact while less cyclical fx that also benefit from the oil price decline are being impacted the least
2912569 with positions still relatively flat and growth concerns rising near term momentum remain for these moves
2912570 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2912571 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2912572 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2912573 please the god i hate please give me strength im starting to hope for my innocence
2912574 she kept telling me she cant do this and she cant do that
2912575 they locked the door on me and got the sandwiches i paid for in their store
2912576 she never stated shed make my sandwich the way i wanted her to
2912577 so she woke up she woke up from where she was lying still said i i gotta do something about where im going
2912578 red lips press against a glass drink the purple wine and the soul shall dance
2912579 but the difference is youre just coming in and im already on my way out
2912580 dont let him cut my hand off the doctor when he comes dont let him sister
2912581 no more fucking robots no more fucking space ships and ray guns this shit is real
2912582 wow that was quite an explosion at the end there but i feel the tension has essentially dissipated
2912583 tune in next week to see if mark greene is still a basically decent but hapless dork just trying to figure things out
2912584 im sorry what make a counterclockwise circle with the right hand flat over the heart ok lady you keep the bananas coming and im on it
2912585 oh tell me more about that oh my thats interesting
2912586 why a cake who really wants this cake would they rather have a torte who am i to dictate the flavor and consistency why am i the one to make the little buttercream roses and to pipe on the decorative trim why my cake at all when there are so many professionally made cake options available to people these days
2912587 now come on tom youve come this far just poke around a little more and youll find your way through and be done with injun joe in the process
2912588 i think in general people really like to read short things
2912589 good god short is easy to read and this website proves it
2912590 its very hard to know do they understand death do they really have any kind of conception of god or the soul
2912591 i heard an expression the other day that i think might apply here and i dont know maybe youve heard it get over it
2912592 to me that means that there are all these things in life you can control like if you want to learn french you take french lessons or if you dont like your house you can get a new one or paint it or whatever and then there are all these things you cant control like the weather or in your case whether you have a girl or a boy and these things you just have to get over you know get over it
2912593 usually when an eye moves the image of a stationary object shifts across the back of the eye the so called retina images of moving objects also undergo some retinal slippage since visual tracking following an object with the eye tends to be imperfect when retinal slippage is eliminated that is when the image is continually projected onto the same part of the retina by a contact lens attached to the cornea subjects see parts of the image disappear ultimately the image vanishes completely people become functionally blind to retinally stabilized images italics mine the light sensitive cells in the retina fatigue or adapt rapidly if they are continually stimulated in an unchanging fashion the motion of the eye prevents this fatigue or adaptation
2912594 forget about mr wright lets talk about obama and me
2912595 weve got two great democratic candidates in this race i believe that american would be well served with mr obama in the white house but i believe that i will do a better job and that i am a better choice for the following reasons
2912596 the senators son and the presidents son is this really the best the country has to offer
2912597 these last eight years have been something of a national nightmare never has a country been so prosperous and so powerful never has that prosperity been so squandered never has that power been so misused 9 11 was our national tragedy but it was also our challenge and our opportunity we couldve lead the world we couldve risen above the hate and built connections around the globe instead look where we are isolated at war without a plan for the very real dangers that are around us without a national goal our principles in tatters thats why i decided to run for president to lead the country back to the things that have always made us great and that is why today i am throwing my support behind barack obama i believe he can lead this country forward and as of today i will work as hard for him as i have worked for my own candidacy in life no matter what you lose you always have your hopes and dreams i have dreamed of being your president but today i realize that my hopes for myself are nothing compared to my hopes for this country if you support me if you believe in me then join me in this quest we set out to bring dignity principle and leadership back to the white house and that is exactly what we will do when we elect barack obama as our president
2912598 who moved so slow with white faced oxen in a heavy cart it seemed no harm to stop him altogether
2912599 theres a brook that starts up on it somewhere ive heard say right on the top tip top a curious thing
2912600 but theres the spring right on the summit almost like a fountain that ought to be worth seeing
2912601 now why shouldnt there be a brook on the summit of a mountain ive seen springs that bubble up under pressure and pressure can move water uphill and the earths core is certainly the domain of great forces and water comes from the earth so why not
2912602 i guess theres no doubt about its being there i never saw it it may not be right on the very top it wouldnt have to be a long way down to have some head of water from above and a good distance down might not be noticed by anyone whod come a long way up
2912603 one time i asked a fellow climbing it to look and tell me later how it was
2912604 he said there was a lake somewhere in ireland on a mountain top
2912605 i dont suppose the waters changed at all you and i know enough to know its warm compared with cold and cold compared with warm but all the funs in how you say a thing
2912606 it looks good it tastes good but after you skin it there aint much to it
2912607 i believe the children are our future teach them well and let them lead the way
2912608 youre wasting your time and youre damaging my crew i wont have it
2912609 an old service buddy of mine is chief on the monarch
2912610 you might give him a call give him my regards
2912611 hey what about these extra sheets of graphite carbon composite
2912612 what were you expecting sir if i might be so bold as to ask
2912613 i dunno something cooler something that touches me something ive never seen before
2912614 i can expect something ive never seen before its your job to deliver amazing shit
2912615 i thought this was amazing its a spaceship that is uhm invisible to other spaceships
2912616 i just thought i dunno this could be amazing and just blow people away but gawd i dunno its just this black lump of a spaceship just sitting there and it makes me sad you know when i think about what it coulda been
2912617 compromise compromise is weakness compromise is fear when we put our passion into our work we pursue art not compromise
2912618 no tears in the poet no tears in the poem
2912619 the first time i tried to sing along with my guitar
2912620 everybody in the studio booed they said it wouldnt work
2912621 im gonna sing along with my guitar and i defy you not feel it
2912622 well you got down there and back in one piece
2912623 who calls up and announces himself as stan the third
2912624 i believe the children are our future treat them well and let them lead the way
2912625 ive seen things you people wouldnt believe attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion i watched c beams glitter in the dark near the tannhauser gate
2912626 i know that if i dont get that heart this man is going to die ok well call me if anything changes
2912627 hi dr greene thanks for holding ive looked through our database and we dont have a match right now im sorry
2912628 and i would give it to you instantly if we had it because that after all is our whole business over here at the transplant bank
2912629 if i dont get that heart this man is going to die
2912630 dr greene ive checked the database ive asked around the office im looking under my desk right now we are tapped out over here
2912631 thats just what i just said what he hung up on me whatd i do
2912632 is the embodiment of everything were trying to communicate in this campaign
2912633 i know that youve got a lot of heart for this ad
2912634 yeah but ive got heart for it because its really great
2912635 well you know i didnt want to do the ad with the wildebeest and we gave you that one
2912636 ok but what im saying is you kinda went with us on the wildebeest maybe you do that again and you surprise yourself
2912637 we looked at your echo and if we dont find a donor heart you probably wont make it through the night mr gasner
2912638 without a transplant you may not make it through the night
2912639 its two in the morning im dying the least you can do is call me sam this is no time for formality
2912640 thats exactly what people expect me to do so i wont do it did fitzgerald write what they expected did dickens did uhm fucking faulkner or whoever
2912641 and neither will i i will do the opposite of what is expected i will do the unexpected thats it now whats the least expected thing possible here hmmm maybe we bring in a wildebeest no no thats just silly lets just have him sit there and do nothing
2912642 you feel crummy waiting around for a kid to smash up his car so you can get his heart
2912643 im not ready damn it im not i dont want to leave them sarah needs me
2912644 so when the baby is as old as you are now youll be ninety
2912645 is because its just uhm its scary to hope too much
2912646 i know abby i know i might not make it but something happened to me in that icu room i realized i dont want to die and more than that i dont want my little girl to watch me die i cant do that to you not ever thats what i wanted to tell you today
2912647 i was much younger than you when i had my first manic episode ive watched you since you were a little girl youre not bi polar
2912648 but they might not be they could be anything and you would just love them
2912649 oh sweetie thats all there is is risk you just have to take a chance and leap into life otherwise sweetheart youre going to miss out on all the great things
2912650 my son lincoln no laughter no fights no time to teach him anything at all
2912651 its the new series silly you knew that i dont even know if the old one is out on dvd
2912652 no but it hasnt been the same since he left hasnt maintained the same standards
2912653 in fact i stopped watching it the moment they let him go
2912654 you know my man has a show he watches religiously
2912655 if you interrupt him or bother him while the show is on forget about it
2912656 gawd i know hes very serious about it arent you its that space thing battleship galactica
2912657 battles tar galactica is the most insightful honest unflinching commentary of the current state of american foreign policy and the deterioration of american values in the world today nobody nobody is shining a spotlight on the hypocrisy of this administration and its criminal disregard for constitutional values for human life for chrissakes with anything like the courage and passion of this show

2912660 telah sampai kepadaku bahwa sahabatmu telah bersikap keras terhadapmu marilah bergabung bersama kami kami akan memberikan keluasan kepadamu
2912661 belumkah datang waktunya bagi orang orang yang beriman untuk tunduk hati mereka mengingat allah dan kepada kebenaran yang telah turun kepada mereka dan janganlah mereka seperti orang orang yang sebelumnya telah diturunkan al kitab kepadanya kemudian berlalulah masa yang panjang atas mereka lalu hati mereka menjadi keras dan kebanyakan diantara mereka adalah orang orang yang fasik
2912662 the test is a measure of long term glucose control but doctors dont typically use it to screen for or diagnose the disease theres reason to believe it could help identify many of the estimated six million people in the u s who have diabetes but dont know it
2912663 if a patient is scheduled for a physical he or she may tune up by changing their regimen for a few days and throw off their test results causing doctors to miss the patients usual pattern of high blood sugar
2912664 we respect a simple rule our freedom stops where others begins
2912665 the system implemented in a country such as lebanon is really good major brands that are respectable and accountable cannot afford any cheap provocation anyway and small brands with no equity are kept from disturbing the country
2912666 we get an answer within two hours and we usually have no more than five rejections and five modification requirements per year
2912667 its usually not a blatant flat out rejection i used to work in saudi arabia where they would hand us a booklet telling us precisely what we could and couldnt do here its more like guys be careful this might cause an issue so we anticipate any time we feel we have something racy or controversial we have a sense of what will or wont pass so we call them and ask if it can fly or not
2912668 the cleavage was showing slightly too much so we had to play with it to get it to pass through censorship
2912669 beyond sex and religion we can pretty much put anything out there given all the dynamics lebanon is a good place to communicate and do advertising
2912670 some specialized publications dealing with sensitive topics such as religion politics and the military this often has to do with israel must be presented to the censorship office for approval
2912671 there are no official bans but we might not be granted permission to distribute them as for other titles its up to us
2912672 if we dont receive it we dont distribute them this only happens around four or five times a year
2912673 it is quite evident that the danish caricatures of the prophet mohammed wouldnt be received well here we just have to use common sense whats tolerated in western countries could create tremendous and pointless tensions in a country without political stability
2912674 you want to avoid using religion because even if censorship allows it its tricky
2912675 from a pure branding perspective you simply dont want to go into that in such a religiously charged and sectarian country its not a smart thing to do if its a message of unity to promote peaceful cohabitation thats excellent for a brand but if its something that pokes fun at a religion it wont work
2912676 we think national but for the exotica campaign for instance the client only has stores in certain areas
2912677 the bulk of his retail business is in beirut so its not an issue but if we had to put ads in the suburbs we would definitely be scratching our heads a million times before doing that
2912678 we abide by the blacklist established in 1973 by the arab league with regards to israel
2912679 other than that only pornographic movies are forbidden lebanon is much freer than most countries in that regard
2912680 its easy to cut films as we did for the name of the jewish producer of charlies angels for instance
2912681 but we cannot do it on dvds this is ridiculous as in most cases illegal copies of the same movies are available on the street for less than a dollar or simply on cable tv
2912682 we dont necessarily ask for the end of censorship when its well implemented and applied to everybody
2912683 people have gotten on my lane line and sucked off of me so i figured this is the one opportunity in my whole career to do that
2912684 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
2912685 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
2912686 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
2912687 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
2912688 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
2912689 the commercial real estate game doesnt work without debt and it is very hard to come by these days on attractive terms
2912690 there is a notable decline in tenant demand but you still have rents at their peak rates
2912691 if things dont change in the economy or things get worse rents will have to go down
2912692 its so rare to have two in a relatively short period of time there they may still be there or they may have moved on already
2912693 they literally charged into the waffle house store in broad daylight
2912694 we were surprised at their brazenness and the level of violence
2912695 weve seen these robberies in the past it appears to be cyclical
2912696 we see them come through houston then perhaps they get frightened by law enforcement and media attention then they move on to other cities but well see them circle back in time
2912697 they see you catching the bad guys putting them away and they feel more comfortable that the terrorists arent going to come back that youre going to be there to protect them it isolates the terrorists
2912698 we did more to win the counterinsurgency with our cerp dollars than we did with our weapons
2912699 it was an iconic symbol to try to reopen the ceramics plant
2912700 it meant a return of normalcy it was a psychological impact
2912701 who has a story about how they got here this morning
2912702 there was a lot more early stage talent and ideas than there were vehicles to get them going
2912703 we said theres really an opportunity to create a destination for cutting edge talent and ideas in this region
2912704 will the technology work and will the market emerge thats the quintessential question
2912705 is it going to work and is it going to matter
2912706 its going to hem in the fed its going to be harder for the fed to weaken what theyve proposed
2912707 it sends a message that you did the right thing
2912708 the fed is going to act and is going to establish a new baseline for consumer protection that everyone will follow
2912709 we hope they will consider the impact this will have on pricing in the marketplace and the big question of whether or not low risk consumers are going to have to subsidize people who pose a higher risk

2912730 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety still to identify this first candidate for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
2912731 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic make up to treat anxiety disorders
2912732 we used the startle reflex because its a very old evolutionary indication of anxiety its not something you can manipulate or fake the startle response is stronger when they were watching a negative image and there was a significantly greater startle response from the met met women compared with the rest of the group
2912733 anxiety is a very complex phenomenon and many genes are responsible for it but this particular genetic variation although involved in a small part of the anxiety response is an essential part of it
2912734 it may give us a hint for drug therapy but the brain is very complex

2912739 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2912740 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2912741 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation

2912775 people in the galveston area should not miss this opportunity to see it and to participate by sharing their stories
2912776 if you say one more word im going to dump that plate of food right on your head
2912777 um excuse me i believe i ordered the lyonaise potatoes with my dinner this is a baked potato

2912781 everytime i look at the stars now i shall think about you
2912782 what we would be looking to do with any form of original content is the added component that zune could provide that
2912783 the thing weve all been looking for is what can we do that is a little more interesting than just looking at a piece of video
2912784 regardless of when they sign up they get a job
2912785 in order to run a successful program youve got to have parameters
2912786 you cant continue to add to the program and expect it to go off like clockwork
2912787 the idea of enrolling as many teens as possible and then figuring out how to pay for it violates the basic principles of budgeting deciding how much to spend and then sticking with it
2912788 air fare costs a lot more than the bandwidth needed to post your precious neo soul mp3s
2912789 you cant fly first class to a country halfway around the world without telling me first and then ask for a reimbursement since 1 thats completely unprofessional and inconsiderate and 2 you didnt even ask me to go with you you arrogant son of a bitch
2912790 i love you and i thank you for putting up with all my nonsense even the stuff youll never find out about unless you pry it from my cold dead mouth
2912791 can the current russian authorities be called adequate strategic partners of the eu and second
2912792 a litmus test for the credibility of the eu and nato to solve the conflict and to prove for all eu and nato members aspirant countries and democratic partners that it is worth being members and partners of these organizations
2912793 investors do find comfort with public sector ipos since most of the companies are long standing and price reasonably
2912794 names such as bsnl and oil india are quite well known
2912795 going by the past the government should be able to give attractive pricing
2912796 we have done enough issues in the past in a short time and we can do it again
2912797 there is no question that microsofts products have produced enormous profit along with providing broad social benefit around the world
2912798 der kapitalismus zerst rt die sch tzenden sozial und herrschaftssysteme sodass sein zerfall unabwendbar ist und er einem lebensf higen sozialismus platz machen wird
2912799 this is a voting block that has never been open before and it has opened up at such a time as this
2912800 the majority of people to get their rights restored are democrats and if we get them registered we might overtake the state
2912801 could certainly swing an election but there are millions and millions of voters
2912802 theres also the perception for some reason that they are all black and all democrats and thats certainly not the case
2912803 it kind of offended my notion of justice you can serve your time and still have your rights taken away
2912804 i studied the history of black disenfranchisement in the state we had the grandfather laws and the tissue paper ballots when a black man came to vote they gave him a tissue paper ballot that was later thrown out there were lynchings and riots weve got a long history of depriving people of the right to vote in florida
2912805 i thought my god what do i have to do to beat this guy it was discouraging
2912806 it took me the entire first round to adjust to it and by that time i could barely see out of my eye
2912807 i feel like i let people down my teammates my friends my family i had a lot of people come up here tonight they dont have a lot of money but they still came up here to support me and i let them down and i feel bad about that
2912808 fitch is such an amazing fighter and he showed incredible heart and courage tonight

2912810 ill give a shot to anyone who deserves im not like champions in other sports who duck challenges i wont duck people i have courage and will not be afraid to fight anybody
2912811 after the fighting in the city we found several bodies of citizens of the baltic states and ukraine later on i was informed that the bodies of several black men were found at the scene of a battle near school number 12
2912812 in yesterdays attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to have black skin possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet we will be able to publish the official conclusions after carrying out special tests

2912817 a jury consists of twelve persons chosen to decide who has the better lawyer
2912818 obviously things like that will take time to sink in
2912819 at the moment im just enjoying the pga win for the pga win i really did like the fact that no other european has won two majors consecutively i hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special to me

2912823 there is a caesura between the two types of art but when you place them together and thats what weve done in this exhibition then it tells that there is a story there even if people are looking at life differently and the values are sometimes changed theres a whole continuity to the story
2912824 is folk art a form of expression that just anyone can produce
2912825 i put on some music and make my pencil dance
2912826 folk art is more philosophical than technical at the same time folk art is simple the way life should be you need a certain amount of life experience
2912827 the immediate prospect was for a sharp increase in inflation which was already above the target and sluggish output the key challenge for policy was to balance those conflicting risks
2912828 it is ironic that the great cartier bresson who took thousands of photographs of unsuspecting people in his work hangs in the museum while a photographer practicing the same type of work gets ejected
2912829 peterson hawk has crossed the line a rational human being would have simply written a letter to museum management stating his case and asking for the situation to be put right peterson hawk has instead savaged simon blints online reputation which is guaranteed to hurt his employment prospects for years to come
2912830 sf moma has yet to present its side of the story whereas peterson hawk can skewer blint at his leisure blint has a chain of command he must work through before he can defend himself
2912831 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2912832 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2912833 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2912834 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2912835 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2912836 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2912837 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2912838 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2912839 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2912840 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2912841 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2912842 there was massive bombing of gori all evening and now we are getting reports of an imminent attack by russian tanks

2912852 pana la urma lucrurile nici nu sunt atat de stuporante cata vreme discutam de o banca centrala care a girat cu zambetul pe buze aparitia si apoi ingroparea unor banci fara a incerca cu eficienta evitarea crizelor bancare

2912861 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
2912862 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colors our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem
2912863 to be honest hindi pa nag sink in sabi ko sa kapatid ko hindi ko pa din maisip na ganyan na pala ang nangyari kay charlie i didnt really feel it yet all this whats happening to him now

2912865 we always told him that whenever somebody will approach you you have to be very very good to them you have to give time to them you have to be very good since they are the ones who put you there

2912875 unless we act quickly the gap between the haves and the have nots will grow uncontrollably exacerbating existing inequalities and condemning millions more people to poverty
2912876 now it is clearer than ever that the only way to end the gross inequalities that have condemned more than a billion people to linger in poverty is through a massive redistribution of power assets and opportunities
2912877 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2912878 oh its going to be so hard to say goodbye i love you all too

2912882 usually i have to keep them pent up inside the house its nice to have a playground like this where the children can play somewhat at peace but its obviously not a solution to living with the rocket fire
2912883 i just want the rockets to stop for good so that we dont have to live for these little moments of quiet that are followed by terrible barrages of qassams
2912884 the cease fire is giving families especially parents and kids a chance to breathe a little
2912885 this is not a real calm however because we know the rocket fire will resume soon
2912886 most people anticipate another heavy round of rocket fire based on what happened in the last cease fire

2912907 i guess my time hasnt come ill just have to return to where i came from
2912908 yes its very wonderful that you all learn torah but you seem to have forgotten a crucial part of our mesorah
2912909 the first place to start is to shut up your mouths and open up your hearts

2912951 the continuation of a healthy technology sector in the uk requires talented and innovative young individuals intellects young professionals network gives them a forum in which to collaborate and promote their talents
2912952 it is exciting to see the network becoming so dynamic with young professionals taking the opportunity to lead on agendas pertinent to them members are motivated by each other and aspire to make a real difference to their organisations and industry
2912953 the network gives the team a real foundation for learning and personal development its amazing how much you can pick up from your peers we have a lot of innovative plans in the coming months which will diversify and grow the network
2912954 we are delighted that the committee has recognised that how information is used is as important as how it is gathered there is no use in creating information mountains without the ability to analyse and exploit the data for the frontline in basra in helmand and here at home the effective use of information and communication technology is critical to support our troops our security services and our allies
2912955 todays commission decision is a decisive step towards meeting the european goal of reducing road accidents getting critical messages through quickly and accurately is a must for road safety
2912956 we should also keep in mind that with 24 of europeans driving time spent in traffic jams the costs caused by congestion could reach 80 billion by 2010 so clearly saving time through smart vehicles communications systems means saving money

2912962 cyber risk is an unavoidable but very real part of the internet economy that has created new liabilities and business exposures
2912963 as web 2 0 is becoming more mainstream so are the business risks of privacy media and online advertising

2912969 i dont deny the two films sound similar although i havent seen 21 my script was written long before 21 was released so theres no question of me being inspired by the film
2912970 but we obviously made many changes for one we couldnt have the game of blackjack no one in india understands blackjack also the motivations had to change but yes like 21 and many other contemporary films teen patti is a study of materialism greed and acquisitiveness in our times
2912971 the delay was unfortunate but my producer ambika hinduja and i were very clear that mr bachchan was the films fulcrum everyones dates had to be adjusted according to his convenience now people will draw comparisons between teen patti and 21 but my film has nothing to do with blackjack
2912972 it do knot disturb is an out and out comedy lets not pretend about that but it is an original idea and script when david and i come together we cant fool around with peoples expectations
2912973 when govinda says he has full faith in me i get frightened will i be able to deliver again this time i cant say our film is spectacularly different from what weve done so far but at the same time i must admit audiences want to see something different
2912974 look at jannat its success is so welcome but i cant do something too different with govinda because i cant play around with audiences expectations
2912975 im simultaneously launching my son jackie in vivek sharmas kal kissne dekha while he will be shooting it in south africa ill be with david and the crew for do knot disturb in delhi
2912976 punjab chief minister parkash singh badal has assured us that a probe would be conducted into ishmeets death
2912977 i always find a reason to come back to theatre every time i get an opportunity
2912978 i am talking to veteran theatre personality barry john my mentor and guru who taught me theatre for seven years i would like to return to the stage with him since i am comfortable acting under his guidance i told barry a few days ago to think of a play in hindi in which we can team up together on stage
2912979 i have done my bit for the delhi stage i spent 11 years in the capital doing theatre for almost 18 hours a day
2912980 we were so engrossed with the stage and so happy that we almost forgot our dream of making it big in mumbai till of course shekhar kapur came to our rescue and reminded us that we had to pay our bills
2912981 we ashish vidyarthi piyush mishra and myself wanted to excel everyday and every hour piyush spent almost 10 years on the stage and ashish nearly seven years i do not have any regrets
2912982 i told them give some time to yourself there is no one to help them in mumbai no godfather and no uncle
2912983 but qualitatively it is as good in contrast western indian metropolises have a very commercial and vibrant gujarati stage because it caters to the masses
2912984 marathi theatre used to be good and experimental once upon a time with towering personalities like vijay tendulkar kolkata had equally good theatre but television has taken its toll people are now reluctant to leave the cushy comfort of their drawing room and their lcd and plasma television screens to watch theatres
2912985 i have come across so much talent on my journeys to native state bihar who cannot afford to come to delhi or mumbai
2912986 the media has a big role to play in popularising theatre
2912987 uljhaan and holi went on to become super hits i have also acted in brechts drums in the night directed by robin das
2912988 translating amrita pritams character into reality was tough because the character was so deeply rooted in literature and personally 1971 was the best film i have done till date

2913006 in the small to medium business space as well as the enterprise space public sector is a major strategy for us they are important customers and partners for us
2913007 we see a big opportunity and that is why we innovated on that line we want to get the message across that health is important as is education
2913008 coincidentally and perhaps not coincidentally the two major areas of interest for the rudd government coming in were health and education so we do see an opportunity there
2913009 the things i want to encourage is when they partners think about business opportunities is to also think about the impact on some of the social issues that we face
2913010 its one of the great things of australian business and where you get a lot of the best innovation
2913011 people have the entrepreneurial spirit in the country to innovate

2913054 pre season has been good actually it has been very different under jose we never did any running but with scolari we have had our trainers on and done 1 000 metres which is similar to the former managers gianluca vialli and claudio ranieri style of thinking and i feel great we are feeling good we are looking good and we are preparing well

2913060 ditte hat mir durch das anl cheln ein gutes gef hl geben da ist der funke dann auch bergesprungen

2913063 if the orientation is unchangeable then the critics should just laugh at the time and the money the researchers are wasting trying to prove the impossible
2913064 i also dont see why we should make a big fuss about a comment from a bigotted homophobe if that is indeed what the commenter is
2913065 history will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people but the appalling silence of the good people
2913066 i read no hint of bigotry in the original post in fact if anything maybe an overly sensitive version of the guys opinion was all i saw

2913078 this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight and i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
2913079 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
2913080 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
2913081 im excited its good to have him back in the house
2913082 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
2913083 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
2913084 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
2913085 but like i said its not the first time and it wont be the last time
2913086 if we played a game tomorrow aaron rodgers would be the starting quarterback
2913087 im not going to change any direction that weve gone with this football team based on the information i have here today thats part of our conversation tomorrow and we have all the confidence in the world in aaron
2913088 recuerdo que lo primero que vi fue un ser extra o que cuando hab a luna llena se pon a a aullar era notable porque empezaban todos los perros del sector a hacer lo mismo entonces era un concierto de aullidos maravilloso como para filmar a bela lugosi o para una cinta de kieslowski tambi n jugaba a ser el cuco pon a los ojos en blanco y nos persegu a nos asustaba de verdad
2913089 cre mos que se lo hab an comido los animales
2913090 for every animal you dont eat im going to eat three more
2913091 what we would be looking to do with any form of original content is the added component that zune could provide that
2913092 the thing weve all been looking for is what can we do that is a little more interesting than just looking at a piece of video
2913093 were going to smash them thats what we came for
2913094 if we get to a four degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
2913095 i dont know about georgia or ossetia but a lot of investors are lining up to surrender
2913096 russia has gone from being perceived as a safe haven for investment with a large foreign reserve exposure to commodity prices and a booming economy to being perceived as a risky asset class in the space of a month
2913097 however we think that with fundamentals remaining solid asset prices are due a rebound within a matter of days
2913098 last weeks attack on mechels pricing behaviour by putin and the lasting tnk bp saga found a bloody next act in a screenplay that could be named how to destroy the investment story of one of the strongest credits in the emerging markets universe
2913099 your subconscious is active right now it feels weird but youre getting smarter
2913100 oh hecate i am not sorry for having betrayed you and i defend all my sins because of thy unjust punishment but most of all because they offend you who art all good and deserving of all my hate i firmly resolve with the help of your fallen to sin without mercy and to avoid forgiveness amen
2913101 hahaha jesus wasnt he a laugh riot rising from the dead what was he a zombie zombie christ
2913102 it takes a lot of courage to show your dreams to someone else
2913103 hopefully some peoples religious beliefs will be shattered because i have a green bible instead of a black bible
2913104 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
2913105 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
2913106 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
2913107 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
2913108 but as soon as the swimming was over and michael phelps didnt break my record every time i went to beach volleyball they put my face on the volleyballs
2913109 i knew id have to go close to my best and thats what i was hoping for obviously to swim as fast as i could to get the guys off to a good lead
2913110 it just felt like quite an easy swim there wasnt much pain involved although i faded a bit towards the end it wasnt painful
2913111 by no means is the next couple of days going to be easy
2913112 i think ive still got a lot of work to do and hopefully find some part of the race to improve on and if i can do that in my other races ill be happy
2913113 over the last four years ive never seen such a big amount of swimmers especially sprinters compete as much and as regularly against each other
2913114 i think thats a big part of where youve seen the depth grow immensely the times drop so steadily
2913115 theres been this group of guys swimming so fast for years race against each other
2913116 all these different series overseas all the big competitions theyre pushing each other to swim faster and faster all the time
2913117 people are just finding ways to do that and to keep bettering the world records and times and finding new ways to sprint
2913118 i think the suits help us feel good in the water
2913119 and if you feel good in the water you can do special things
2913120 i dont think they enhance performance at all it makes you more confident with the way youre feeling in the water
2913121 unbelievable jason finished that race way better than we could have even asked for
2913122 for that last 50 i was thinking this is going to be one close race
2913123 the last 10 to 15 metres were incredible i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional after that
2913124 when i saw the last 50 metres and i saw he was far ahead i thought no way
2913125 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
2913126 i think michael knows we didnt do this for him
2913127 he was a part of it and we were part of it
2913128 whether he wins eight medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen we all gave it our best efforts so we didnt come up short
2913129 im very happy they are the olympic champions so even when we had 20 points in the third game we could not take anything for granted it wasnt until we got that final point that we could celebrate
2913130 now we have a day off and we just hope to keep the momentum going
2913131 its okay we have thought this before losing we tried our best and have no regrets
2913132 i dont have time to maintain these regrets when i think about the way that he loves us
2913133 faith is not the absence of fear rather faith exists in the face of fear
2913134 i cant believe he did this to me he said i was different

2913261 chi crea il valore della moneta non chi la stampa ma il popolo che laccetta come mezzo di pagamento
2913262 i disordini non avranno mai fine non avremo mai una sana amministrazione della cosa pubblica se non acquisteremo una nozione precisa e netta della natura e della funzione del denaro
2913263 oggi il nome democrazia rimasto alle usurocrazie o alle daneistocrazie se preferite una parola accademicamente corretta ma forse meno comprensibile che significa dominio dei prestatori di denaro
2913264 discutere dei governi delle cos dette democrazie inghilterra francia stati uniti una semplice perdita di tempo sino a che non si distingue tra teoria e fatto questi tre paesi sono controllati dagli usurai sono usurocrazie o daneistocrazie ed perfettamente inutile parlarne come se fossero controllati e governati dai loro popoli o dai delegati che rappresentano i loro popoli o nellinteresse dei loro popoli
2913265 nelle colonie americane emettiamo la nostra moneta cartacea si chiama cartamoneta provvisoria coloniale colonial scrip la emettiamo nelle giuste proporzioni per produrre merci e farle passare facilmente dai produttori ai consumatori in questo modo creando noi stessi il nostro denaro cartaceo ne controlliamo il potere dacquisto e non abbiamo interessi da pagare a nessuno vedete un governo legittimo pu sia spendere che prestare denaro in circolazione mentre le banche possono soltanto prestare cifre considerevoli attraverso i loro biglietti di banca promissori per cui questi biglietti non si possono n dare n spendere se non per una piccola frazione di quelli che servirebbero alla gente di conseguenza quando i vostri banchieri in inghilterra mettono denaro in circolazione c sempre un debito fondamentale da restituire e unusura da pagare il risultato che c sempre troppo poco credito in circolazione per dare ai lavoratori una piena occupazione non si hanno affatto troppi lavoratori ma piuttosto pochi soldi in circolazione e quelli che circolano portano con s un peso senza fine di un debito impagabile e usura
2913266 lattivit bancaria fu fecondata dallingiustizia e nacque nel peccato i banchieri posseggono il mondo toglieteglielo via lasciando loro il potere di creare denaro e con un colpo di penna creeranno abbastanza depositi per ricomprarselo toglieteglielo via in qualsiasi modo e tutti i grandi patrimoni come il mio scompariranno ed necessario che scompaiano affinch questo diventi un mondo migliore in cui vivere ma se preferite restare schiavi dei banchieri e pagare voi stessi il costo della vostra stessa schiavit lasciate che continuino a creare denaro
2913267 il capitale deve proteggersi in ogni modo possibile con alleanze e legislazione i debiti devono essere riscossi le obbligazioni e i contratti ipotecari devono esser conclusi in anticipo e il pi rapidamente possibile quando mediante processi giuridici le persone comuni perderanno le proprie case diventeranno sempre pi docili e saranno tenute a freno con pi facilit attraverso il braccio forte del governo al potere azionato da una forza centrale di ricchezza sotto il controllo di finanzieri di primo piano questa verit ben conosciuta tra i nostri uomini di spicco adesso impegnati nel costituire un imperialismo del capitale che governi il mondo dividendo gli elettori attraverso il sistema dei partiti politici possiamo far spendere le loro energie per lottare su questioni insignificanti di conseguenza con unazione prudente abbiamo la possibilit di assicurarci quello che stato pianificato cos bene e portato a termine con tanto successo
2913268 se gli americani consentiranno mai a banche private di emettere il proprio denaro prima con linflazione e poi con la deflazione le banche e le grandi imprese che ne cresceranno attorno priveranno la gente delle loro propriet finch i loro figli si sveglieranno senza tetto nel continente conquistato dai loro padri il potere di emissione va tolto via dalle banche e restituito al popolo al quale esso appartiene propriamente
2913269 lo stato di diritto ha considerato nel proprio ordine costituzionale solo i tre poteri legislativo giurisdizionale ed esecutivo il quarto potere della sovranit monetaria se lo sono fagocitato nel silenzio le banche centrali s p a con scopo di lucro ecco perch dobbiamo completare la rivoluzione francese la sovranit monetaria va attribuita allo stato come quarto potere costituzionale e tolta alla banca centrale non pi tollerabile che in uno stato di diritto la funzione costituzionale della sovranit monetaria sia esercitata da una s p a con scopo di lucro lurlo del a ira deve tornare sulle piazze davanti alle sedi delle banche centrali e nei tribunali ci dobbiamo riprendere la propriet dei soldi nostri
2913270 no signor presidente su ognuno di quei biglietti che le ho stampato c scritto il valore corretto 20 lei quindi deve pagare 20 euro per ciascun biglietto
2913271 caro signor presidente lei sa bene di aver stipulato un contratto irrevocabile per cui solo io posso stampare i biglietti della sua squadra e quindi me li dovr pagare quanto voglio io se non ha soldi sufficienti in questo momento posso aiutarla cos le apro un debito nei miei confronti e lei mi pagher man mano che far profitti sulle vendite dei biglietti ma il tasso dinteresse lo scelgo io
2913272 io ho la soluzione ai nostri problemi col baratto e vi invito tutti domani ad una riunione pubblica
2913273 loro con cui modello ornamenti e gioielli un metallo eccellente non si scolora n si arruginisce e dura a lungo produrr alcune monete con loro e chiameremo dollaro ogni moneta
2913274 alcuni potrebbero scavare loro e farsi le monete da s
2913275 si potranno usare solo le monete approvate dal governo le quali avranno uno stampo speciale su di esse
2913276 senza il mio cibo non vivreste e certamente siamo noi contadini che dobbiamo averne di pi

2913278 dal momento che io sto fornendo un servizio che consiste nella fornitura di denaro ho titolo al pagamento per il mio lavoro diciamo che per ogni 100 pezzi che otterrete me ne dovrete ripagare 105 per ogni anno in cui mi dovete tale debito i 5 pezzi saranno la mia tariffa e chiamer questa tariffa interesse

2913297 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
2913298 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
2913299 whomever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind
2913300 members of the antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of far eastern nations in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there do they understand their responsibility today or do they prefer not to hear
2913301 when you play so nicely like this i think you deserve a big hug special treat extra privilege
2913302 if you dont settle down ill have to ask you to leave the room and return when you can stay here quietly
2913303 the shepherd doesnt leave his flock when the wolf comes
2913304 the ways of hashem are always good you know yaely about this we do not question
2913305 you are part of a good strong chain you know
2913306 she has died the good woman mrs lia waldman daughter of the nagybaner rav may her soul be entwined in the bouquet of life
2913307 here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six
2913308 lets not irritate the physicians or else theyre going to take their patients to another hospital
2913309 the number one issue in the errors that occur is bad communication
2913310 the scissors didnt cut to his liking he was trying to cut suture material he said they were dull he tossed them across the room one of the nurses had to dodge the scissors
2913311 these incidents happen because the or environment is so high stress
2913312 surgeons hold patients lives in their hands yet theyre dependent on equipment and people who are outside their control this incident was over a year ago and there has not been another incident with this physician
2913313 you have an industry in crisis where people are having to do much more with limited resources that combination can be a potent one
2913314 weve decided to do a five part mini series one big story that will run during one week
2913315 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2913316 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2913317 so rumor has it that the bbc was unhappy and russell had to rush to write her out of series 3
2913318 personally id be very happy if they didnt add any more principle characters between jack ianto and gwen there are plenty of possible stories to tell for a season thats only having a five episode run
2913319 ive seen some in car footage of the track and it looks very open for a street course theres some run off in some corners its quite flowing in places and its mostly fairly wide
2913320 aesthetically it looks more like an american style street circuit than monaco or macau because of the use of concrete walls rather than armco
2913321 but its only really when you touch it feel it and scratch it as you walk round on the thursday and then drive it for the first time in friday practice that you get a true idea of what a new circuit is like
2913322 one of the most purely entertaining hamlets i have ever seen
2913323 the doctor is scarred by losing his race he cant seem to hold on to anyone he is entirely alone even with the ones who do stick with him he is to all intents and purposes eternal thats his tragedy
2913324 its too easy to become defined by your press cuttings
2913325 im much happier going on a radio show and talking nonsense for 20 minutes i am an actor after all
2913326 he was 22 and had only just started acting yet his confidence and determination were extraordinary
2913327 often when we go out together large groups of women will visibly go weak at the knees
2913328 assume that growing up in a manse must be a puritanical existence
2913329 i was a junkie a doctor who junkie every saturday evening at 5 35 i could not be disturbed any noise or distinctive movement would be met with the wrath of a furious nine year old i was worshipping at the shrine
2913330 i didnt say a word to anyone apart from my doctor who doll
2913331 he was a very bright boy quick and witty he was an accomplished actor from early on
2913332 im the only scottish actor alive who hasnt been in taggart
2913333 you feel the weight of history there and its scary
2913334 wed established that we were both fans and he seemed the obvious choice i think david brings to it a fantastic sense of humour he can find lightness even in the darkest of scenes
2913335 its very unjust never once did i attempt to thrust atheism on these children i was scrupulously careful not to do that i was simply trying to persuade them to look at the evidence it was a pro evolution point rather than an anti religious point
2913336 i do get a bit exasperated at people hearing what they expect me to say rather than what i do say
2913337 perhaps the most powerful idea ever to occur to a human mind
2913338 we find no vestige of a beginning no prospect of an end
2913339 if you actually look at the god delusion including those bits people think are strident and shrill and so on i like to think theyre actually funny
2913340 a petty unjust unforgiving control freak a vindictive bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser a misogynistic homophobic
2913341 its a bit like the dilemma of a doctor who has a patient who has terminal cancer and the doctor has to decide whether to tell the truth or regard the patients private consolation as outweighing the truth if i were talking to an individual who had recently been bereaved i probably would hold my tongue in a way that i dont for anybody who chooses to read the book
2913342 you cant appreciate english literature for a start unless youre pretty knowledgeable about the bible if you dont understand what it means when someone alludes to
2913343 just glorious and its not just the music the drama of the passion of jesus as a work of fiction is something you can lose yourself in just as one can reading a novel you dont have to believe that heathcliff and cathy really existed to get caught up in the emotion
2913344 but if your main object is to understand how the universe works the question of whether or not theres a god in the universe is profoundly important
2913345 so i wouldnt wish to muzzle myself or anybody else for the sake of a skirmish in american schools about evolution
2913346 im bleeding i think we need to go to the hospital
2913347 theres some fluid around the sac that isnt supposed to be there
2913348 she just means she cant see the shape because of the extra fluid
2913349 there is a hole in the skull and the brain is not in the skull this baby is not going to live and you should terminate your pregnancy

2913480 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2913481 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2913494 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2913599 were anxious to get shawn back i cant wait till he gets back up here
2913600 you have to be right as a person before you can play football
2913601 thats what the issue is right now and something he has to deal with
2913602 im here to play football im not his family if he can play football hell play if he cant well move on
2913603 i just want to be on the field but if i had to choose a position id pick left tackle over guard
2913604 my main focus is to just keep taking steps forward no matter what position im playing if i want to hang around here for a while i have to do that
2913605 i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face
2913606 i want to make sure everything is set up for him here so he can be successful

2913610 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
2913611 im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going get back up here with the guys
2913612 we took him out and are just easing him back in
2913613 he feels good and i want to make sure he keeps feeling good
2913614 quite a few of the players know the situation and have been in communication with him
2913615 well address that down the road hes got some guys here that really care about him
2913616 he wants to come back im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going to get back up here with the guys

2913620 you cant put a timetable on what shawns going through
2913621 and thats one of the issues so weve got to prepare like hes not there and its kind of brutal but thats the way youve got to approach it if he can play football he can play if he cant then well move on youve got to be right as a person before you come out and play football thats what the issue is
2913622 i just want to be on the field but if i had to choose i would take tackle
2913623 let me rephrase that with tra out there id rather play guard but if tra is not going to be out there id rather play tackle i feel like its a little easier on your body you get to work a little more athleticism in than brute force but youve got to do a little more technique there and im a little rusty
2913624 i thought he played very well actually it will be another challenge for him there
2913625 mark omara had other engagements so he couldnt come down i like kyle ater and he listens to what you tell him

2913684 das ist sicher mein bisher gr ter erfolg und mein sch nster titel
2913685 habe ich damit wirklich allen gezeigt dass ich wieder voll da bin
2913686 gut f r mein selbstvertrauen und eine prima vorbereitung auf die qualifying school
2913687 das ist schlie lich eine der wenigen m glichkeiten mal die volle distanz ber vier runden zu spielen
2913688 ich bin sehr gut in form ich werde jedenfalls versuchen mich ber die qualifying school f r die 1 liga des profigolf zu qualifizieren
2913689 es ist gro artig dass es dieses turnier gibt und ich habe mich sehr gefreut endlich einmal dabei sein zu k nnen

2913703 i think they knew that history was being made sunday and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
2913704 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by over 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
2913705 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us

2913711 i ceased to advertise my mothers race at the age of 12 or 13 when i began to suspect that by doing so i was ingratiating myself to whites

2913717 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
2913718 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
2913719 whomever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind
2913720 members of the antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of far eastern nations in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there do they understand their responsibility today or do they prefer not to hear

2913729 the guys rode very strongly in the saturday night crit
2913730 tony and martin were in the breakaway that made it to the line
2913731 martin wasnt very happy with the racing conditions in the crit i think it is safe to say
2913732 but he didnt run away from the race at all on the contrary he rode it very aggressively and was at the front of the race the whole night
2913733 tony and i were in the lead group that had a 20 30 second lead on the main pack
2913734 in the final couple of laps tony worked really hard for me but in the final lap there were so many attacks and the road was so slippery that i came into the last corner only in 7th position i managed to pass three guys before the finish line
2913735 we were working to get martin on the podium but its so hard to race a crit in those conditions even if you are used to it
2913736 tony raced a very smart race and martin had a great sprint so the evening went fairly well for us
2913737 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
2913738 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
2913739 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
2913740 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
2913741 but as soon as the swimming was over and michael phelps didnt break my record every time i went to beach volley they put my face on the volleyballs
2913742 after 2004 my only target was to defend my title in beijing
2913743 getting a silver medal is already a very good consolation for me because i really worked hard for it
2913744 ive been through a lot of hardship and shed a lot of tears in the last four years there have been successes and failures
2913745 after 2004 my only aim has not changed i had so very much wanted to be a champion at the beijing olympics
2913746 in the last two rounds i made several mistakes because i had used up all my physical and mental energy
2913747 i was under tremendous pressure and at times i felt really agitated

2913754 in the last two rounds i made several mistakes because i had used up all my physical and mental energy
2913755 i wasnt thinking of making history i was two points behind the leaders i was just trying to shoot good shots i wanted to shoot well and shoot aggressively and thats what i did
2913756 it shows that shooting is a sport from the first to the final shot every one counts
2913757 i havent prayed so much in my life with the second last shot they tied together and then he bindra shot a 10 8 it couldnt have got better

2913761 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2913762 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2913763 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2913764 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2913765 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
2913766 as a communion we are going to continue to be in grave peril
2913767 we have not resolved the differences among us but have seen the need to maintain relationships even in the face of significant disagreement and discomfort
2913768 we cannot afford to wait while lesbian gay transgender and transsexual persons continue to be denied their civil and human rights
2913769 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
2913770 i dont think weve done anything to resolve the crisis

2913777 we are one with one another because we are called into union with the one christ and stand in his unique place stand in the way the truth and the life our unity is not mutual forbearance but being summoned and drawn into the same place before the fathers throne
2913778 seek for consistent practices around the sacraments so that the baptism or eucharist of each community can be recognised by others as directed in the same way working under the same authority
2913779 to change what has been received in faith from scripture and tradition
2913780 the practice and public language of the church acts always as a reminder that the onus of proof is on those who seek a new understanding
2913781 charitys power as an ensign to the nations is severely undermined and the archbishops later discussion of zimbabwes anglican witness as bound to the communions life was in this respect far more than a passing example permit and even further confusion and the calling of the gospel is ripped from the hands of the little ones for whom the kingdom is given
2913782 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward

2913811 oh yuck go home i just had it dont you dare give it to me
2913812 we had a wonderful visit with the president and he was very casual in his conversation
2913813 he spoke about his support of getting softball back on the olympic program he stood with me behind home plate while observing batting practice and he inquired about each player and where they were from
2913814 the entrance to the field was quite the spectacle he has a much bigger staff than i do following him around
2913815 he signed a softball to my fellow americans go win again
2913816 it was a lot of fun getting a chance before we lined up to mingle with the other u s athletes in the delegation also meeting the president wow just a crazy crazy night
2913817 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
2913818 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
2913819 i thought he was fabulous for a first time out here in this environment he did not look like a true freshman
2913820 the thing i have been most impressed with is he has come in and hasnt been scared at all hasnt been afraid to make mistakes
2913821 i didnt see anything that was disappointing to me his maturity and poise is way beyond his years
2913822 hes improving every day and obviously he can make some things happen hes a playmaker
2913823 when we get outside the pocket that messes up the tackles because they expect us to stay inside
2913824 that happened a couple of times last year when i did that to eben the thing with matt is that he can scramble but its hard for the line
2913825 bryson had a good day too and made good reads hes a good quarterback as well we will see
2913826 his composure thats one thing you dont see too much of from a freshman
2913827 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
2913828 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
2913829 real bad joses an unbelievable guy his injury is not an easy one
2913830 bermudez looked a little tired so i thought id make him work a little more
2913831 ive played him before and i knew he could come back
2913832 i dont think it had anything to do with it
2913833 i dont play people as good as she is during the year
2913834 a team has three long board and three short board surfers
2913835 you are rated for points on size of the wave and your own maneuver
2913836 i threw that first pitch to jimmy and i felt something down my triceps i tried to throw the next pitch and felt it again so i decided to make the call
2913837 as of right now i think its just a slight triceps strain but were going to wait and see what happens the next two days i was able to do all of my exercises after this all my rotator cuff exercises its not sore
2913838 i knew it wasnt right so i didnt want to push it
2913839 i felt it come down my triceps the elbow feels fine
2913840 ive played in many big games but the energy tonight was different
2913841 obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity
2913842 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy
2913843 im kind of glad its out of the way now this game was just over the top
2913844 he basically came up to us and said im here to support you our country supports you and so go out there and kick some butt
2913845 im out there trying to do it every time but there was more emphasis because weve been struggling like we have it was a big win for us
2913846 shes very consistent you pretty much know what youre going to get every night pitchers and catchers are making better adjustments you have to be one step above them and caitlins always had that knack shes a real addition for us
2913847 natasha and i really look at our role as we need to get on base because we have so many hitters behind us that are looking for that rbi
2913848 offensively i want to get on base any way i can and hopefully move around on the bases as much as we can
2913849 its only 82 degrees in there kind of heated but when you go from outside to there it feels like 40
2913850 sure sam let me greet the rest of these folks and ill meet you back at the study
2913851 i was wondering if you would come by and talk with mary and me sometime parson
2913852 that would be a delight sam you got a time in mind
2913853 well mary said if you could come by tuesday evening shed fix you a nice supper we know ms parson is out of town
2913854 mary and i have decided to get married parson we wanted to talk with you about performing the ceremony and whatever else you might want to talk with us about
2913855 im just surprised at this sam you and mary have been living together for sixteen years why do you want to get married now
2913856 the capital of south ossetia bears all the appearance of a place that has been pulverised by days of georgian bombing and by the ferocious russian counter attack that followed
2913857 you are coming with us to tskhinvali you are not going back i promise you
2913858 nonsense arguing that evidence of woolies coles and metcash ripping off either consumers or farmers is not borne out in the companies gross profit margins
2913859 they have different start dates and dont go back as far as available data says zumbo
2913860 the choice of start dates can impact considerably on the result and produce distortions in the analysis
2913861 this requires that you have a common start point and you go back as far as the data is available on both counts the accc has failed
2913862 these facts were not disputed during the inquiry and are backed up by data from the oedc he says
2913863 and there has been also an increase in wheat and grain prices which have fed back into feedlot prices says king
2913864 there are a range of factors which led to this relatively high increase in prices compared to the cpi says king but only one twentieth of this had showed up in gross profit margins of the major chains and metcash if that
2913865 why did the accc choose the base index as 2000 01 it did not use the year 2000 1 as the index for anything else so why pick this year for eggs
2913866 further abare uses 1997 8 as the base year with the index as 100 so why wouldnt the accc have used this year to start their analysis why pick 2000 1 as the base year for eggs
2913867 in beef we start in 1998 no idea why in biscuits march 2002 bread march 2002 pink lady apples 2004 chicken meat march 2002
2913868 this claim that we picked specific dates to somehow manipulate the figures is nonsense says king if there is a anomaly it is beef
2913869 the odds of randomly selecting different base years which just
2913870 the only conclusion that can be reached is that these dates have been deliberately selected
2913871 increased when in reality they have remained depressed for a long period of time
2913872 according for eggs it is not true to say there is an increasing gap between the farmgate and the retail price
2913873 the facts are that farmgate price for eggs have increased just 12 since 1990 yet the retail price has increased over 100
2913874 this is not an egg inquiry its an inquiry into grocery prices perhaps mr kelly could ask the government to conduct an inquiry into what has happened to egg prices over the past 25 years
2913875 manufacturing milk is used for cheese production powdered milk ice cream and so forth
2913876 market milk is for drinking these two categories were separated before deregulation of the dairy industry in 2000 and since then the price of manufacturing milk has been equivalent to the price of market milk
2913877 gross value of production is still separate for market milk and manufacturing milk
2913878 clearly something is wrong says kelly the accc ignored all this by setting the index as 2002
2913879 secondly the point in milk was march 2003 if we had wanted to do what he is saying manipulating our findings we would have started that graph in march 2003
2913880 this report is not intended to address long term issues in the milk industry that is not what this report is about
2913881 gross value of production for market milk in 1999 00
2913882 the farmers were getting 1011 million income for market milk yet in 2002 3 their income had fallen to 521 million

2914016 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2914017 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2914018 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2914019 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2914020 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2914021 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2914022 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2914023 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2914024 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2914025 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2914026 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2914027 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2914028 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2914029 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2914030 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2914031 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2914032 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2914033 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2914034 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2914035 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2914036 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2914037 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2914038 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2914039 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2914040 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2914041 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2914042 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2914043 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2914044 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2914045 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2914046 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2914047 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2914048 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2914049 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2914050 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2914051 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2914052 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2914053 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2914054 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2914055 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2914056 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2914057 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2914058 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2914059 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2914060 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2914061 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2914062 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2914063 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2914064 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2914065 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2914066 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2914067 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2914068 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2914069 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2914070 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2914071 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2914072 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2914073 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2914074 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2914075 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2914076 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2914077 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2914078 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2914079 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2914080 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2914081 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2914082 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2914083 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2914084 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2914085 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2914086 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2914087 who are open to doing something on the production side
2914088 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2914089 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2914090 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2914091 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2914092 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2914093 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2914094 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2914095 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2914096 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2914097 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2914098 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2914099 this is so cool to have this kind of a night
2914100 fortunately everybody got out without getting banged up along the sidelines im talking about the fans so i think that in itself was a successful night
2914101 as soon as one starts getting more reps than the other then well officially know
2914102 it feels good to get out there and go full speed
2914103 i saw that play the whole way it was either going to be an interception or a big hit
2914104 i made a big deal to these guys that this was the first chance they get to make a first impression about what kind of football players they are
2914105 this is real ball thats what you hope to see on a night like this
2914106 thats the best ive ever done in my whole life

2914119 in any case the time is too short for monika to compete in olympics
2914120 she has tested positive and there is no reason why she should compete in beijing we have no information that she is coming here
2914121 people have suffered injuries during the agitation and some people have lost their lives about seven people have lost lives in both jammu and kashmir in the violence both state and central government will give them compensation
2914122 the sad part is that since elections are coming near so political parties have found a way to further aggravate the entire situation
2914123 there is no economic blockade and if at all there are a few some cases then we are taking it seriously i am in conversation with punjab chief minister badal parkash singh and also constantly in touch with home minister we will seriously look into the matter if any problem arises fruit traders will not face any problem i have appealed to people that they should not be scared and should continue with their work and if we get any complaint we will look into the matter
2914124 we have said that it s a long term issue this cannot be addressed immediately it will be resolved in long term only but firstly peace should prevail here the situation is aggravated and the communal and regional divisions have been sharpened such situation should be controlled victims of violence should be given compensation fruit traders should be protected and closed road should be reopened at any cost
2914125 even after curfew relaxation shops in the market are mostly closed nobody is getting anything daily necessities like food medicines are also not available there is no wheat and rice at the departmental stores there is no water and electricity in spite of all these problems government says that they have relaxed the curfew this is absolutely wrong
2914126 until now the agitation and protests were confined to jammu
2914127 i could not control my movement in the second half and that made the difference
2914128 i have been thinking about winning a medal but i never thought it would turn out to be the first gold medal for china i am very happy and i did a good job
2914129 now i have achieved the very best everything that i could get especially since its my first gold at the olympics it feels amazing
2914130 i think we can say that spain is going through something of a golden age in sport at the moment
2914131 we won euro 2008 rafael nadal is the number one tennis player in the world and we have got nba basketball players like pau gasol and jose calderon
2914132 it is absolutely amazing we made history today i am proud of myself as well as sada and becca
2914133 i wanted a gold medal i wouldnt care if it is my first or last it is mine
2914134 there are lot of trees and everythings very green quite different from last time
2914135 wonderful no comparison with athens in 2004 you really have to say the chinese have gone to a lot of trouble to be good hosts

2914151 look at three things and you wont come to sin where you are going to the grave ethics of the fathers 3 1 ethics of the fathers does not say where you will be going in the future but where you are already going from the time we are born we begin a journey whose destination is our eventual death and entry into the afterlife thats why we must make the most out of every single day of our lives as the talmud states rabbi eliezer said repent one day before your death his students asked him does a person know when his day of death will occur he answered them then he should repent today perhaps he will die tomorrow thus all his days will be full of repentance this is what king solomon said in kohelet 9 8 your clothing should be white at all times there is an allegory which illustrates this a king invited his servants to a grand feast but did not inform them when the feast was to transpire the smart ones dressed in their finest clothes and prepared themselves by waiting outside the palaces entrance the foolish ones remained in their common clothes and continued to engage in their own pursuits thinking they had plenty of time suddenly the king asked for all to attend and only the smart ones were asked to sit eat drink and enjoy

2914253 i asked if it is correct to understand that the delisting will not take place today because not only has the verification process of north koreas nuclear activities not begun but the regime and details on how to implement have not been set and she said yes that would be correct

2914274 una medalla en los juegos es complicado mireia va a intentar entrar en la final de los 200 estilos pero es muy dif cil hablar de medalla es muy dif cil por no decir imposible hay que estar ah hay que luchar porque en unos juegos ol mpicos es muy complicado te cambia todo
2914275 tambi n dejo la nataci n por mi hija me gustar a dedicar m s tiempo a ella y ya tengo que jubilarme hacer mi vida quiero vivir como otros humanos porque realmente el deporte la nataci n no es la vida real es un tiempo que pasamos muy bien pero sacrificamos muchas cosas no es la vida real claro que es sano porque primero te hace mucha disciplina te crea car cter
2914276 un profesional se crea m s exigencias para l mismo que los dem s crean para l una persona que no es profesional entonces s que tiene que ser el entrenador el que tiene que estar ah esto esto esto pero un profesional es el que pone las metas
2914277 me gustar a poder nadar m s r pido pero en 50 por la ma ana est bien no es lo mismo hacer un europeo que una olimpiada al principio de la temporada estaba pensando que iba a ser muy complicado ir a los juegos estar toda la temporada bajando de 1 01 00 ya es un gran nivel
2914278 he cambiado un poco la t cnica no voy tan suelta noto la diferencia repetir 1 05 aqu tampoco era tan f cil
2914279 meterme en la final era complicado pero sacando mi marca he quedado bastante contenta
2914280 parece que coughlin no va muy fina parece que no est reserv ndose veremos a ver primero la vi en atenas a kirsty coventry con uno once ah s que ha sido una sorpresa el r cord del mundo tambi n lo bati aunque qued segunda el nivel es alt simo en todo
2914281 hay mucha gente que una vez que empieza a nadar tres veces y hay gente que queda fuera de las finales o de la final por reservarse entonces la gente est tan asustada que dice no no yo por la ma ana en la eliminatoria voy a hacer mi marca
2914282 kejayaan ini berjaya membuktikan walaupun umur sudah meningkat saya masih boleh berjaya dalam bidang akademik dan berharap ia menjadi contoh dan perangsang kepada golongan muda
2914283 no he nadado del todo c modo y aun as el tiempo ha sido mejor que el del domingo me veo con mucho nimo y ganas para la final
2914284 ya ha demostrado que es un nadador que ya ha estado a ese nivel miles de veces y creo yo que de la final es el nico nadador que se puede permitir el lujo de nadar en las semifinales un poco m s c modo
2914285 solo creo que es peirsol el que no ha ido al m ximo

2914293 they have a credibility problem and they need to address it
2914294 the way to address it is to one present what it is theyre proposing and number two respond to questions and take public comment on it
2914295 we worked with the town agencies for more than a year before the development plan was announced to the public when it was announced to the public i expected that the process of public disclosure and explanation would be directed by the board of selectmen and the first selectman who would tell us what meetings to have that was a mistake
2914296 tell the community at large what your plans are thats my expectation
2914297 its their job to tell people what theyre proposing to do its not mine
2914298 i dont want to go and have him turn us down
2914299 the latter allows people to move their arms immediately after surgery
2914300 it has been a dream of mine to start a foundation like this
2914301 it was a great opportunity to work in medical research a field i am interested in
2914302 the aim of the study is to figure out ways to decrease shoulder pain in youth baseball
2914303 the purpose is to reduce the incidences of acl tears by teaching simple exercises it can be a tool for athletes and coaches
2914304 the east of england has kept a steady pace of growth which is to me a sign the regional development agency has had no impact we should be seeing increased trends with all this spending
2914305 at a time when businesses are increasingly over regulated and over taxed it has become a symbol of wasteful bureaucratic excess
2914306 employment and business growth in the region has increased since 1999 over the same period eeda has created or safeguarded nearly 32 000 jobs
2914307 so we cant be sloppy we want to make sure everything is done properly
2914308 theres a lot of money involved in setting up a detour
2914309 and once people are used to it you dont want to change anything
2914310 a year ago you had a deteriorating bridge with potholes and a low safety rating
2914311 pretty soon itll be a new clean two way bridge
2914312 its very relaxing a lot of us old timers are here
2914313 it is so nice to ride over to the beach
2914314 people could hear us when we were coming in and sometimes they would clap for us
2914315 in ireland they didnt have much sun so my mother thought it was good for us
2914316 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2914317 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2914318 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2914319 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2914320 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2914321 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2914322 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2914323 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2914324 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2914325 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2914326 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2914327 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2914328 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2914329 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2914330 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2914331 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2914332 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2914333 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2914334 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2914335 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2914336 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2914337 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2914338 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2914339 fueron atacadas desde el aire los radares situados en la monta a majata
2914340 its called a receptor because it interacts with a hormone in this case a hormone called gm csf
2914341 and when that happens it can cause uncontrolled growth and thats what
2914342 at the moment many leukaemias are treated with chemotherapy that destroys the diseased blood cells and bone marrow as well as normal cells
2914343 we hope that this discovery will lead to targeted therapies more specific to the malfunctioning cells seen in diseases such as leukaemia
2914344 i think thats a real positive of this work it could target those diseases that are just untreatable at the moment or very difficult to treat

2914346 we did a little conga line as a team and everybody just loved it we gained some fan support just like that
2914347 they play this dutch music so we just started dancing with them during the rain delay it was a big scene
2914348 this is going to be interesting just because the culture is so different
2914349 the bus was probably three to four times the size of a regular transit bus
2914350 we scrubbed and mopped and swept for six hours in the press room
2914351 it feels like a carnival or a festival going at all times bands playing mariachis going its more than just baseball
2914352 the rest of it was like old ruins blown out old stuff with no windows or anything they raised some cain and got us moved to a better hotel in downtown havana
2914353 the elevator took 30 minutes to go up two floors it makes you appreciate america that much more the fans were great it was packed every game they appreciate baseball it was really nice to see that kind of stuff if you made a nice defensive play theyd stand and give you an ovation
2914354 we experienced some extremely bad rain and thunderstorms like right in the middle of our games which is pretty unusual
2914355 the funny thing was we played right through it they didnt call the game so we just had to play through it its extremely tough to throw with a wet ball to have to do that for a couple of innings was very challenging it was a good experience you get to experience how other countries rules are and how they play the game i wasnt going to complain
2914356 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
2914357 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
2914358 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
2914359 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
2914360 but as soon as the swimming was over and michael phelps didnt break my record every time i went to beach volley they put my face on the volleyballs
2914361 if any algae is spotted in the morning we will alert command to dispatch boats
2914362 there is some algae on the water and they are cleaning algae right now
2914363 we sailed into it just for fun it stopped the boat
2914364 it was four or five inches 10 13 centimeters thick
2914365 after 2004 my only target was to defend my title in beijing
2914366 getting a silver medal is already a very good consolation for me because i really worked hard for it
2914367 ive been through a lot of hardship and shed a lot of tears in the last four years there have been successes and failures
2914368 after 2004 my only aim has not changed i had so very much wanted to be a champion at the beijing olympics
2914369 in the last two rounds i made several mistakes because i had used up all my physical and mental energy
2914370 i was under tremendous pressure and at times i felt really agitated
2914371 its the thrill of my life thats about it its hard to describe i just went for it i knew i was lying in fourth thankfully it went my way and i just went for it
2914372 i was under tremendous pressure and at times i felt really agitated
2914373 ive been through a lot of hardship and shed a lot of tears in the last four years there have been successes and failures
2914374 after 2004 my only aim has not changed i had so very much wanted to be a champion at the beijing olympics
2914375 in the last two rounds i made several mistakes because i had used up all my physical and mental energy
2914376 i wasnt thinking of making history i was two points behind the leaders i was just trying to shoot good shots i wanted to shoot well and shoot aggressively and thats what i did
2914377 it shows that shooting is a sport from the first to the final shot every one counts
2914378 i havent prayed so much in my life with the second last shot they tied together and then he bindra shot a 10 8 it couldnt have got better

2914390 the road race was a huge goal for me as a team event
2914391 now ive seen the course and the setup for wednesday and i definitely would say i saw a lot of the key time trialists backing off when it got bad out here
2914392 they slaughtered themselves everyone on our team is a fabulous time trialist before they were a fabulous road racer so thats important
2914393 if any algae is spotted in the morning we will alert command to dispatch boats

2914403 i would be absolutely delighted if berbatov was still at the club after the end of the transfer window
2914404 he is a magnificent player and we want to enjoy another season of him at this club i cant answer on behalf of the player though
2914405 carlos came to us a year ago straight after the copa america
2914406 his fitness now is light years ahead of where it was then and we are expecting big things from him
2914407 the great thing about tevez is that he has a heart to play the game he is not intimidated at all he fights for every ball and is a real handful
2914408 the decision to make him man of the match was fully justified
2914409 it was a superb performance he was a constant thorn to portsmouth and it is just a pity he did not get a goal
2914410 i cant answer the question because i dont have the right answer
2914411 but it is possible i will sign someone this week we are trying and we are looking at one or two options
2914412 it has been a pressing concern since the end of last season we like to operate with four strikers and we have not been able to do that
2914413 wes only missed two games last season and was absolutely outstanding
2914414 i was right beside jan and i thought it was a penalty but some people have said it wasnt
2914415 jan was trying to set himself up and the guy was pulling at him
2914416 i would need to see it again but at the end of the day we got the penalty and scored it and thats the main thing
2914417 it wasnt my best penalty but its only a bad penalty if you miss it and it was well over the line
2914418 i tried to drill it a bit higher but i didnt quite catch it right but these things happen when you take penalties and as long as it goes in thats the main thing
2914419 i dont think we were at our best but you have to give st mirren credit they did really well they looked fit and fresh and passed the ball well
2914420 we played better against kilmarnock on the first day last year and only drew
2914421 we had a good pre season and worked hard but we know its a long season and we will get sharper
2914422 but the thing is we got the three points and now we can work on getting better
2914423 the referee was winking at me he would need to explain why i dont know whether he was trying to irritate me or not i dont know but hell deny it
2914424 its so so difficult to say what you really feel weve seen it go on a number of times now and youve just got to bite your tongue

2914571 theres a shift taking place in this country away from using shelters as a response to homelessness
2914572 to see that kind of decrease in chronically homeless during a downturn year i would say were making a difference
2914573 what were are struggling with is funding for the services
2914574 theres very little i can say right now were looking at it as a suspicious death
2914575 a lot of those things that we think of as being odors are often times flammable
2914576 so if you burn them you can break them down from whatever their formula was into carbon dioxide so you hopefully dont smell it

2914584 i just want to leave singing and praising the lord he said to me on the phone
2914585 i guess he knew his life was about to end
2914586 theres more competition now and i think thats probably a big reason why
2914587 its the refined against the rustic the restaurant is designed to make people feel comfortable maybe without exactly knowing why
2914588 we wanted the feel to be like youre going to someones loft for a dinner party
2914589 all the restaurants are side by side and competing with each other
2914590 if you put a restaurant in the pocket you dont have a lot of competition and everyone isnt right there with you
2914591 organic with a lot of wood and some stone and some steel elements
2914592 a lot of it is just how you take things that you like and make them a little more unique

2914594 and we realize that the chances of that happening are pretty high
2914595 i decided i had to look for the other baby
2914596 he is so happy i have never seen him this way and for that reason i love her
2914597 i hope for their sake they are related but it doesnt matter because they share this wonderful connection
2914598 it is what it is i would think it was a really strange coincidence if they werent related
2914599 what would i say to a woman who left me to die
2914600 ive been at this 28 years and ive never heard of two women having children and abandoning them on the same day in such a small area

2914605 a decision about whether we would build our own wave energy farm
2914606 wave energy sounds like a good idea as long as it doesnt harm the environment
2914607 using the power of the waves seems like a better way of generating power than building oil platforms off the coast
2914608 when you first hear about it you think thats a great idea
2914609 they seem to have gone beyond the logical stopping point

2914613 from the standpoint of a confidence thing the guys never give up and being able to play together so long theyve been in so many battles they never get down they never think theyre out of the game so thats a plus
2914614 its basically the same team we had two years ago in juniors competition the experience factor definitely helps us a lot
2914615 its a whole different speed of game from juniors to seniors
2914616 we kind of have the upper hand we know what to expect
2914617 i didnt know if we could win i thought our time would be maybe next year i thought we maybe were a year away from playing in the championship game but well take it
2914618 me being a ballplayer and playing all the years i did in pro ball and never making it to the big leagues to even step on those fields its like sacred grounds

2914625 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2914626 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2914627 we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides we must talk about negotiations and a political solution there is no military solution

2914632 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2914633 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2914634 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2914635 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2914636 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2914637 the suspect contacted the police after he saw the article about the incident in a newspaper on friday he said he lives in naboomspruit and would hand himself over to the police next week
2914638 according to the garage workers the afrikaans speaking man came into the shop bought something and spoke to them but they didnt understand what he was saying because they dont know the language
2914639 he reportedly went outside climbed into his bakkie stopped in front of the shop and said to the dog sa vat hulle go grab them
2914640 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2914641 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2914642 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2914643 i think certainly as realtime worlds weve been pretty cautious of seeing some of our peers being hyped championed way too early and it all being a let down
2914644 were people that need to make sure theres a good awareness of what we do and at the end of the day we want our products our games to be talking for themselves
2914645 so with something like crackdown we could have pushed microsoft into hyping it even earlier but as it was we felt it was done too early as it stood wed have rather waited until much later until more people had seen the game and were impressed by it rather than seeing the early versions
2914646 its maybe not necessarily the most conventional way of going about publicising yourself but i think if we can build up a reputation for consistently delivering great games then hopefully we wont need to come out with the hyperbole that often comes out with games and often never comes through

2914652 i decided if there was a need at camp taji then other fobs might be in need also
2914653 realizing that there are hobby and woodshops on most overseas bases we envision being able to supply their noncommissioned officers in charge with hard to get requested items as well
2914654 im sure the need for certain items is still great no matter where troops are stationed

2914662 there are just too many things happening lately to absorb any further costs national association of retail grocers australia spokesman ken henrick told the committee
2914663 rising petrol prices a proposed emissions trading scheme and the added costs of a unit pricing scheme would raise store running costs very substantially he said
2914664 it would make it difficult for them to be more competitive and from the customers perspective introducing unit pricing may simply have the effect of raising prices
2914665 lets say the 1 500sq m store youre still going to have disproportionate costs compared with the 4 500sq m store
2914666 but it will also bear costs that the 1 000sq m store will not be required to cover
2914667 so the stores that are inside that scheme but are close to the bottom level will have some difficulty i would imagine
2914668 the only costs really for a well run store are the initial set up costs the initial changes to signage and to computerised equipment and computer programs mr jarratt said
2914669 that surprises me a little bit considering the amount of work that the accc have done on the grocery report and given the bill has been around for some time and given particularly your recommendation for a mandatory unit pricing system senator fielding said
2914670 cpi inflation is expected to be higher in the short term at around 5 per cent in the december quarter reflecting the effects of higher petrol prices and the recent correction to estimates of financial services inflation before declining thereafter
2914671 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2914672 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2914673 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being
2914674 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are likely to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
2914675 the combination of falls in housing and equity prices means that household net wealth has declined in the first half of this year
2914676 last night i spent a couple of hours at beer and blog a weekly get together for those of us in portland oregon the premise bloggers helping bloggers over beer we usually meet at the green dragon who love us sometimes we work together and sometimes there is a specific and tasty topic of discussion suffice to say its a popular event among local bloggers and when you have a popular local blogger author startup entrepreneur leading the discussion you can be sure lots of people will show up
2914677 beer and blog is undoubtedly the best way to meet members of this growing portland tech community in an informal relaxed environments if by informal and relaxed you mean meeting local tweeters and bloggers that you followed and subscribed to 24 7 but could only see in 48 48 pixel avatars

2914679 jeremiah owyangs recent post about the many challenges of the social media industry got me thinking about how social media requires a different approach from the way that many companies approach traditional marketing or customer engagement jeremiahs post seems to be more targeted at companies whose main products and services are based on social media but im going to take some of the ideas that he discusses and outline how they can be applied to companies using social media as part of their strategy for engaging with customers or communities or users
2914680 this is an athletic event but the most important aspect is thousands of people connecting through a common bond organ donation
2914681 what we wanted was to free ourselves from colonialism and all those who could help us were welcome and we saw them as true friends
2914682 today also we are not going to be carried away by similar accusations because what we want is to free ourselves from poverty and once again we are ready to accept all the aid that anyone wishes to give us
2914683 the world would be a much better place than it is today though we must recognise that that the world has already changed much for the better in recent years

2914708 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2914709 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2914710 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2914711 i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events
2914712 ive never paid a dime of money to any of the people that are involved
2914713 ive never asked anybody to pay a dime of money never been told that any moneys been paid nothing has been done at my request so if the allegation is that somehow i participated in the payment of money that is a lie an absolute lie which is typical of these types of publications
2914714 published in a supermarket tabloid that is absolutely not true
2914715 i cannot make any sense out of that when i went to this meeting youve already asked me about uh i was not wearing a t shirt i was wearing a long sleeved shirt with the sleeves rolled up i dont know who that picture i dont know if that picture is me it could well be it looks like me i dont know who that baby is i have no idea what that picture is
2914716 i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea

2914752 isso mostra que as pessoas pobres n o est o se acomodando
2914753 em todos esses casos as fam lias tomaram a iniciativa
2914754 fui salva pelo bolsa fam lia me ajudou pra caramba
2914755 mas agora n o estou precisando liguei para a assistente social e disse n o acho justo
2914756 rasguei meu cart o porque minha filha mais nova de 14 anos parou de estudar ent o eu disse que n o era justo continuar recebendo aqueles r 75 por m s me ajudava claro que ajudava eu pagava o g s comprava um cal ado material escolar mas n o posso pegar mais esse dinheiro
2914757 sei que o pobre brasileiro muito humilde e j soube de casos exemplares de pessoas que devolveram o cart o mas esse n mero de 60 mil devolu es aponta um grau espetacular de civilidade surpreendente

2914771 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2914772 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
2914773 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2914774 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
2914775 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2914776 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
2914777 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
2914778 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
2914779 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try

2914823 uma fal cia dizer que os produtos chineses s o c pias baratas dos fabricados em outros pa ses

2914825 al m do esfor o comercial da china para atuar nos mercados globais a valoriza o do real ante o d lar contribuiu decisivamente para esse resultado
2914826 o ambiente de neg cios no brasil ainda muito menos favor vel produ o do que na china
2914827 isso somado ao grande spread diferen a entre o custo de capta o e o dos empr stimos do setor banc rio nacional representa desest mulo aos investimentos

2914851 acho que meu desempenho tem a ver mais com a maturidade n o fiquei nervosa porque j fiz muitos vestibulares mais de oito

2914863 well i went down to margate at the weekend and decided to take a ride on the roller coaster as we came up to the top of the highest loop i noticed a little sign by the side of the track i tried to read it but it was very small and i couldnt make it out i was so curious that i decided to go round again but we went by so quickly that i couldnt see what the sign said by now i was determined to read that sign so i went round a third time as we reached the top i stood up in the car to get a better view
2914864 and did you manage to see what the sign said this time
2914865 the floodwaters swept thousands of containers of varying sizes along its path and left them along roadways in farm fields and in environmentally sensitive areas
2914866 it took a lot of people to get everyone out
2914867 we all like trees because theyre shady but theyre not good for the prairie
2914868 i hope the girls get an understanding of how restoration does help the larger community as a whole not just the people but also helping the wildlife that lives here like the butterflies the pocket gophers and the coyotes
2914869 it was really cool maybe theres a way to get the wolf population back some of them are really low its really scary
2914870 camp this summer has really been about learning how to take care of ourselves learning how to take care of our environment and take care of our community
2914871 i read that too michele that is what made me think of it
2914872 lol libby but its interesting b c on his website clay specifically wrote that his sons name is void of hyphens and he made a big deal of saying that the boys name stands on its own
2914873 i would get a firestorm of criticism if i talked about enforcing the immigration law against illegals
2914874 we have shied away from unnecessary involvement dealing with immigration issues
2914875 initiating police action where the objective is to discover the alien status of a person
2914876 but if i see a deportee from the mara salvatrucha salvadoran prison gang crossing the street i know i cant touch him
2914877 any broadening of the policy gets us into the immigration business
2914878 its a federal law enforcement issue not a local law enforcement issue
2914879 it is not the time it is not the day to look at special order 40
2914880 if you arrested someone you wanted to detain youd go to your boss and start a bidding war
2914881 youd say my guy ran three blocks threw a couple of punches and had six pieces of id
2914882 it was like the fish and wildlife service youd tag their ear and let them go
2914883 we have time and time again been unable to reach ins on the phone
2914884 when we reach them on the phone they require that we write a letter when we write a letter they require that it be by a superior
2914885 due process allows you to stay for years without an adjudication
2914886 a regular immigration attorney can keep you in the country for three years a high priced one for ten
2914887 they all come back they cant make it in mexico
2914888 we dont worry because were not doing anything wrong i know its illegal i need the papers but here nobody asks you for papers
2914889 theres an implication that somehow you did something wrong and you need to be forgiven
2914890 i believe they have a right to work to drive their kids to school
2914891 get in your face about their rights because our failure to enforce the law emboldens them
2914892 are fed up with efforts to make them feel that they do not have that fundamental right of any people to decide who will join them and help form the future country in which they and their posterity will live
2914893 institutionalizing illegal immigration creates a mindset in people that anything goes in the u s
2914894 it creates a new subculture with a sequela of social ills

2914912 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out he had sarcoidosis lung disease but it was in remission
2914913 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from

2914928 im not friends with amy winehouse i dont live in camden ive never smoked crack ive had experiences with drugs some good some bad and its not something i want to pursue i can say now ive never overdosed
2914929 the family had last seen him about noon family members had gone to the grocery store and left him at home
2914930 when the family came home around one his wifes cousin found him lying on the floor in the basement near a treadmill the treadmill was running so it is believed that he had been working out
2914931 there doesnt seem to be any foul play we dont see anything suspicious about his death there will be a further statement from the hospital about the cause of death
2914932 to be honest it was when i was afraid that people would recognise me that i was recognised much more when i first arrived in london i was much more afraid of that so i stayed in
2914933 but after a while i began to feel claustrophobic and thought we have to get out
2914934 i have an incredible amount of vintage that ive collected over the years
2914935 my style is very americana i gravitate to pieces that are american by nature either western or depression era
2914936 i do almost everything in jeans except sleep denim has become so high priced as of late my friends back home dont want to spend 250 gbp125 for a pair of jeans i want them to be able to walk into a medium priced store and be able to afford a cool pair of jeans for less than 100 bucks dollars
2914937 you dont think there are some deluded americans hey how about all of us
2914938 everyone here is obsessed with tabloid celebrities and their lives and wanting to be like that just like kim
2914939 in america you have the people who watch the lohans reality show and want to be like dina and ali lohan and live in a house with a throne in it everywhere theyre just everywhere
2914940 last week me sic voice was a bag os te i had to have a word with myself i want this to be a success i want this to be great i thought im going to have to tone it down a bit
2914941 load of big fat lines load of cigarettes staying up late talking the same s t you talked the night before and the night before that thats not good for it his voice
2914942 when its good no one can touch me and when its bad its a bit better than pete doherty

2914944 we are communications professors and we believe that people in this culture do not talk about death or cancer or grief as much as they should
2914945 the intent was to narrate the experience from diagnosis to death and through grief to give people a real sense of what its like
2914946 when leah got cancer one of the frustrating things to me was i could not find a book written from a spouses perspective
2914947 i was going to be the caregiver so i really wanted that information so i thought i would write a book from a husbands perspective i asked leah if she would like to contribute she thought that would be a way to teach people we started taping in september 2004 three months before her death
2914948 we planned to teach 10 more years build our dream house and get old together
2914949 i felt a searing pain in my abdomen i doubled over i thought it was a bladder or urinary infection
2914950 the doctors said were never going to be able to stop this cancer
2914951 at the end of a course of chemotherapy they said the cancer would come back within six months to two years we were thinking we would have some time together but it returned in less than three months
2914952 if i put on my optimistic view which i have to do in this job maybe we will end up with 14 teams
2914953 of course that would be wonderful if we could do that and it would be wonderful if the teams are also strong
2914954 the crowds are growing the television audience is growing membership is growing the media coverage as well and the game is reasonably financially sound
2914955 now what we have to do is make sure the clubs also become sound
2914956 and we have some important and ambitious long term goals for the a league
2914957 things are looking very good for a fairly moderate season
2914958 were definitely not seeing a repeat of what we saw last year anyway which is very good news
2914959 its been very quiet in victoria and elsewhere though there is still virus circulating
2914960 its not a government promise or a government plan its an unsolicited proposal from the private sector
2914961 you dont just sign up to something because somebody outside of government comes along and goes well heres a good idea
2914962 if they can make this work and still protect the service for the people of the western suburbs at a reasonable price then we certainly can have further discussions
2914963 its called a receptor because it interacts with a hormone in this case a hormone called gm csf
2914964 and when that happens it can cause uncontrolled growth and thats what cancer is about
2914965 at the moment many leukaemias are treated with chemotherapy that destroys the diseased blood cells and bone marrow as well as normal cells
2914966 we hope that this discovery will lead to targeted therapies more specific to the malfunctioning cells seen in diseases such as leukaemia
2914967 i think thats a real positive of this work it could target those diseases that are just untreatable at the moment or very difficult to treat
2914968 almost anything you could possible want to read will be there

2914971 six good innings how one small town became a little league giant
2914972 business and consumer confidence is at its lowest level now since the recession in 1991
2914973 this is just one of hundreds of thousands of businesses in australia that represent collectively the energy and the enterprise that is the foundation of our economic prosperity in australia
2914974 one of the reasons we stay very closely in touch with small business is not just because so many people from our side of politics come from a small business background but because small business is the largest employer in australia
2914975 crucial to the coalition reconnecting with small business making sure that our policies reflect their needs
2914976 by and large if youre a politician and youre not out there then you need to some serious brushing up
2914977 to speak directly to their elected representatives about how things are in the business community
2914978 none of the commissioners had or had even heard of email there were no mobile phones no digital cameras no high tech surveillance cameras in public places
2914979 no other comparable jurisdiction in the world exempts small business from the general privacy law
2914980 the australian regime is more restrictive than in most comparable countries
2914981 the government needs to pick up the alrcs suggestion that more data can be permitted when government and industry implement a responsible lending framework
2914982 equally however there is need for government effectiveness and for data to be communicated between agencies and government departments
2914983 current common and statute laws strike careful balances between the protection of legitimate interests in privacy and the respect for freedom of speech which has been a hallmark of our legal system
2914984 nonsense arguing that evidence of woolies coles and metcash ripping off either consumers or farmers is not borne out in the companies gross profit margins
2914985 they have different start dates and dont go back as far as available data says zumbo
2914986 the choice of start dates can impact considerably on the result and produce distortions in the analysis
2914987 this requires that you have a common start point and you go back as far as the data is available on both counts the accc has failed
2914988 these facts were not disputed during the inquiry and are backed up by data from the oedc he says
2914989 and there has been also an increase in wheat and grain prices which have fed back into feedlot prices says king
2914990 there are a range of factors which led to this relatively high increase in prices compared to the cpi says king but only one twentieth of this had showed up in gross profit margins of the major chains and metcash if that
2914991 why did the accc choose the base index as 2000 01 it did not use the year 2000 1 as the index for anything else so why pick this year for eggs
2914992 further abare uses 1997 8 as the base year with the index as 100 so why wouldnt the accc have used this year to start their analysis why pick 2000 1 as the base year for eggs
2914993 in beef we start in 1998 no idea why in biscuits march 2002 bread march 2002 pink lady apples 2004 chicken meat march 2002
2914994 this claim that we picked specific dates to somehow manipulate the figures is nonsense says king if there is a anomaly it is beef
2914995 the odds of randomly selecting different base years which just
2914996 the only conclusion that can be reached is that these dates have been deliberately selected
2914997 increased when in reality they have remained depressed for a long period of time
2914998 according for eggs it is not true to say there is an increasing gap between the farmgate and the retail price
2914999 the facts are that farmgate price for eggs have increased just 12 since 1990 yet the retail price has increased over 100
2915000 this is not an egg inquiry its an inquiry into grocery prices perhaps mr kelly could ask the government to conduct an inquiry into what has happened to egg prices over the past 25 years
2915001 manufacturing milk is used for cheese production powdered milk ice cream and so forth
2915002 market milk is for drinking these two categories were separated before deregulation of the dairy industry in 2000 and since then the price of manufacturing milk has been equivalent to the price of market milk
2915003 gross value of production is still separate for market milk and manufacturing milk
2915004 clearly something is wrong says kelly the accc ignored all this by setting the index as 2002
2915005 secondly the point in milk was march 2003 if we had wanted to do what he is saying manipulating our findings we would have started that graph in march 2003
2915006 this report is not intended to address long term issues in the milk industry that is not what this report is about
2915007 gross value of production for market milk in 1999 00
2915008 the farmers were getting 1011 million income for market milk yet in 2002 3 their income had fallen to 521 million
2915009 so the diary farmers lost 500 million income but on average the retail price of milk continued to increase and increase substantially faster than the cpi hot in the city

2915016 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to
2915017 i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there
2915018 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up
2915019 its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone

2915028 being held in the el paso county jail near colorado springs colorado awaiting a military court martial for resisting the unjust and illegal war against and occupation of iraq robin will be court martialed for desertion with intent to remain away permanently article 85 of the uniform code of military justice in early september the maximum allowable penalty for a guilty verdict on this charge is three years confinement forfeiture of pay and a dishonorably discharge from the army in order to expedite robins trial it appears that his unit command the fourth brigade combat team fourth infantry division is option to not charge robin with speech related violations of military discipline opting to try and convict robin as fast as possible
2915029 robin long did what he did because of his conscience and because he believed that the war was wrong that he was simply running away or hiding out i think most americans now realize that the war in iraq is a complete mistake
2915030 so they had a hearing late at night robin was put into jail and since that point he has been held here in colarado springs in the criminal justice center in el paso county basically just a regular old county jail with all kinds of people dangerous criminals many of them and its a difficult place to be but robins in good spirits and were now dealing with the consequences of his action in the military courts here
2915031 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd please see the page for what you can do
2915032 if i tell the iraqi police or the sons of iraq they will tell the wrong people and i will be killed i dont trust them if i tell the americans theyll tell no one how they found about the grenades
2915033 when the sois sons of iraq stood up we were basically hiring terrorists
2915034 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire costs of that program
2915035 the u s military was supposed to be out of the employment business by now when it introduced the sons of iraq initiative last year senior commanders expected the local security personnel to be hired gradually into the ranks of the iraqi army and police but iraqs shiite dominated central government has balked at the idea of bringing so many young sunni men including many onetime militants into the countrys fledging security forces less than 20 of the roughly 103 000 sons of iraq had been given government jobs as of early june that has left u s forces responsible for employing and paying the iraqis
2915036 the national front and other onetime insurgent groups will join a bitter struggle for power between established sunni politicians of the iraqi islamic party and upstart leaders of the sahwa or awakening council a u s backed tribal alliance whose popularity has grown following its success in combating the group al qaeda in iraq entering the elections is to change the current reality in our area the domination of the sunni spectrum by the iraqi islamic party said effan al issawi the top awakening commander in falluja they are unworthy of leading the sunnis
2915037 i believe i have something okay we continue to urge the council of representatives to seek a compromise that can be adopted promptly we regret that the iraqi parliament adjourned yesterday without finishing its work on a local elections law the parliamentarians have made great strides towards finishing the closing agreement on most of the more difficult issues we recognize that the election law brought to the floor important questions regarding the status of kirkuk the status of kirkuk is indeed a sensitive issue that needs to be addressed in a serious fashion but it is an issue that cannot be solved through the legislative mechanism of the eleciton law the election law should not be held hostage to that problem
2915038 my understanding is that theyre continuing i dont have anything particular to say about the process right now we havent discussed those publicly before im not going to here as we said well provide you with details when we get through with this
2915039 i would not be prepared to provide a timeline for that
2915040 shiite militia leader muqtada al sadr stepped back into iraqs political fray friday with an offer that if genuine washington would be hard pressed to refuse set a timetable for withdrawal of u s troops from iraq and the mahdi army will begin to disband the main reason for the armed resistance is the american miltiary presence said sadr emissary salah al ubaidi who spoke to reporters in najaf friday if the american military begins to withdrawal there will be no need for these armed groups
2915041 was one of the main reasons that violence in iraq has dropped to the lowest levels in four years for both civilians and trooops
2915042 i was pleasantly surprised when i learned that libertarian party presidential candidate bob barr would be testifying he didnt disappoint he made a great opening statement about preserving constitutional liberty through checks and balances and the separation of powers but the best part of his testimony was in the second round before questioning what we are facing now is a constitutional clock and it is countind own what remains of the constitution of this great land i might ask then to introduce for the record the disappearing bill of rights this is the bill of rights that we as members of the judiciary committee know he holds up a copy of the bill of rights as adopted in 1791 he flips it over to reveal a copy of the bill of rights that is largely redacted this is what it is fast becoming you know its a sad day when a former congressman has to submit the bill of rights for the record in a congressional hearing
2915043 seemed to be really trying to make case for their won partys reelection they failed as petulant and petty as the republicans were throughout the hearing representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican hit the nail on the head it seems that we are hosting an anger management class this hearing will not cause us to impeach the president it will only serve to impeach congresss credibility the democrats have become a sorry excuse for an opposition party i dont think any of the many potentially deserving members of the bush administration will ever be impeached for the same reason that we didnt have impeachment hearings today or even months ago the democrats are just as corrupt and complicit spineless democrats are neocon appeasers and the blood is on their hands too
2915044 well wait a second who should be apologizing whos voted for this war who voted for the patriot act who supports all these appropriations who supports the fisa bill
2915045 you like to invoke the name ralph nader but you never invoke the name ross perot who won 19 of the vote and elected bill clinton president in 1992 with 43 or less of the vote clinton got less percentage of the vote than our current president did in 2000 but you never hear about
2915046 come on we can have a better country we can change this around

2915070 the youth of today is ever the people of tomorrow for this reason we have set before ourselves the task of innoculating our youth with the spirit of this community of the people at a very early age at an age when human beings are still unperverted and therefore unspoiled this reich stands and it is building itself up for the future upon its youth and this new reich will give its youth to no one but will itself take youth and give to youth its own education and its own upbringing

2915089 it is obvious that as world champions our biggest strengths are in the lineout and in the scrum
2915090 and it is precisely here where the opposition will try and neutralise us the all blacks use tactics which are illegal and as far as i know if it is illegal then it is not allowed
2915091 we have picked up three things that they do which are illegal in the lineouts it starts with their flanker coming through the lineout illegally to stop any ball thrown down to the scrumhalf
2915092 they also do their best to play the lineout jumpers in the air and jump across the line and then thirdly they manage to close the gap to a half a metre between the two sets of players
2915093 it is obvious that as world champions our biggest strengths are in the lineout and in the scrum

2915141 the gulag archipelago is one of the most famous books ever written
2915142 i cinesi mangiano tutto ci che vola tranne gli aeroplani tutto ci che ha quattro gambe tranne i tavoli e tutto ci che nuota tranne i sottomarini
2915143 the hebrew writer of the bible was not so well acquainted with egypt as has often been imagined
2915144 d they sold joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought joseph to egypt
2915145 and josephs master took him and put him in the prison a place where the kings prisoners were confined
2915146 then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his garment and came in to pharaoh
2915147 and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold collar about his neck
2915148 and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son who is born you shall throw into the river and every daughter you shall let live
2915149 and joseph ordered his servants the physicians to embalm his father
2915150 and these are the names of the sons of israel who came to egypt
2915151 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
2915152 go yourselves and take for yourselves straw where you can find it but do not diminish from your work anything
2915153 the lord god of the hebrews has met with us moses and aaron and now let us go we beseech you three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god
2915154 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
2915155 and the egyptians made the people of israel serve with rigor and they made their lives bitter with hard slavery in mortar and in brick and in all kinds of service in the field all their service which they made them serve was with rigor
2915156 we have made a recommendation that there should be a mandatory data breach notification provision
2915157 but a notification scheme gives individuals the information and opportunity to protect themselves against fraud and identity theft it also will provide a strong incentive for agencies and organisations to ensure that they secure their databases
2915158 we dont want a situation where any unauthorised access of information will result in a requirement to notify
2915159 the requirement to notify can result in reputational damage to a corporation in our view where the breach can cause a serious harm to an individual is when there should be disclosure
2915160 serious harm might be information such as a tax file number which can result in identity theft
2915161 we have moved the bar up so that were not looking at trivial breaches
2915162 these days information privacy touches almost every aspect of our daily lives including our medical records and health status our finances and creditworthiness the personal details collected and stored on a multiplicity of public and corporate databases and even the ability to control the display and distribution of our own images
2915163 we have given the government our report and its a matter for the government to work through the recommendations
2915164 its a big complex report my personal preference is that they do it right

2915166 finally we start to see his smile not everybody knows that he hadnt played an official game for four months but a talented player like him will retrieve his form very fast

2915173 so once all qualifications are met and a thorough verification done then the u s can at any time delist north korea

2915175 we see our investment in nelson mandela bay as a contribution to the uplifting of the area as has been so well demonstrated by the mandela bay development agency at the recent opening of govan mbeki avenue

2915177 we have a right to choose our remedy under the law and the texas election code provides an option for either injunctive relief including a restraining order or a writ of mandamus as the party continues to claim that electing state party leadership is not convention business we chose to seek the course that would allow for testimony and discussion before the court of what constitues the business of the convention filing for a writ of mandamus does not allow that opportunity
2915178 the underlying cause is a request for a writ of mandamus and this court lacks jurisdiction to hear such a request
2915179 the case was filed by former harris county republican party chairman gary polland
2915180 lloyd rule d pollands case was void ab initio or illegal from the beginning
2915181 neither polland nor medina has ever expressed interest in changing party rules or this statute
2915182 if they want to exclude the grass roots and control the process its not right
2915183 goldwater conservatives reagan republicans robertson crowd ron paul republicans and well real conservatives
2915184 and 10 or 15 percent disaffected republican voters means democrat barack obama wins texas
2915185 today grassroots leaders of our state were saved from the litigious cajoling of a disgruntled few who resorted to judicial activism rather than use the appropriate venue of the texas legislature to change an existing statute they didnt like or didnt understand and they were thwarted by a judge who knew it was wrong
2915186 during previous olympiad leonid tyagachev issued a call to pray for success of the russian national team what is noteworthy is that prior to this in the beginning of the games russians did not win any awards this is what actually prompted leonid tyagachev to ask for prayers to surprise of many russian athletes began to win medals in several days after the call
2915187 nationals of china cannot get spiritual support from priests of other countries yet at present there are no orthodox bishops and priests in the country the russian orthodox church currently possesses only one church and a community in hong kong and there is also one priest who visits beijing and conducts services on the territory of russian embassy for russian nationals and nationals of other countries that is for all orthodox believers residing in china
2915188 already caused many innocent victims and forced a great number of civilians to leave their homes
2915189 it is my dearest hope that military action will stop immediately and that they will abstain in the name of their common christian inheritance from further clashes and violence
2915190 i invite the international community and the countries with most influence in the current situation to make every effort to support and promote initiatives aimed at finding a peaceful and lasting solution

2915199 we as republicans hold ourselves to be the party that respects the rule of law
2915200 weve come to recognize that we have some serious problems within our own party
2915201 failure to elect the permanent chair before conducting convention business results in a failure to properly organize the convention
2915202 would authorize any local agency that maintains a community sewer system to take action to control residential salinity inputs including those from water softeners
2915203 one percent of water users are creating 10 percent of the salinity that 100 percent of us have to pay to clean up
2915204 the current law gives water softeners a carve out it basically says you have to have studies that address every other salinity issue before you get to water softeners this evens the playing field and allows this to be dealt with at the local level nobody has proposed mandatory removal of water softeners it requires compensation
2915205 please tell us by the demonstrable failure in existing law
2915206 every time you flush your toilet every time you brush your teeth every time you take a shower thats a residential input
2915207 the situation is the pain of our hearts in our parish in our community we have russians english and georgians and we believe in one spiritual community
2915208 hoy solo somos un desfile de intereses egos vanidades y dinero
2915209 the new fortwo maintains its tonka toy proportions and look at me im wearing designer glasses without a prescription unconventionality theres now a painted parenthesis around the drivers compartment a clever if unsuccessful attempt to reassure drivers that smarts got their back as theres nothing much behind them from certain angles the slash marked four two looks like a pokemon with weird sideburns anyway theres no denying that observers especially women fight the urge to muss the fortwos metaphorical hair and pinch its figurative cheeks
2915210 it is too dominated by the military and we have too little civilian capacity
2915211 the military should not take on what the us agency for international development does or the state department
2915212 people say i am a crazy for making this issue the center of my life

2915216 im very happy with the ncaa because they are taking their time and they are weighing the decision
2915217 he went home for all the right reasons and im very confident that everything will be worked out
2915218 he couldnt come to any of my games cause he couldnt fly
2915219 i had my four west virginia years at the time i didnt think i was going to come back
2915220 if the owners always there everybody works hard once the owner leaves everybody slacks off thats the way it always is
2915221 he came back in july and he was pumping 30 reps at 225 pounds
2915222 its very surprising it appears that the spanish anti doping controls didnt detect anything in their tests back in spain before the athlete traveled out
2915223 we dont know how many tests she underwent but obviously she didnt pass the last one were examining the case

2915225 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2915226 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2915227 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2915228 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2915229 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
2915230 r us inc say they will stop selling baby bottles made with the chemical next year and the maker of the hard plastic nalgene water bottles announced in april that it would stop using the chemical
2915231 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2915232 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2915233 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2915234 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance

2915244 the palestinian leadership has been working on establishing a palestinian state within the 67 borders
2915245 if israel continues to oppose making this a reality then the palestinian demand for the palestinian people and its leadership would be one state a binational state
2915246 vamos a reunirnos con el ministro de relaciones exteriores el ruso serguei lavrov y con el presidente medvedev
2915247 the issues that will be addressed at this meeting ultimately affect our community thursday june 12 2008
2915248 after consultation of the entire board may i submit the name for approval of the name of giovanni also known as bunny sgabmelluri as the next superintendent of education
2915249 i would agree to take every alternative to try to resume his career this guy was greatness
2915250 very few guys are of that caliber it gives him something to work for
2915251 right now im planning to throw my bullpen session on tuesday
2915252 really frustrated i wanted to keep pitching but i had to deal with it
2915253 weve been through this before but as important as it is to us he deserves to have his career so im more concerned about him
2915254 it was just a weird kind of deal i think he got stepped on or he stepped funny
2915255 i feel bad for him because he came in and worked really hard and was going to push for a lot of playing time
2915256 were obviously light at corner and were light at safety now
2915257 i dont know how long carter is going to be out so certainly weve got to keep our eyes open for secondary
2915258 he misses it so he wanted to come stay in a dorm again
2915259 i was glad he was able to make it i told him id like him to come spend a couple of days and have him visit with the team one of these nights before we leave
2915260 and i want to pick his brain about 99 as coaches weve all got to kind of stick together
2915261 we can say we were part of one of the biggest events in sports history
2915262 theres no better feeling than playing on the biggest stage in the world
2915263 four years ago we werent getting no cheers from nobody
2915264 its something we miss out on a little bit because of our status
2915265 it just shows how global the nba game is and how big the game is here
2915266 it was a picture perfect way to have the olympics start
2915267 last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17
2915268 it was a different kind of energy it was bigger than the game
2915269 we have a saying back home that when youre good you play for the name on the front of your jersey instead of the name on the back
2915270 our guys all play for the name on the front of their jersey
2915271 why not shoot for higher than that why limit yourself
2915272 all stuff like that does is distract you it distracts your team it distracts the players what you need to do is play this game this series as good as you can and whatever the numbers are you say this is what we are right now were plus 11 you look at this game we let get away this game we didnt score enough here we are you start something other than the game youre playing you get in trouble
2915273 the dream is were going to have that hot streak its coming
2915274 the reality is were trying to win today and to win the series
2915275 when id get sent down in st louis no one ever told me what i was supposed to work on
2915276 it wasnt like it was anything mean but i was going crazy trying to figure out if i did something wrong did i step on someones toes when i first came up with st louis things were ok it just seemed like it progressed from there
2915277 i tried to throw the next pitch and i felt it again so i decided to make the call
2915278 discomfort definitely made me cut the next ball off and wouldnt let me throw the ball the way i wanted to throw it
2915279 i knew it wasnt right so i didnt want to push it the thing that made me feel a little bit better was i was able to do all my cuff exercises my strength is fine i had no other soreness
2915280 youve got to be concerned but the shoulder was good and thats something of importance
2915281 i dont know how injured carpenter is we saw what could happen if he is healthy
2915282 he had 60 pitches through six that was vintage carp it was the carp we remembered from two years ago obviously well wait to see what the injury is
2915283 thats kind of what carp does right there hopefully we can have that and its not that serious an injury
2915284 im working on the rotation for the first 10 days of september you want to see what you do with those four off days carp is one of the pivotal guys when you make the decision on how its going to work
2915285 we were looking for a huge lift from him so far weve gotten it this is definitely not good news to see him leave the game
2915286 they hit a couple balls hard just beyond izturis i dont think we lost our heart we just made an error it happens it wouldve been nice to stay close it wouldve been a exciting second half of the game
2915287 im disappointed i couldnt win it but it was good fun
2915288 i struggled in the middle of the round and they deserted me then
2915289 i knew if i holed the shot i would probably win the pga
2915290 if i missed sergio would probably win the pga so it was down to that and i hit a lovely putt
2915291 it was oakland hills and there was no carnoustie here
2915292 its a different major and you know i gave it all that i had i felt like i hit a great putt on 17 it just didnt want to go in
2915293 it is a big step now to move up and start competing on a different level
2915294 im world no 2 now ive got phil ive got tiger ahead of me
2915295 its a long way to catch tiger at the top but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is focusing on me continually strive to improve thats the only thing i can ask of myself
2915296 it was just what we didnt do as far as run fits closing off gaps and wrapping up and making the tackles it was just little nuances
2915297 what happens is you might play two runs good but you give up a long run and thats what kills us thats hindered us before the long play in the run game we can certainly utilize that as motivation that weve got work to do there
2915298 it doesnt matter whos in there or in what part of the game
2915299 its going to be tough for us to win if we give up that many yards rushing to anybody
2915300 were going to have a heck of a challenge based on what happened at tennessee as far as the running stats going against a team thats going to try to run the ball i promise you this next team san diego is going to try to run the ball
2915301 were going to get it fixed this week in practice
2915302 i think youre going to see a vast improvement in our run defense from this week to the next
2915303 weve got to pick up that part of our production
2915304 i think our certainly got the ability to play well weve got good personnel there
2915305 theyre giving great effort but its production that counts and they know it and theyll get a lot better
2915306 bottom line for linebackers is youve got to be lined up right
2915307 youve got to get the right fit and then youve got to get the guy tackled we didnt do that we didnt do a good enough job of that in this game
2915308 school officials did contact the guam police department they came to the scene and so far everything is ok
2915309 t he decline in support for obama toward the end of the campaign seems to imply the hesitation in american society to accept a black as a presidential candidate

2915415 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out

2915460 were delivering state of the art products at price points that our competitors cant match
2915461 to introduce new products that initially cost more because they deliver an entirely new level of value to the customer we have some of these types of investments in front of us that i cant discuss
2915462 normally when they introduce a new category it takes some upfront development costs
2915463 i believe when they introduced the early ipods they said something similar about impacting the margins it appears they have something really new in the works
2915464 we believe apple is getting slightly more aggressive with its pricing
2915465 if you look at apples products the iphone the ipod touch whats next

2915469 e mail is used as a self validation tool by people to procrastinate and to re create activity vs productivity
2915470 we all felt that information overload was something that was such a big problem that some companies were beginning to be aware of it but a lot of people didnt realize the magnitude of the problem
2915471 distracted the erosion of attention and the coming dark age
2915472 yet were connecting in thinner more faceless ways we experience fewer visits fewer telephone calls fewer contacts all around except e mail were subsisting on this diet of snippets and glimpses of each other socially
2915473 if were having feelings with someone else that we need to confront
2915474 many times well resort to an e mail rather than take the risk of picking up the phone and calling its a very egocentric act its dumping and it gets really misunderstood
2915475 its very clear that green energy is now front and center in the minds of the business sector

2915492 the true charm of pedestrianism does not lie in the walking or in the scenery but in the talking the walking is good to time the movement of the tongue by and to keep the blood and the brain stirred up and active the scenery and the woodsy smells are good to bear in upon a man an unconscious and unobtrusive charm and solace to eye and soul and sense but the supreme pleasure comes from the talk

2915498 the market over the next four years kept going down and down it was not kind to any start up company it was specifically not kind to dot com internet based companies and it was particularly unkind to a financial services internet company
2915499 i realized the wall of communications had been broken down
2915500 now it not only matters what people were saying about companies and candidates but now you had to respond directly to them in real time
2915501 web sites have begun to accept that people want more ways to interact with them than by just clicking around and filling in forms
2915502 its about trying to stay relevant as people get used to traveling through a more fluid web
2915503 when i go around and give talks it seems like people dont really understand their risk of being the victim of insider sabotage
2915504 if you have it then it can happen to you
2915505 when these things happen it forces us to focus on it
2915506 im sure were all looking at this in disbelief and everybody is going to go back and visit their layers of security

2915510 it was like we had control of the house but we were unsure of which rooms he had access to
2915511 we didnt know to what extent he had access or if there were potential vulnerabilities in the system
2915512 its sort of pretty shocking that they didnt have any decent oversight of their own network
2915513 forget whether this guy was planning any bad actions what happens if he has a heart attack and they need to access the system thats just crazily bad management but its not uncommon management

2915519 im thoroughly enjoying test match cricket and hopefully a haul will come at some stage
2915520 its stood me in good stead because i think after about 10 one day internationals i only had about five wickets and at that time i was thinking about how i was going to get international wickets and after 30 ive got 40 odd now
2915521 not getting wickets at the start of my international career is not something im panicking about you learn how to get international wickets and hopefully this is a start that can spur me on
2915522 at the oval with the massive square its quite a quick scoring ground and if we get a head start and bat well we should knock off 197
2915523 the bowlers have not really been where they can be so this will be a good chance for them to hit their straps and bowl like we know they can

2915529 readers digest in big print thats what they all want
2915530 we went from spending 4 700 per month on fuel to 7 200 per month that has been a pretty significant impact on our budget and on our ability to continue the program
2915531 this is a unique time when were experiencing both the rise in gas and food prices ive not seen it like this before where i just didnt have a plan couldnt think of how we could make it work
2915532 i think we all know the cost of food isnt going down it will require creative thinking
2915533 for some clients its not an issue to deliver less but the ultimate effect for the people who really rely on the human contact it could be devastating
2915534 im on a level playing field with my clients ive learned so much and ive been given so many things
2915535 the most heartbreaking thing is to see them removed from their home
2915536 aging is about relinquishing like giving up driving and its hard they have taught me how to persevere
2915537 its my home the two things i want are a car and a girlfriend id like a car so i can take her for a ride
2915538 hes always someone to talk to hes turned out to be a good friend
2915539 certainly with gas prices mortgage issues the strength of the dollar people are wondering where their next paycheck is going to come from

2915548 i see parents when their children are dismissed or when they come to see a concert but i dont see those faces in the classrooms
2915549 a lot of times parents think anytime teachers are coming to the house its because their child has done something wrong
2915550 even at parent teacher conferences some parents come in almost prepared for you to tell them whats wrong with their child
2915551 its a chance for us to come to families and ask to be invited into their world
2915552 one issue as a teacher is that you never have enough time in the day or week to get done what you need to do so theres a little question about how were going to fit that in
2915553 but every teacher realizes how important and how valuable it is its a great extra information gathering opportunity for the teacher and the family if it works the way its supposed to
2915554 what we found was that there was a pretty pervasive cycle of blame at schools
2915555 parents were saying that if the kids werent succeeding it must be the teachers fault teachers were saying they were working so hard that if the kids were not succeeding it must be the familys fault
2915556 that whole discussion took 20 minutes but in that amount of time you can learn a ton about a child and about how families approach education
2915557 she got really excited and wanted to show her teacher her room
2915558 we just sat at the table and talked it didnt feel rushed at all
2915559 for me its no longer territory that belongs to the school its where my comfort zone is and its a chance for them to see the kinds of things that are important in our lives
2915560 a lot of learning occurs in the home environment and if they can get insight into what our childrens interests are outside of school they can really use that to ignite learning
2915561 there was a time in the past when educational philosophy was that a kid came to us as an empty vessel and the wisdom of that child and that family was not considered valuable for academic purposes
2915562 but what we know is that we should be trying to figure out what life experiences parents have had and how they have influenced their children because they have a wealth of knowledge to share

2915571 theres not been a major music dedicated online social gathering spot for musicians fans clubs venues and record labels to connect and interact together until now
2915572 myspace and facebook are clear leaders in generic social networking today and have educated the market but they are entirely horizontal so they dont cater well to niches of specific interest this is where global music connect excels

2915592 due to the serious allegations that have been raised regarding cuppys failure to honor various contractual commitments and your apparent decision to cease our communications i have determined to suspend your accredited status with the aafd pending consideration and action of the aafd board of directors
2915593 in that the aafd board of directors next meeting is set for september 4 2008 i am acting to immediately to suspend cuppys accredited contract status pending action of the aafd board i am causing this action to be published on the aafd website and to appropriate media all listings of cuppys coffee will forthwith be removed from the aafd website and we are instructing cuppys management to remove all references to the aafd from its website and franchise marketing literature
2915594 our purpose remains to inspire fair contracts and collaborative relationships and we are open to negotiating and mediating effective relief for all cuppys franchisees in a manner that will effect restitution from injuries and will allow cuppys coffee to achieve the corporate goals set by new management upon its acquisition of the company
2915595 the path to a successful resolution of the cuppys quagmire is through communication negotiation collaboration and if necessary mediation the path to certain destruction is to ignore the problem and face an inevitable and costly litigative path
2915596 having more information available to the business community about the virtual assistant industry will give a better view of how the industry operates and how virtual assistants can help small businesses grow
2915597 thousands of writers reporters and journalists have access to the virtual assistant industry survey it gives them all the information they need to write the articles and profiles that more accurately portray our profession and educate our marketplace thats why it is so very important that every virtual assistant take a moment to participate
2915598 successful small business owners come from all walks of life
2915599 but as different as small business owners can be they usually exhibit a few fundamental traits that are common among all successful business owners
2915600 my companies pride themselves on staying current with the latest internet marketing techniques

2915611 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2915612 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2915613 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

2915615 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2915616 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2915617 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2915618 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2915619 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2915620 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2915621 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2915622 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2915623 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2915624 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2915625 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2915626 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2915627 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2915628 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2915629 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2915630 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2915631 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2915632 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2915633 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2915634 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2915635 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2915636 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2915637 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2915638 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2915639 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2915640 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2915641 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2915642 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2915643 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2915644 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2915645 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2915646 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2915647 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2915648 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2915649 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2915650 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2915651 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2915652 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2915653 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2915654 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2915655 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2915656 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2915657 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2915658 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2915659 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2915660 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2915661 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2915662 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2915663 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2915664 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2915665 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2915666 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2915667 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2915668 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2915669 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2915670 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2915671 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2915672 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2915673 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2915674 a lot of people said this was the weaker of the two relays
2915675 the four of us set to do something that not many people thought we could do i know a lot of people on our team really stood behind us and really wanted us to do it we set the goal and we went after it and we werent afraid of the pain
2915676 who has the fastest relay times in the world this year not us
2915677 we definitely dont look at it like pressure on us
2915678 two seconds better than the prelims world record relay will not win
2915679 its unclear i didnt hear it so im not going to speculate but we know that they are a force to be reckoned with
2915680 i believe in the coaches i believe theyre going to put together the fastest relay they can if it doesnt work out for me then ive got 2012 right
2915681 we could see them out there near the wire falling right on top of each other
2915682 nobody can tell that story better than the veterans that is why we have such a drive to get this story told
2915683 all total there was a reinforced chinese regiment of approximately 3 600 enemy trying to kill just over 100 of us
2915684 in the first few years of the 1970s he single handedly redefined the sonic possibilities for black music in the process opening up the album market as a commercially viable medium for black artists such as marvin gaye stevie wonder and curtis mayfield
2915685 honestly we hate it when this expletive happens because we want our fans to have any new songs first
2915686 ive done all i can its out of my hands
2915687 the body of a chinese man was found lying on a bed in the rear bedroom of the property and the body of a chinese woman was found lying on a bed in the front bedroom
2915688 police including senior crime officers pathologists and other specialists are now working to establish the circumstances surrounding the deaths and are conducting forensic examinations
2915689 i am very shocked i cannot see if we should live in this area any more
2915690 offered a tremendous opportunity to sell additional products and services to their existing clients
2915691 kami sangat bangga dapat menjadi bagian dalam perkembangan pariwisata di sini dan saya yakin ambon akan berkembang secara pesat dan akan menjadi kota tujuan wisata populer di dalam waktu dekat di dalam dan di luar negeri
2915692 this kind of thing is ludicrous that such errors could be permitted to occur and not have controls in place to prevent them occurring
2915693 while we dont want to go off the deep end about a single error the fact is corporations arent being careful enough with consumer data and are not being held to account
2915694 where there is a real risk of serious harm occurring as a result
2915695 a mandatory data breach notification scheme gives individuals the information and opportunity to protect themselves against fraud and identity theft it also will provide a strong incentive for agencies and organisations to ensure that they secure their databases in full compliance with the privacy act
2915696 were glad you could play sq iv as usual you have been a real pant load
2915697 regardless of good intentions when third parties have a monetary interest in such sensitive information it introduces an opportunity to potentially abuse the system
2915698 any payment for vulnerability research edges the industry onto a slippery slope
2915699 you need to work with the affected vendor to show them the flaw and explain how the flaw works if theyre not aware
2915700 typically whats found are more of the low grade vulnerabilities because the ones with real potential make more money through the black market
2915701 there has been an industry a black market with a lot of these types of exploits for a number of years and dont think theyre going to stop now
2915702 i know many of the senior people in many of the vendors and they dont work like that
2915703 the biggest difference between wsl and other security vendors is that once the vulnerability gets purchased by the traditional security vendor only its paying customers are warned about its existence
2915704 wsl on the contrary by placing the information of a new vulnerability on an open marketplace provide s free of charge warning for all the world
2915705 we at wabisabilabi think that the way vulnerabilities are handled is often very unfair for researchers and that this being a market it should be driven by a market oriented approach
2915706 the highest bidder could very well be somebody who wants to exploit it for harm to community in general
2915707 these people are trying to avoid all of that by going to the story
2915708 its a sign that there is still a lot of work to do from our side i take it as an encouragement
2915709 were glad you could play sq iv as usual you have been a real pant load
2915710 weve had some really good figures and good arrests but this is primarily about reassuring the public and disrupting illegal activity
2915711 we believe our water and waste water services will continue to represent outstanding value for money this is a draft plan we are keen to get a wide range of views before details are finalised
2915712 we need to do something about it its getting worse
2915713 i really believe this is the tip of the iceberg
2915714 there is no interest in schools or police pretending these things are not happening in the past i have relied on anecdotal evidence but it is good to have some hard evidence of this problem
2915715 these figures show weapon carrying by young people is relatively low in our region and equates to less than one weapon being found in each school every 20 years
2915716 but weapons should not be carried at any time and we are working with schools to make young people aware of this
2915717 the police obviously have these figures they should not really rely on the m e n having to go through foi to release them
2915718 everybody is served well by this information coming out the m e n have done a good service to the community hopefully now head teachers principals and education authorities will take appropriate action
2915719 carrying weapons is becoming acceptable i really believe we need to do something about it
2915720 unscrupulous critics have at various times suggested that congestion charging will be extended to the district towns and that a typical payment would be 8
2915721 there are obviously no plans to extend charging to the districts towns
2915722 i cant wait to box at the m e n arena after seeing how many people came out to see me my fans are amazing and id like to thank them for taking the time to come out and support me i usually train in private but its nice to show the public some of what i do
2915723 theres been an improvement already and ill be getting better in the coming months
2915724 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2915725 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2915726 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2915727 investor sentiment has turned positive and we have falling oil prices to thank
2915728 we have reached some areas that had been isolated for two days
2915729 we are focusing on finding the people still missing its bad we are afraid they are dead and well have to recover their bodies
2915730 the traffic jams are very serious and many vehicles and passengers are stuck
2915731 local inhabitants face many difficulties because there is not enough food
2915732 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2915733 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2915734 siamo abituati al fatto che vi siano paesi fascisci che non consentano libert di espressione alcuni paesi pi piccoli hanno dittatori che decidono di bloccare il nostro sito perch possiamo contribuire a diffondere informazioni che potrebbero essere loro dannose
2915735 abbiamo gi cambiato ip per il sito web e questo consentir laccesso da met dei provider vorremmo che tutti spingessero i nostri amici italiani a cambiare i loro dns ad opendns in modo che possano bypassare i filtri degli isp questo consentir loro anche di bypassare altri filtri instalati dal governo italiano come bonus
2915736 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2915737 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2915738 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2915739 organizational structure and the diversification discount evidence from commercial banking
2915740 a new coach brings a little bit of uncertainty but at the same time some excitement giving everyone a chance to compete
2915741 there is a lot more focus competing as a team not just on the football field but all the time we want to be excited for a teammate when he does something well
2915742 its not always about the strongest person but the team that pulls together
2915743 all of these types of competition bring the players closer together guys are relating well together especially getting to know players from different positions
2915744 he talked to the team about what it means to compete which is our theme this year he said his goal everyday in practice was to go so hard that they would have to carry him off the mat i think we were all inspired by being in the presence of true greatness
2915745 a person like dan gable demands respect when he walks in the room
2915746 being a native iowan ive known about dan gable but i never had a chance to meet him before you look at all of his accomplishments and it shows a lot about his heart and the level he competed at it was an awesome experience listening to him
2915747 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
2915748 the global markets are responding well to the cooling off in oil prices and there is at least no immediate fear of interest rate hikes now
2915749 i think the georgian issue is helping the market to focus back on the supply side that has really changed the market quite a bit
2915750 we are of the view that fees should be finalised by the concerned iim boards what is the use of the board if we have to decide on the fee structure
2915751 the basic thrust of the committee is to study and suggest the roadmap on how to create excellence and expand management education
2915752 iims have to raise funding from outside in the us the b schools get funding from corporates the iims can look for similar things here
2915753 now things have changed a lot the economy is growing at eight to nine per cent there is heavy attrition rate in the market each company is trying to attract the better talented professionals by giving huge salary so we will study how to deal with the situation
2915754 apinya cukup besar dan angin kencang menyulitkan kami memadamkan bahkan hampir saja merembet ke rumah saya kalau saja pemadam kebakaran tidak segera datang
2915755 our solid performance reported at the end of the firstquarter has continued throughout the first half of the financialyear
2915756 we have seen a strong operational performance on theoutsourcing contracts and the direct property investmentsportfolio and this has left us in a good cash position at theend of the first half
2915757 with most of the results now out in japan and the unitedstates theres a temporary easing of worries about earnings while lower oil is helping to relieve worry over inflation
2915758 but this is just temporary relief worries about financialinstitutions in the united states are likely to crop up again and with hedge fund results coming out next month investors willgrow nervous once more
2915759 wl ross is one of the largest and the most experienced investor in the world with this investment we have no doubt that spicejet will fulfil its promise of emerging as indias leading airline

2915767 argues that the national enquirer is more reliable that the mainstream press even though its the latter times is more trusted
2915768 i would not believe that was all done by people

2915771 i feel sad to be leaving one of the best corporate finance departments in the nordic region but i have received a very attractive offer after 20 years on the sales side it will be exciting for me to work on the buy side
2915772 our work is a team effort and handelsbanken corporate finance has the top team in the nordic region i am convinced that we will continue to be the leader on the nordic market this is especially due to the very strong commitment from handelsbankens central management the regional bank heads and the board in my 13 years at handelsbanken i have not experienced a stronger support for corporate finance than that we have had in the past year
2915773 we have a clearly defined task from group chief executive p r boman handelsbanken capital markets shall be the leading investment bank in the nordic region the groups very stable finances and the cooperation that has been developed between the branch offices and capital markets give us a unique position
2915774 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2915775 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2915776 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2915777 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2915778 you told me more about the process than i know
2915779 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2915780 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2915781 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor

2915808 its a retaliatory measure against mr h ssy based on what he published on his site the group we think is behind it is the same one that has been swamping switzerland with malware emails over the past 12 months
2915809 the rbn is a rather heterogeneous conglomerate the group involved in these e banking attacks which h ssy was warning about is known to have used the rbn infrastructure its probably not a direct member of the rbn but it has ties to them
2915810 i wouldnt say the situation is getting worse in switzerland most of the security alerts were related to the group sending spam to attack swiss e banking users its getting more professional specific and targeted
2915811 leur musicalit leur camaraderie leur amiti et leur compr hension

2915834 onze integratie met omx verloopt vlotter dan verwacht en de integratie van phlx is goed op weg ondanks de sluiting van de transactie twee weken geleden deze integraties gekoppeld aan de geplande overnames van de boston stock exchange en bepaalde activa van nord pool bieden ons een platform voor het sturen van blijvende effici ntie en verbeterde prestaties dit jaar alsook in 2009 en daarna

2915845 the unprecedented mass appeal of the new rock n roll gave the singers a voice in public affairs
2915846 what if the musicians themselves and various other leaders and founders of the movement were every bit as much a part of the intelligence community as the people who were supposedly harassing them
2915847 particularly after the police riot in chicago in 1968 when so many people got injured but on the whole the movement activists looked on hippies with disdain
2915848 some on the left even theorized that the hippies were the end result of a plot by the cia to neutralize the anti war movement with lsd turning potential protestors into self absorbed naval gazers
2915849 there were all these activists you know berkeley radicals white panthers all trying to stop the war and change things for the better then we got flooded with all these flower children who were into drugs and sex where the hell did the hippies come from
2915850 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit i missed a lot of things you know

2915855 our situation is serious and it is deteriorating with the passage of time
2915856 the financial condition of the u s is worse than advertised
2915857 what makes it even more impressive is the fact that its a summer film and its taking on all competitors and prevailing in such a profound way
2915858 the 40 million for us was just like wow we couldnt be happier
2915859 everything about this movie has just played out really well
2915860 theres a stigma attached and while i could dispel a lot of that if given the opportunity its that first initial access thats the problem
2915861 but thats by no means an inclusive number there may be more
2915862 were not medical doctors but we are economic ones and business is a war that theyve lived a different version of
2915863 if we can give them economic freedom and help them bring themselves and their families back to normalcy well be there for them
2915864 we had been ramping up and we were throwing human resources at our growth and then we hit the wall in late fall
2915865 weve had to pull back this year just for the sake of trying to be smart about expansion
2915866 almost universally business spending is being scaled down to the absolute bare minimum
2915867 a few months ago all those people were talking about a second half recovery if theres a second half recovery its the second half of 09
2915868 you had record high profits but hiring remained very lean throughout this expansion
2915869 an economic slowdown is always going to choke off business investment but this time we could get several quarters of very low spending
2915870 perform background checks on all your employees do not rely on a trusted individuals recommendation obtain information about potential employees from an independent third party

2915872 if more than half the total debts are business related virtually anyone qualifies for chapter 7
2915873 we have no plans to insert money into either of those two institutions
2915874 given that fannie mae and freddie mac are solely involved in housing thats their sole business and given the magnitude of the housing correction weve had its not a surprise to me to see those losses
2915875 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products
2915876 once the jolt hit we were like frozen and watching the doors thinking do we stay or do we go

2915886 it would be hard for abc not to make a play for leno
2915887 he is still at the top of his game and the thinking is that a lot of ad dollars would follow him to another network
2915888 there was a widely held perception that the show would fail without ted koppel
2915889 very few people thought the show would survive and even fewer thought it would thrive
2915890 the show is starting to matter again just as it once did
2915891 my hope is that we are going to see nightline enter a new golden era
2915892 we make a nice amount of money we are doing significantly better from where we were just a few years ago
2915893 a more narrow audience and a more narrow group of advertisers
2915894 it could never survive with such differing lives one home one out on tour again we may never come back the strike of a match the candles buring at both ends
2915895 economic interests that states seek to promote include the right of an individual to reap the rewards of his or her endeavors and an individuals right to earn a living

2915901 officers are working to establish the circumstances of the deaths and the identities of the deceased
2915902 everyone is shocked the police have the house cordoned off
2915903 ive never seen that car before but the police loaded it into a lorry covered it in tarpaulin and drove it away
2915904 the yearlong prelude to the beijing games has seen a major crackdown on free speech and dissent a massive sweep of undesirables from the host city and increasing abuses of ethnic minority tibetans and uighurs

2915906 im really proud of myself to be honest i ran a race a few weeks ago and i wasnt that good and it wasnt as competitive as this
2915907 to win a competitive field like this against a lot of people who are older than me and a lot more experienced means an awful lot to me
2915908 its really good i wasnt quite sure how i was going to go today because ive just come back from some altitude training and im on a high mileage and so i havent dropped any training for it
2915909 but i just thought i would go out and see how i feel and its a personal best as well so im really happy with it
2915910 this is the first time ive ever done anything like this and it was a really good experience
2915911 it was brilliant and with it being the first time it makes it even better
2915912 im really proud as i was the youngest of all the top three
2915913 this is a wonderful community event for the town and something which we look forward to each year
2915914 through peoples generosity we raise about 4 000 and it is one of our biggest fundraisers
2915915 a lot of these types of road runs have disappeared because of the cost of road closures and that sort of thing but with darlington borough councils support for events within the community weve been able to keep this one going hopefully for many years to come
2915916 its a really fantastic event its great to see people coming back year after year for the big race
2915917 weve had 1 128 people enter which is a record entry the feedback again has been very positive
2915918 i think were doing things the right way but were always striving to improve on the previous year and well continue to do that again

2915931 after several years of running the businesses as two completely separate and distinct operations we recognized a tremendous opportunity to serve customers much more effectively by combining the strengths of wms and seamobile wireless
2915932 under this agreement we greatly expand our wireless coverage footprint and bring the benefits of over 300 worldwide roaming agreements to the legacy seamobile wireless fleet this will allow a vast majority of mobile phone customers worldwide to use their wireless phones seamlessly when aboard cruise and ferry ships that provide wms wireless voice and data communication services

2915937 we are in a tough pool and have to win every game so i am definitely happy to win this one
2915938 i had barely settled into my coaching box when we scored the first goal it showed we were not nervous
2915939 i cant be happy when we missed so many goals it is unacceptable at the start of the tournament we had seven penalty corners and wasted all of them
2915940 it makes it difficult for us now but we will fight all the way
2915941 i am not surprised we had problems getting into the game at the start
2915942 we have a young team and for many of them it is their first olympics so a bit of nervousness was natural but once we settled down we just got better and better
2915943 maye we should not have lost by such a big margin but this is the first time they are playing at the olympics

2915952 the hold a heavy thematic and stylistic influence over villianaire
2915953 mode of embedding a great deal of content subdermally into their songs
2915954 also a lot of their content grapples essentially with the tension between being a fairly degenerate type of dude and trying to maintain higher aspects of your intelligence and consciousness

2915959 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other
2915960 for this record we wanted to try and write cold stark club music but inject them with warm romantic pop songs
2915961 our musical idols were pet shop boys the eurythmics bronski beat bands that make pop music first but are heavily influenced by the club sound they wrote really beautiful catchy pop songs yet their beats were right at home on the dance floor

2915969 i do not believe that people choose their sexual orientation any more than they choose their skin color or gender so to discriminate and deny them equal protection and equal opportunity under civil law because of these natural traits especially in this case sexual orientation is grossly unfair and should be rejected outright in a compassionate and just democracy

2915995 my administration has been engaged with both sides in this trying to get a cease fire
2915996 100 focused on solving this peacefully we respect georgias territorial integrity and we expect russia to do the same
2915997 would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2915998 this situation could be resolved peacefully so they have held that door open
2915999 this statement ambassador is absolutely unacceptable particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to civilian populations in iraq afghanistan and serbia

2916057 i cross highway 520 at least five times a week and have never seen the bridge open for a pleasure boat during daytime hours
2916058 what made this even more irritating was that this seemed to be a highly inappropriate decision as this was seafair sunday and the i 90 bridge had been closed which had already gummed up traffic to begin with
2916059 we halted traffic opened the bridge closed it and reopened the highway 520 span to traffic in 29 minutes

2916099 i got out of my car checked the bird over and could tell it was injured and in shock so i picked it up and brought it home long story short nothing appeared to be broken just very badly bruised with a few cuts and he had all his pinfeathers so i decided to try to nurse him back to health

2916103 on july 18 id had him for seven days and he was getting very strong
2916104 after a short wait his parents came to meet him he was so excited to see them he puffed himself up shook all over and then as quickly as he came into my life he flew off with his mom

2916137 neben den einsparungen die sich mit automatisierten kunden servicesystemen erzielen lassen profitieren viele unternehmen vor allem von der 24 st ndigen erreichbarkeit aus kundensicht ist aber auch die geschwindigkeit mit der ihre frage beantwortet wird von vorteil
2916138 in deutschland werden automatisierte kundensysteme erst seit zehn jahren genutzt obwohl viele firmen wissen dass sich investitionen in diesen bereich auszahlen und sich die kosten in der regel schon in einem jahr amortisiert haben besteht insbesondere bei kleineren unternehmen noch ein nachholbedarf
2916139 w re das spiel zeitgleich mit dem kinofilm gestartet h tte es sich in der zwischenzeit locker vier millionen mal verkauft und 100 millionen dollar an zus tzlichen ums tzen eingebracht
2916140 es ist in der videospielbranche inzwischen durchaus blich dass videospielumsetzungen fast zeitgleich zu den kinofilmen auf den markt kommen
2916141 its called a receptor because it interacts with a hormone in this case a hormone called gm csf
2916142 and when that happens it can cause uncontrolled growth and thats what
2916143 at the moment many leukaemias are treated with chemotherapy that destroys the diseased blood cells and bone marrow as well as normal cells
2916144 we hope that this discovery will lead to targeted therapies more specific to the malfunctioning cells seen in diseases such as leukaemia
2916145 i think thats a real positive of this work it could target those diseases that are just untreatable at the moment or very difficult to treat
2916146 little to no chance of conceiving on our own maybe get another opinion im so sorry
2916147 to be sure an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like any other but in herself she is more important than all the hundreds of other roses because it is she that i have watered because it is she that i have put under the glass globe because it is she that i have sheltered behind the screen because it is for her that i have killed the caterpillars except the two or three that we have saved to become butterflies because it is she that i have listened to when she grumbled or boasted or even sometimes when she said nothing because she is my rose
2916148 we are facing reality we know that washington has its own agenda in mindanao and that this has mostly to do with terrorism
2916149 however if the american interest is really in pushing this peace process then we can talk about military bases
2916150 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2916151 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2916152 he listened politely i cant read his mind but i do know that every time i met with him i pressed the point
2916153 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally
2916154 its like saying that you didnt know that a physician was a perfect lunatic at a hospital the expectation is that a hospital would have sufficient monitoring to detect lunacy

2916156 theres nothing we can say its ongoing litigation said justice department spokesman charles miller
2916157 i think that anyone who is handling materials like this has a very heightened duty to make sure that they remain in a secure environment and that duty also extends to hiring employees who would be working in that environment to make sure that they are of sound mind
2916158 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2916159 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2916160 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2916161 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2916162 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2916163 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2916164 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2916165 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2916166 for foreign funds equity is definitely no longer the preferred asset class
2916167 they are quite wary of it and indian ipos do not fit their strategy now
2916168 it all depends on market sentiment there is clearly a flavour for public sector stocks but pricing is the key
2916169 will a large ipo be subscribed yes but the question will be is there anything left on the table for investors to make money after the listing
2916170 there is a wariness towards taking fresh positions in indian offerings
2916171 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2916172 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2916173 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2916174 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2916175 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2916176 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2916177 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2916178 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here

2916185 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2916186 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2916187 at this time were focusing on the health and welfare of the guests involved in this tragic accident

2916227 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
2916228 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
2916229 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
2916230 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
2916231 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
2916232 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

2916278 if i still have luck i would come back and die on thai soil like every other thai person
2916279 what happened to my family and me is like fruit from a poisonous tree
2916280 there is a continuation of dictatorship in managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
2916281 in the most reductionist terms i am paid to come in with my bass and play these notes
2916282 we have tremendous numbers of members who are absolutely struggling
2916283 even very prestigious musicians are hard pressed to make ends meet
2916284 the combination of studio work and residuals is more than a third of my income
2916285 there is a pool of work out there and it ebbs and flows
2916286 its a real abuse of trust for me it stinks
2916287 whether theres a violation of the law the city attorney will have to decide
2916288 i am not sure this works for a new start up fund particularly as we are out trying to fundraise
2916289 i also dont believe alan should be making such decisions
2916290 the whole purpose of the law was to remove that conflict where people who formally worked for him would feel obligated to help him out
2916291 theres a stigma attached and while i could dispel a lot of that if given the opportunity its that first initial access thats the problem
2916292 but thats by no means an inclusive number there may be more

2916303 every year they come in and they say were used to performing with a band and an audience and this is a very different experience for us
2916304 so weve given them a band this year and a full audience so they shit their pants when they walk in with their band and their audience and they have to sing boom straight away
2916305 weve reacted to what the contestants have been whingeing about for a few years
2916306 its a much better idea than having a big band night who gives a shit about that id rather have a kelly rowland night or beyonce night or something a little bit fresh

2916341 from the beginning of third day we realized that we needed to have someone to speak into our lives as individuals and as a band through the years we have had many people pastors and friends travel with us but of all those people nigel james has been the most important he has allowed us and reminded us to be men of god first and as a result our music and ministry have reflected that nigel has kept us accountable to each other to the church and of course to our lord he has helped us to grow in our faith and has reminded us to stay focused on our calling and on what third day is really all about
2916342 how did you get the job of third days road pastor
2916343 for just as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts
2916344 at another paramount theme park third day talked me into going on the top gun ride with them a frightening experience
2916345 wow these third day guys must be incredible even their guitar tech is a mighty man of god
2916346 leading a bible study with third day today supposedly didnt think newsboys bus would arrive at the venue in time got here with twenty minutes to spare washed and ate only to find all the guys in third day still asleep
2916347 for the kingdom of god is not a matter of talk but of power
2916348 but we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from god and not from us
2916349 since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be destroyed let us be thankful and please god by worshiping him with holy fear and awe for our god is a consuming fire
2916350 unless her escape included spa treatments at a 4 star hotel
2916351 she took great care of those kids without much help from the fathers and the community respected her for that
2916352 its another example that theres very low value on black lives in this community
2916353 the message i got out of all this is that its ok for police to go and kill in a drug raid
2916354 its frustrating i hate it that i wasnt able to hold them down better than i did
2916355 i thought we had a pickoff play going with richie and there was a serious miscommunication there
2916356 to do it in a situation when we needed a hit and a run is just icing on the cake
2916357 i was looking for the oxygen tank at third base

2916360 i appreciate the question because obviously you take a regular out the ballgame in the middle of the game its going to raise questions
2916361 but i havent talked to jose yet after i talk to him ill find the right words to explain it to you guys but i want to get those words out to him first
2916362 ask the manager i cant say nothing right now i dont know why i need to find out
2916363 every night we come in here after these tough losses and talk about getting that close
2916364 today we took a step backwards we played a real bad ballgame they took advantage of every mistake every pitch r a left up they jumped on
2916365 i just wasnt able to get ahead as much as i would have liked with it
2916366 those three run homers to the eighth and ninth hitter that tells the story right there a lot of times they pop those up
2916367 well give him a mulligan jeffs done a heck of a job catching weve kind of gotten a report all along that jeff is an offensive guy and the defense is a work in progress but hes caught and blocked pitches very well
2916368 the throwings still a work in progress but i thought he had a pretty good throw down there today he had a chance to get an out on we didnt get it
2916369 hes a vital part of our lineup and we want him in there
2916370 any time you take someone out of your lineup thats one of your big guns that hurts your ballclub we cant have that ill address it further after i talk to jose

2916463 jason is the most phenomenal closer ive ever seen in my life
2916464 i just wanted to save as much energy as i could for the relay
2916465 i dont deny and neither does moszczynski that the poles arrival in large numbers genuinely caused resentment some of it possibly justified against government policies but that does not excuse the mail turning poles into villains and dragging them gratuitously into every possible story
2916466 like most journalists i admire the papers professional brilliance which occasionally is used to make points i agree with that should not blind us to the truth the mail habitually uses what
2916467 the piece attracted considerable attention in america and provided the white house with a new and most welcome pretext for having invaded iraq the trouble is that the letter was a forgery
2916468 how did anyone find out stuff before the ancestry insider
2916469 i was able to speak to clients in a friendlier way
2916470 to have those symptoms go away makes a whole change in your life
2916471 with the baby boomers getting where they are its time to shatter all the myths and fears around menopause
2916472 they would put out ideas in their senior leadership meetings and she would be stone faced and stoic and starting to get red and then starting to get fidgety which is what happens because youre physically uncomfortable
2916473 that triggered them being more open about their concerns instead of saying shes not buying in kill the project
2916474 it brought about more cohesiveness to a management team that was traditionally difficult
2916475 its happened in the operating room where sweat is dripping off from under my surgical mask into the sterile field
2916476 ill walk out of the room and take a cold compress
2916477 i dont worry about what people think about me going through menopause im more concerned about what theyll think if they dont know
2916478 usually whatever thought im trying to find is on the page in front of me
2916479 she is so cute she is the universal symbol for sweet cuteness
2916480 i like that she can be applied to any style from princess to punk she pulls them all off she is so basic and simple her likeness always cheers me up you can never be too old for that
2916481 being a grown up isnt about looking a certain way
2916482 paying my bills taking care of friends and family that is grown up
2916483 those things that i liked as a child are kind of the essence of me
2916484 im being true to myself rather than trying to fake the funk for the sake of avoiding some narrow minded view of what it is to be grown
2916485 its not just rampant consumerism to buy something nicer it might seem counterintuitive but it could be more green to buy nicer things
2916486 there is no stigma any more of wearing hand me downs or shopping at salvation army or goodwill
2916487 my way of thinking was if i spent a little more money the items had to go to two more children so id get my dollars worth im sure ive gotten my dollars worth now
2916488 this guy is a liar cheater and lacks stamina during sex
2916489 i totally agree that i did not handle the breakup in the best of ways
2916490 but its not like i had a ring on her finger and left her at the altar im not trying to minimize what i did im just saying that there are things in this world that are way worse its not like i shot her in her leg or something
2916491 a person can be a really good honorable person and someone who doesnt like them can completely malign their character on sites like this with virtually no recourse
2916492 men and women have equal time on the site as far as being able to say what they want and get both sides of the story out
2916493 in a dating situation the man probably has one point of view of what caused the breakdown of the relationship and the woman has a completely different version of events
2916494 dumping it out briefly can be helpful sort of a catharsis but it cant linger and it cant just be pure bashing the guy it has to be some degree of taking a look at what she did or did not do that contributed to it not working thats the balance
2916495 if we had a strengthening of the dollar that would help

2916498 t heyll want to know this would mccain stock the supreme court with foes of roe v wade
2916499 the answer is unclear but probably no while mccain has positioned himself as pro life during this campaign his statements over the years show considerable latitude on the issue
2916500 i think it is outrageous that people give him a pass as they gave george w bush a pass
2916501 it is difficult to argue that the courts opinion is not constitutionally suspect
2916502 a private decision that we would share within our family and not with anyone else
2916503 we have six weeks to play a little bit more
2916504 we had some of the same questions earlier the last road trip was a big monumental one and we went 6 4 this homestand we were going to get well we havent this
2916505 i would say this three game series is an opportunity for us to get things right if it gets away from us then well know where we are at the end of those three games it could be sobering and it could give us something to hold onto and look forward on
2916506 i might be feeling it a little bit but i feel fine when im out there
2916507 im just going to go back and look at film study things and move forward
2916508 his seasons have been fractured and broken up is there fatigue thats a real question
2916509 i dont make any excuses in my career but its difficult because i hadnt pitched for a while
2916510 i left a lot of pitches over the plate and i got hit very hard
2916511 i think were going to give him another start and see where it goes
2916512 we expect better he falls into the category a lot of us are in right now just about everybody in the clubhouse needs to do a little bit better
2916513 that is directed at producing imminent lawless action and is likely to produce such action
2916514 i dont think this is an encouragement to engage in any illegal action
2916515 i think its more of the nature of a political statement we think it should be legalized
2916516 we just wanted to raise the social awareness to something that affects a lot of people

2916669 to be honest it was when i was afraid that people would recognise me that i was recognised much more when i first arrived in london i was much more afraid of that so i stayed in
2916670 but after a while i began to feel claustrophobic and thought we have to get out
2916671 it is no more surprising to be born twice than to be born once
2916672 we now have for the first time in the history of our species compelling empirical evidence for belief in some form of personal survival after death
2916673 you dont think there are some deluded americans hey how about all of us
2916674 everyone here is obsessed with tabloid celebrities and their lives and wanting to be like that just like kim
2916675 in america you have the people who watch the lohans reality show and want to be like dina and ali lohan and live in a house with a throne in it everywhere theyre just everywhere

2916677 when the family came home around one his wifes cousin found him lying on the floor in the basement near a treadmill the treadmill was running so it is believed that he had been working out
2916678 there doesnt seem to be any foul play we dont see anything suspicious about his death there will be a further statement from the hospital about the cause of death
2916679 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out he had sarcoidosis lung disease but it was in remission
2916680 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2916681 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital he was in intensive care the whole time

2916684 when its good no one can touch me and when its bad its a bit better than pete doherty
2916685 people like to make out that i have gone off the rails and disappointed my parents with my music but its not true
2916686 i was never a saint im a human being and i mess up sometimes
2916687 it was blown completely out of proportion i never overdosed drugs for me are something i dont normally meddle in i have tried drugs in my life im not going to deny it but i dont need to go to rehab because i never and will never have any sort of habit with drugs

2916693 when its emptier a bar smells like stale beer spilled alcohol frat house
2916694 the bar is a three times more intense smell than the mccormick place mens room or 15 times more or 16 times more intense odor than a coffee shop and was almost twice as smelly as an animal shelter
2916695 you could place an aroma at a bar that people like they will perceive the environment to be more friendly be happy at the bar and meet more people at the bar
2916696 i have an incredible amount of vintage that ive collected over the years

2916701 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2916702 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2916703 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2916704 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2916705 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2916706 business and consumer confidence is at its lowest level now since the recession in 1991
2916707 this is just one of hundreds of thousands of businesses in australia that represent collectively the energy and the enterprise that is the foundation of our economic prosperity in australia
2916708 one of the reasons we stay very closely in touch with small business is not just because so many people from our side of politics come from a small business background but because small business is the largest employer in australia
2916709 crucial to the coalition reconnecting with small business making sure that our policies reflect their needs
2916710 by and large if youre a politician and youre not out there then you need to some serious brushing up
2916711 to speak directly to their elected representatives about how things are in the business community
2916712 its not a government promise or a government plan its an unsolicited proposal from the private sector
2916713 you dont just sign up to something because somebody outside of government comes along and goes well heres a good idea
2916714 if they can make this work and still protect the service for the people of the western suburbs at a reasonable price then we certainly can have further discussions
2916715 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2916716 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2916717 hey whatd you do with the money i gave you

2916765 youve got to give gifts to get anything done these days when zhou dixuan and chen aimin get out theyll settle your hash
2916766 the diary is out there and zhou dixuan has been arrested but apart from zhou and his wife theres been no legal proceedings brought against anyone else and zhou himself might not be charged with bribery
2916767 we wanted to restart normal company operations here but now it looks like thats impossible
2916768 xianglian had more than 300 outlets bringing in annual profits of more than 2 million losses are serious now that things have stopped
2916769 get together twenty or thirty thousand and ill help you get a wholesaler license
2916770 but zhou dixuan said that chen aimin had to have rmb 20 000 more than the two of us or else we could forget about the company
2916771 at first he didnt know that you could make so much money in this business but then he asked around and discovered that it really had a good future if business was good then it wouldnt be unusual to make 10 000 a day there was lots of room for profit so he changed
2916772 chen aimin was the companys legal representative and her husband zhou dixuan was the companys legal consultant who also was deeply involved in company operations their daughter zhou hong was nominally the company accountant but in actuality it was chen aimin who handled the accounting her skills were limited leading to frequent errors and omissions this caused the companys operations and financial affairs to be joined into one monolithic entity whose management was imperfect and only nominal under internal control
2916773 i knew right away that the company was a mess but it really did have a bright future
2916774 zhou jianming youre an entrepreneurial whiz who can take this company red hot when you join up the company will be run according to your ideas under digital control
2916775 the real length of my contract was less than 20 days which were all profitable
2916776 but this was just something to make the scam go down easier
2916777 to get me out earlier so i could spend the holiday with my family zhou dixuan and chen aimin took rmb 40 000 from me to pull some strings
2916778 contractors may work together to build relationships with administrative departments all such expenses are the responsibility of contractors themselves
2916779 after spending so much time with the kids in the kindergarten hes an honest man he always felt that if he put his heart into making those payments hed be able to win over zhou dixuan and his wife
2916780 its all because i wanted too much to make the company better but there are too many time bombs buried in it otherwise i wouldnt in the straits i am now
2916781 you cant take this theyre suing us and if you take these receipts youll be sorry youre guilty of sending gifts too
2916782 no bring the rest of them with you tomorrow and ill give you a real receipt for them all
2916783 zhou jianming never listens let me take care of him
2916784 it was important to stay alive so i didnt want the bag any more i ran down the stairs and heard zhou dixuan shout sanyazi if that schemer tries to make any trouble i want you to kill him
2916785 the tax business administration and public security bureaus sent core members to take part in the case so the number of participants was actually more than just twenty
2916786 its been many years since weve seen so many provincial and municipal leaders paying such close attention to a single case though the amount of money involved isnt all that much it could have an extremely harmful influence
2916787 youve got to give gifts to get anything done these days when zhou dixuan and chen aimin get out theyll settle your hash
2916788 its obvious that this is revenge lots of people are intentionally making things difficult and whenever i look them up they treat me like the god of pestilence and avoid me true they no longer take our gifts but its still difficult to get anything done
2916789 thats what society is like these days its impossible to avoid sending gifts

2916795 over the past four years sony bmg has undertaken a very successful restructuring streamlined operations and developed innovative digital partnerships that ensure it will continue to be a leader in the creation and distribution of music worldwide it is an organization rich in talent ideas and enthusiasm and is a strong fit with our overall business strategy
2916796 after a careful and thorough review we made the strategic decision to sell our investment in this joint venture to sony a step that we believe will benefit the stakeholders of both our companies
2916797 this move is consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas sony has been an excellent partner and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential we look forward to witnessing sony music entertainments exciting future under sonys ownership

2916808 this kind of thing is ludicrous that such errors could be permitted to occur and not have controls in place to prevent them occurring
2916809 while we dont want to go off the deep end about a single error the fact is corporations arent being careful enough with consumer data and are not being held to account
2916810 where there is a real risk of serious harm occurring as a result
2916811 a mandatory data breach notification scheme gives individuals the information and opportunity to protect themselves against fraud and identity theft it also will provide a strong incentive for agencies and organisations to ensure that they secure their databases in full compliance with the privacy act
2916812 regardless of good intentions when third parties have a monetary interest in such sensitive information it introduces an opportunity to potentially abuse the system
2916813 any payment for vulnerability research edges the industry onto a slippery slope
2916814 you need to work with the affected vendor to show them the flaw and explain how the flaw works if theyre not aware
2916815 typically whats found are more of the low grade vulnerabilities because the ones with real potential make more money through the black market
2916816 there has been an industry a black market with a lot of these types of exploits for a number of years and dont think theyre going to stop now
2916817 i know many of the senior people in many of the vendors and they dont work like that
2916818 the biggest difference between wsl and other security vendors is that once the vulnerability gets purchased by the traditional security vendor only its paying customers are warned about its existence
2916819 wsl on the contrary by placing the information of a new vulnerability on an open marketplace provide s free of charge warning for all the world
2916820 we at wabisabilabi think that the way vulnerabilities are handled is often very unfair for researchers and that this being a market it should be driven by a market oriented approach
2916821 the highest bidder could very well be somebody who wants to exploit it for harm to community in general
2916822 these people are trying to avoid all of that by going to the story
2916823 its a sign that there is still a lot of work to do from our side i take it as an encouragement
2916824 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible

2916826 ive been a part of the two teams at the last two olympics that came out behind and i think i wanted it more than anybody not just for myself but to show that we are the nation to be beat in that relay
2916827 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
2916828 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
2916829 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
2916830 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again

2916840 the point of being involved in the pac process is to build relationships with these individuals to help them understand what walmart is doing to be a solution provider
2916841 really the pac giving at both the federal and state levels is generally not a one hit wonder but is more along the lines of working long term with these officials
2916842 i cannot recall any particular issue theyve approached me about
2916843 just about any issue you can think of touches them in some way
2916844 they havent come to us with any earth shattering burning issue that they say this has to get done
2916845 its the state level policy that affects what they do
2916846 its the legislatures that determine zoning laws theyre the ones that write the right to work laws

2916860 this is a whole new recipe both visually and to its taste as well
2916861 even just seeing one color of an m amp m helps say ooh thats something different
2916862 some of the first creative i saw was very serious and indulgent and treated the product like this very rich new m amp m thing
2916863 my fear was i didnt want to do just the product shot and be devoid of the humor and fun of the brand

2916939 this is the closest a film of mine has come to my initial vision since it is a remake of a short i made as a teen the challenge was to illustrate my growth as a filmmaker which i think it does while more serious in tone than previous works the film sticks with classic fcs themes
2916940 this film has all the hallmarks of a great fivals corn shank production
2916941 from the campy and memorable use of cats to the subtle homage to jean cocteau it gave me chills the first time i watched it
2916942 i am very excited about the launch of our new site

2916945 the energy mining services and financial services sectors will soon appear on private equitys radar as sharemarket turbulence drives down prices according to a leveraged buy out consultant ernst amp young private equity leader bryan zekulich says sectors that have historically had low levels of private equity involvement are now more likely to be sized up
2916946 we expect to see pe private equity take advantage of good buying opportunities created in the current economic uncertainty basically sound but temporarily distressed assets that investors have lost faith in but these opportunities have the potential to yield high long term value
2916947 most of the time in markets it pays to follow the money but with the miners you follow the people
2916948 but i reckon what the pirates are after are good projects they can buy at a discount with commodities prices doing a major correction and taking share prices with them its going to leave some amazing projects really vulnerable to opportunistic players im watching for takeovers and i dont really care whos doing the taking over as long as were in good projects we should do alright

2916958 in this audience are sisters coping with every situation imaginable some of you have never been happier others are grappling with unseen ordeals weeping into your pillows at night then putting on a brave smile and facing another day i know ive experienced both it is because of the range of our experiences that we as women can be a tough crowd we sometimes pounce if a speaker doesnt say just what we want to hear but here is the reality we each have our customized opportunities to deal with disappointment yet our disappointments dont change the doctrine none of our lives are perfect and neither are we nonetheless in the spirit of not offending or overwhelming one another it can be tempting to water down the message

2916960 als wir die sd times 100 preistr ger 2008 aussuchten haben wir die produkte dienstleistungen und den ruf eines jeden unternehmens mit entwicklungsleitern er rtert und die neuen ideen und f hrenden konzepte die das unternehmen in der branche einf hrte ber cksichtigt
2916961 unternehmen wie jetbrains sorgen daf r dass die kunst und wissenschaft der softwareentwicklung sich weiterhin so schnell entwickeln kann
2916962 diese auszeichnungen sind insofern besonders bemerkenswert als es die anwender selbst sind also die diese produkte tagt glich einsetzenden an vorderster front stehenden entwickler die die produkte ausw hlen die sie in der jeweiligen kategorie f r die besten halten
2916963 he said the only thing stopping him was his girlfriend he was worried she would think it was a bit too chavy
2916964 walking is good if you want a relaxed journey to work i generally find if i walk to work i feel more active when i get here
2916965 the thought of reducing congestion and improving air quality is a great incentive and lots of health studies show regular exercise each day can help with weight loss and improve the condition of your heart
2916966 we are offering adult cycling lessons to staff things such as where to position yourself on the road and the consideration of pedestrians but its a real push to get people to use alternative modes of transport to work
2916967 i recommend using a bike to anyone going to and from work in cambridge and commuting on the train
2916968 there used to be guards vans attached to the train which would accommodate lots of different items including bicycles but putting all the items on then taking them off at another station would slow down the trains and take far too long
2916969 now of course it is absolutely right that non folding bicycles should be banned on peak trains
2916970 generally though cycling is an invigorating way to start your day and get to work i would thoroughly recommend it
2916971 its a huge advantage to be able to cycle in london as in cambridge because the journey time is totally predictable
2916972 if you travel by train bus or car there are lots of factors which could result in delay
2916973 more than a quarter of people who work in cambridge cycle to work it is by far the highest figure for any place in the uk
2916974 think about it what would the congestion be like if cyclists chose to drive to work
2916975 what i find it difficult to understand is why motorists are hostile to cyclists we are in effect making roads emptier for them to use

2916990 das zeigt dass bayern gerade in einem dynamischen wirtschaftssektor wie der medienbranche ein ausgezeichneter standort mit gro em markt und gesch ftspotenzial ist
2916991 dank seiner st rke in allen segmenten der medienbranche der wachstumsdynamik im bereich digitale medien und seiner schl sselposition f r die deutschsprachigen und osteurop ischen m rkte wird der medienstandort bayern auch in den n chsten jahren weiter in und ausl ndische direktinvestitionen anziehen

2916993 innerhalb einer region wird f r einen wirkstoff ein unternehmen den zuschlag erhalten bisher waren es bei den bundesweiten ausschreibungen pro wirkstoff drei oder vier firmen
2916994 wir erhoffen uns von den neuen vertr gen bei gleicher qualit t der versorgung einsparungen f r die aoks im h heren dreistelligen millionenbereich pro jahr einen teil davon h tten wir gerne bereits in diesem jahr realisiert was uns aber durch das rechtliche hickhack verwehrt blieb
2916995 bis ende oktober sollen die eingegangenen angebote eingehend gepr ft und anschlie end unverz glich die zuschl ge erteilt werden damit den neuen exklusivpartnern der aok gen gend zeit zur vorbereitung bleibt durch die modifizierte vorgehensweise bei der ausschreibung bin ich zuversichtlich dass die neuen vertr ge p nktlich zum jahreswechsel starten k nnen

2916997 die mauer wurde nicht nur zum symbol der deutschen teilung sie wurde auch zum symbol f r ein wirtschafts und gesellschaftssystem das die eigenen menschen einmauern musste weil sie zu tausenden t glich davongelaufen waren
2916998 offenbar wurde unter uns in den familien in den schulen und auch in der politischen ffentlichkeit zu wenig ber diese zusammenh nge gesprochen
2916999 wir werden uns nicht gegenseitig helfen wenn wir uns jetzt auch noch beim erinnern an die eigene vergangenheit gegenseitig belehren wollten aber einige zusammenh nge m ssen deutlich bleiben die mauer am 13 august 1961 ist nicht aus purer freude an schikanen gebaut worden sondern weil t glich tausende freiwillig aus diesem staat davongelaufen sind diesen menschen war die individuelle freiheit zur selbstentfaltung und zur eigenverantwortlichen lebensgestaltung wichtiger als die alles umsorgende staatliche f rsorge auf niedrigem niveau f r diese form der staatlichen begl ckung mussten die verantwortlichen damals ihr eigenes volk einmauern insofern markiert der 13 august 1961 den anfang des scheiterns eines systems staatlicher zwangsf rsorge das eben nur durch die zunehmende reglementierung unter verzicht auf eigenverantwortliche individuelle lebensgestaltung organisierbar war

2917009 he was apparently hit in the face causing him to fall to the ground when the others kicked and jumped on him
2917010 the fight started inside but the guys were removed by the doormen and they continued outside

2917015 we applaud business and society for reducing energy consumption but demand more savings

2917017 there are those who are doing their bit to save electricity but we must get more people in this pool there are still culprits who waste electricity i still see showroom lights on in the metro during the night
2917018 every temporary teacher who is in a vacant post will become permanent for a long time we have not had bulletins to advertise posts this is good news for them

2917032 we shall accordingly continue to pile on pressure until a settlement is reached that is based on our demands
2917033 we want a total isolation of mugabe and his cronies
2917034 generally the feeling is fairly negative especially as employees have not been told about the implications of a single public service their fears are legitimate as municipalities pay more than state departments
2917035 municipal pension funds outperform the state pension fund and employees are worried that the state department could use municipal pension funds to boost their own fund
2917036 i warn you not to be lenient with criminals because they do not respect lives these street committees must not be user friendly to criminals but that does not mean that you must kill just catch the criminals and hand them over to the police

2917066 i have since been to the police station three times requesting that someone accompany me to go and identify the hijackers but they have refused
2917067 i know the assailants and the prostitute they always hang around at the shebeen next to the red lion hotel but the police said they do not have transport to take me there
2917068 i have also been told that the docket was booked out to a detective who no longer works at mount road police station this is pathetic
2917069 the docket is being investigated by detectives from mount road and the superintendent has made a point to go out with the complainant for pointing out the suspects
2917070 the change allows for the streamlining of staff deployment there is no longer security required for cashiers at three separate entrances
2917071 cashiers are able to process ticket purchasing faster which contributes to reducing long queues especially in the festive season
2917072 the salary increments will be extended to items with monetary value on the total package concept applied by telkom such as medical aid
2917073 the fire engine had all its emergency lights on and was busy putting a fire out
2917074 i was told that they had to quickly remove the car away from the truck as it could have caught alight
2917075 the fire engine was on the left side of the road if travelling towards pine lodge there was someone warning traffic on the furthest side of the fire but not the side dale and holly were coming from
2917076 with the smoke so thick and no one to warn them they drove straight into the back of the truck
2917077 the accident occurred when the bakkie attempted to overtake a truck on the old grahamstown road the driver was taken to st georges hospital with a few injuries
2917078 the company has requested the newspaper sunday times to publish a rectification of the article the options of legal action are being evaluated
2917079 if mbeki has a clear conscience about the deal as he insists he does then he will appoint an independent judicial inquiry into the persistent allegations
2917080 im happy that home affairs is treating it as a high priority ill be happier when the document is in my hands
2917081 we will continue to write to him as we accumulate evidence until it becomes impossible for him not to act
2917082 i had parked the car facing western road and was not obstructing traffic but when i returned it had been turned 90 degrees
2917083 the logo on the car definitely does have something to do with these incidents i always get funny looks
2917084 now both the learners and the teachers can be distributed anywhere
2917085 technology now offers incredible flexibility and convenience and is changing the way we view intellectual exchange and the development of knowledge and skills
2917086 in solving an education problem the project is in danger of creating an environmental one
2917087 one started shooting and five people were seriously injured we found 21 cartridges at the scene
2917088 read the papers for potential businesses that are emerging many of the state owned enterprises are selling off parts of their businesses and these represent opportunities for women
2917089 begin by saying there is nothing i can not do power has nothing to do with it education has nothing to do with it the responsibility for your future achievement is yours and yours alone
2917090 the records do not help us so there is no way of knowing how long she malherbe was in an acute state of shock
2917091 her blood pressure was low from after 11am onwards and from noon no pulse rates were recorded at 1pm no observations of the patient were made
2917092 when he van heerden first came to see the patient there was no way of knowing that the cause of shock was due to bleeding its not reasonable to expect him to make a diagnosis simply by looking at the patient medicine simply does not work like that
2917093 the terrible crime and the inspiring responses have put unitarian universalism under an intense media spotlight
2917094 and we now find ourselves called to publicly define who we are and what we stand for now is the time to let the world know that we will continue to stand on the side of love even and especially during these challenging circumstances
2917095 we were called in to monitor his progress and made the call to bring him to safety after seeing the conditions
2917096 the sea conditions were really bad and we were getting soaked out there
2917097 it took us one hour to get to him and seven and a half hours to get back to the harbour thats how rough it was out there
2917098 could you ever imagine that wed be here living in estcourt driving back home like this with two of our boys
2917099 theyve been very supportive we can call on them for anything
2917100 we hope the time will come when we can give back to them
2917101 one thing that i discovered when i started this work
2917102 was that this district is crisscrossed by chains of helpfulness first madison helped fox valley who in turn helped carbondale who in turn is helping two emerging congregations
2917103 we do the things that are easy for us but hard for a new group
2917104 by doing this weve gotten a sense of supporting a larger vision of unitarian universalism it can be difficult to be a religious liberal here theres a lot of pride in my congregation about doing this
2917105 i needed advice from others and that was exactly what i got they sent very thoughtful and lengthy responses that really helped me and influenced our decisions
2917106 it would have worked better if the church had been truly committed to growth and not so wary of the relational processes for facilitating it
2917107 its a minister to minister relationship mainly about our congregations trajectories of growth i think of fox valley as being five to ten years ahead of us so theyve experienced much of what were growing into
2917108 we know from our own experience what a difference the presence of a unitarian universalist congregation can make in this area not only the powerful difference it can make in the lives of its own members but the impact that it can have on the community and the region when we saw these groups working to develop uu fellowships nearby how could we not want to help
2917109 there is no suitable memorial or plaque or wreath or wall or park or skyscraper lobby
2917110 and because such a place doesnt exist that i know of the book had to
2917111 you mean this is what im going to be when i grow up
2917112 i know ive never read a book like this because who can write it
2917113 its hard to figure out how a congregation as a whole is doing
2917114 we find the impact of this event has a lot of different layers and people were impacted in different ways
2917115 the first issue was to rededicate the sanctuary and just be in there and tolerate the anxiety
2917116 they helped us through the immediate crisis and set up interventions for individuals with severe trauma
2917117 they met with church leadership individually giving them recommendations on a global scale what to look at in the next few months what to look at in the next year
2917118 the euphoria of feeling well cared for is beginning to wind down
2917119 in the initial phase we saw hundreds of people we had counselors at the church from 10 a m to 9 p m and people could just stop by now these people are being referred to local caregivers
2917120 reality sets in there are not as many resources on site and available there can be frustration that the legal process is not as expedient as hoped people can feel like others have moved on
2917121 one person may say they heard three shots another will say they heard two
2917122 in the midst of everything someone put up a map and put a sticker on every place we had received a message of support or letter or email from and the map was just covered
2917123 they have shown forth in abundance people who have written thank you notes people who have cleaned people who have just appeared on the spot and provided necessary leadership
2917124 its made me very proud to be a unitarian univeralist and i dont think im alone in saying that
2917125 what we discovered was that it was about the entire knoxville community our children were their children we had people show up for the memorial service monday night july 28 from the tibetan buddhist center from the synagogues the local mosque and a wide variety of christian churches
2917126 come from churches youd consider conservative liberal and everything in between but they fed us and loved us and didnt discriminate on the basis of race or sexual orientation its been a reflection of overwhelming overpowering love
2917127 i would venture to say that we now know more the value of being part of the uua and the thomas jefferson district
2917128 the uua bill sinkford the uu trauma team and district executive annette marquis have earned all of the dues weve paid since 1949
2917129 gee how am i gonna get started talking to this beautiful nude woman

2917142 this is how i see it man this is a white little cuban guy talking ok
2917143 my entire life as i knew it was disrupted at age 16
2917144 and all of a sudden heres this explanation for everything
2917145 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2917146 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
2917147 it was always going to have to be a part of our campaign for the general election
2917148 sure hes been in washington 26 years but hes always been a reformer always worked across party lines sacrificed his own political interests to do so
2917149 so we were always going to have to tell that narrative because some people know it but not everybody
2917150 he can point to areas where he broke with the bush administration where he broke with his own party
2917151 that part of the maverick image probably isnt going away
2917152 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008

2917163 this guy was an american hero in 1961 he was bringing up deforestation being a major issue he was talking about government not representing peoples interests he was talking about jobs being lost to outsourcing about juvenile delinquency happening because both parents have to work well these are all things that have come to pass

2917171 we love listening to other people talk stuff about us because it just fuels us
2917172 they had talked a lot about it and we would just rather do it in the pool
2917173 i knew it was going to come down to the end and i was hoping to be ahead but i never lost hope i don t know how i was able to take it back that fast because i ve never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50

2917196 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
2917197 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
2917198 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
2917199 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
2917200 i saw katie and thought lets just try to catch her

2917208 we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like what kind of slap in the face is this they are 12 14 years old and they get lined up and the government backs them and the federation runs away there is an age limit and it cant be controlled
2917209 ive been looking for an indicator to let me know where im going to be at and i think today let me know
2917210 i think the blue skies will come especially after sundays rain
2917211 today is raining and tomorrow will have rain too that will help reduce the air pollution level we believe the current air flow will be helpful in the dispersion of pollutants in the air
2917212 this marks a historic victory for india and for the globe indias responsible record in developing its existing civilian nuclear power programme will bring much needed talent and innovation to the nuclear renaissance underway necessary to stem global warming
2917213 us companies look forward to cooperating with indian companies to achieve this important energy security infrastructure build out
2917214 we are encouraged by recent statements made by senate foreign relations committee chairman senator joe biden who says he will find time to press for ratification of the 123 agreement so long as india is able to complete its steps
2917215 usibc and the coalition for partnership with india will be front and centre in this debate to ensure us congressional passage
2917216 fully committed to do everything it can to move the pact forward to its conclusion
2917217 we are all so rejuvenated after the prime ministers decision to go through with it
2917218 we feel so good that finally the congress party had the spine to understand what is good for the national interest and call the bluff of the left
2917219 and i am glad that other parties like the samajwadi party and its leaders like amar singh are supporting the deal
2917220 pull the government down now so i am really delighted at the news that the government is moving forward because as you know and as i had told you the community had given up all hope
2917221 so it is wonderful that finally it is coming through although there are tremendous task ahead to get it through the congress and put in on the calendar before the congress adjourns for the year but at least things are moving
2917222 started to mobilize the community and we have begun to have conference phone calls with people and all of them are feeling really good and as we did earlier we are going to be working together and ive already had a long meeting with the us india business council and the coalition for partnership with india and all the other people and were hopeful that we can pull it through
2917223 it will be a humungous task mostly because of the logistical issue of bringing it back to congress in time for it to be voted on i have already spoken to senator joe bidens people and ive talked to congressman garys ackerman people and i am going to go and see all of them next week
2917224 will be the key players to get this done in time
2917225 so we have started the process already and we are going to bring back all the people all the community leaders to once again put their shoulder to the wheel to get this done
2917226 true they were all disappointed frustrated angry when things were not moving in delhi but we are indians after all and when it comes to the motherland we always come forward so i am confident we can bring all the people back together
2917227 its not a case of the majority vote in the house and senate we know we will get that but its just a matter of time and whether there will be enough days in the congressional calendar to get it done in this session and of course all of this depending on how quickly india can send back the 123 agreement and how soon the us can get the nsg nuclear suppliers group to endorse the deal
2917228 we are also trying very hard and trying to put some pressure on secretary of state condoleezza condi rice to bring back former under secretary of state and chief us negotiator of the agreement nick burns back as a consultant to pull it through because hes the guy who understands this deal inside and out and he understands the nsg and the entire process and its very close to his heart
2917229 hes worked very hard on this and he has great rapport with the key players in congress and so hes the ideal person to have at this moment to get it done and so its crucial that we have him back
2917230 we have been closely following the breaking developments including the very positive joint statement by president bush and prime minister manmohan singh
2917231 obviously when the ball comes back into the court of the united states congress the us business community through the us india business council and its coalition for partnership with india will be at the forefront pushing for speedy and expedited ratification of the 123 agreement
2917232 this is just a huge and extremely important and historic opportunity not just for our countries but for the globe indeed this is an energy security imperative and its an environmental imperative good for all nations
2917233 so its about time that indias nuclear isolation is ended and us industry will be front and centre on capitol hill when the ball returns into our court to ensure speedy ratification of the 123 agreement
2917234 the violence in nandigram is tragic that said our companies know the bengal governments intentions for nandigram are progressive the purpose of developing the chemicals hub is to create thousands of jobs
2917235 if we are allowed to invest our companies will look forward to working closely with the affected local communities and make certain that those who have sacrificed their land and their livelihood will have the greatest share in the future opportunity
2917236 ethics is the study of making right and wrong choices
2917237 how might friedas story help us reflect on those who made the wrong choices
2917238 its real sad but there were just too many people who thought the jews should be killed thats just how it goes
2917239 if you cant say rounding up 6 million people and killing them because of their religious belief sexual orientation physical or mental abilities is wrong then you are not an ethical person you are a chicken and the world doesnt need any more chickens the world needs more ethical people who are willing to stand up for what they believe in and make a difference and hopefully that difference includes concern for the lives of other people

2917242 the problem is whether the sperm cells are functional or not i dont think there is an ethical barrier so long as its safe we are in the process of applying for ethical approval we are preparing now to apply to use the existing bone marrow stem cell bank here in newcastle we need permission from the patient who supplied the bone marrow the ethics committee and the hospital itself
2917243 we want to test the functionality of any male and female sperm that is made by this way
2917244 our next goal is to see if we can get the spermatagonial stem cells to progress to mature sperm in the laboratory and this should take around three to five years of experiments
2917245 were very excited about this discovery particularly as our earlier work in mice suggests that we could develop this work even further

2917260 when we saw the number of shot corners we had and the number of penetrations we had we had more than the u s a
2917261 the team have to look forward because its the first game and we had a point
2917262 we were a little bit on the back foot to start and argentina made us pay for that
2917263 our team is known to persist throughout the game regardless of the situation or the time or phase of the game

2917268 he wasnt getting as many repetitions as i know he would like to have
2917269 he has not said anything about it he has not complained i know that anybody thats played wants to play more so i felt at this time to give him an opportunity to hook up with another team and possibly play for somebody

2917310 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan the only result of the use of the airstrike is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
2917311 the government had given about 800 muslim guerrillas until friday to vacate several villages they had occupied
2917312 the world is like a family so these things make every people feel sad
2917313 this was an isolated criminal act we have no reason to believe the action was targeted on any specific nation

2917316 i enjoyed it its our first time to see nba stars so exciting
2917317 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
2917318 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
2917319 i have no regrets of anything i did out there
2917320 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2917321 ive had a lot of ups and downs in the last eight years
2917322 missing the olympics in 04 was hard and to get to another olympic final well well see what i can do tomorrow morning
2917323 being on top is a great place to be but you can learn a lot from the ups and downs when youre not always on top
2917324 you learn a lot more about determination and perseverance and i think that although its not always the best position to be in when youre not on top it really brings out the best in people when youre able to push through that you find out what youre really made of
2917325 making the olympic team was a really big success in my eyes after not making it in 04
2917326 and now that im in the 08 finals im really excited about that
2917327 i looked forward to making this for a very long time so i feel excited to be back in it i think its going to be an uphill battle to medal tomorrow but im definitely up for the challenge

2917336 but there was like 5 seconds on the clock i was like stay down big guy lets get this one over with get on the plane and get home
2917337 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
2917338 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
2917339 the four of us set out to do something that not a lot of people thought we could do
2917340 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
2917341 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
2917342 youve got to tip your hat to somebody that does something like that in a pressure packed race like that
2917343 i just got to go home and take care of myself its going to be a tight final natalies just so good at racing and planning out her races so i just expect nothing but fast fast swimming tomorrow morning
2917344 its exactly where i wanted to be going into the finals im happy with that i just need to recover and focus on my final
2917345 there could be a heck of a run on snapple
2917346 but nobody could hear him because there were a thousand drunk students behind him going wooo hooooooo
2917347 i wonder if i could swing a deal on the times herald record press box seat below the leaky pipe at shea
2917348 theres nothing quite like a steady drip tapping against the computer on deadline
2917349 pete wanted the fish to gobble him up so he could swim up and down the river
2917350 i wonder if he had a mets cap in his golf bag
2917351 trying to find something wrong with his game is like picking lint off an armani suit
2917352 if i have it figured correctly when its noon here its 1 a m tomorrow at the olympics and sometime last night on nbc
2917353 of course there will be pressure the only thing i can do is overcome it
2917354 i hope the pressure can become the motivation and that i can be very calm
2917355 it was not as relaxed and easy as it looks because we actually worked very hard every day training from morning until night
2917356 the last dive may not have been perfect but it was not a failure
2917357 but im sure china will come up with someone new
2917358 its the perfect time to make mistakes to get the nerves out we have our world title from last year and we feel like we are the world champions and we want to show the world that

2917364 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2917365 i never could get the runs in the right spots
2917366 i needed to stay with him to be close enough to try to make a move in a braking zone we never could get close enough to get an opportunity
2917367 i was a little nervous having tony behind us and sitting there for so long
2917368 i wondered if we were going to have a flat spot on the tires i wondered what we were going to do how we were going to get good on the restart when i was going to turn the brake fans on and what would i do if i get down in turn 1 and somebody gets alongside you
2917369 fortunately it turned out to be the easy way we got a good restart pulled away and went from there
2917370 it was a big hit for a bunch of guys
2917371 i found some guys that wanted to go down in there and hit somebody
2917372 they discovered day before yesterday that hes got a hole in his lung
2917373 people should sit down and talk instead of going into war
2917374 i had a real specific mri and doctors even said i had a slight strain in my tendon
2917375 i could have taken the line of the shot but that would have put me in the stands or i could have gone back to the tee i had to go in there and try to hit something i tried to hit a 3 wood and i didnt get it out
2917376 it was my first time in the last group in a major and i dont think it will be my last time
2917377 im disappointed for j b holmes but hes still on my radar
2917378 the wind was really starting to blow so i tried to hit a low 4 iron that was the strongest iron i had in the bag
2917379 it started off perfect and i said be as good as you look then when it landed i called out go in the hole
2917380 the guys just cracked up when it went in especially since i called it
2917381 if i get onto that world team the money and all that will fall into place
2917382 its very frustrating because it seems every year that my progression as a quarterback has been halted by injury
2917383 with the prospect of ben not being available you see heightened intensity at the quarterback position
2917384 everybody is understanding that holy cow this could really happen i could be in there when that happens its amazing how the light turns on and people really start focusing
2917385 hes playing well no doubt hes got a lot of talent his forehand is huge it will be interesting to see how he does he certainly has the weapons it depends on how he builds on it
2917386 if i want to be in the top 10 i have to beat them elite players on every surface and im beginning to do that
2917387 oh shit man he totally roundhouse kicked that guy in the face
2917388 man that chick totally has a british accent lets give her another oscar
2917389 it is psychologically interesting to know that it does one good to
2917390 coach z pretty much called out the plays that were going to be the plays that stand out in the game
2917391 thats two weeks in a row when you get that belief and that excitement its good to see
2917392 there were a couple of plays during the week that i said when i get here im calling this play and its going to be successful when i call it and it sort of happened you know it did it happened
2917393 i want to practice winning for me as a head coach
2917394 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose
2917395 economic activity continued its seesaw pattern of recent months as real gross domestic product edged down 0 1 per cent in may after rising 0 4 per cent in april
2917396 overall the canadian economy is slowing and loosing momentum as we move into 2008
2917397 we had a decline of 0 3 per cent in the first quarter of 2008 the preliminary data weve seen since the first quarter says growth could fall on either side of zero in the second quarter
2917398 the increases in apartment and row house construction were not enough to offset the declines in single family and semi detached homes construction and in alterations and improvements work
2917399 in the non residential sector the drop in industrial building construction was only partially offset by the increases in commercial and public buildings
2917400 we have been operating at a high level of activity on the construction side so even a slight pull back means there wont be growth
2917401 the sector has been slowing modestly from a superheated level i dont see a big drop off or a sudden collapse of spending but i do see a cooling off and expect to see this continue over the balance of the year construction firms will still be busy
2917402 with facilities in calgary and edmonton burnco concrete significantly expands the con force divisions standard product offering in alberta and further extends our product diversity
2917403 an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
2917404 they should read the contract the contracts are coming out with a number of unfair clauses the contractors are bidding in a very competitive market and sometimes they ignore some of these clauses that may become real issues or disputes later on
2917405 sometimes owners and contractors are very optimistic then they experience delays that get kicked up to the dispute level
2917406 having one allows the owners to monitor the progress of the project even though they may prepare detailed specifications the owners often dont employ the proper personnel to monitor them
2917407 it is also good for the contractor by consulting the schedule he can identify the risk factors and provide contingency plans further he can use the schedule to monitor the progress and substantiate delay claims
2917408 diesel fume exposure has been a concern for some time
2917409 the objective of this research is thus to study the prevalence of heart disease and diabetes in relation to diesel exhaust exposure while controlling for personal risk factors such as smoking and obesity
2917410 we believe there could be a connection between diabetes and heart disease and exposure to diesel fumes and if this proves to be true we can then inform regulators and manufacturers as to what needs to be done
2917411 i am going to get a white one for each of my friends

2917420 girls in the infirmary suffering from bruises on their bodies
2917421 the inspectorate believed that what they were told on these issues was being followed through and the systematic abuses we read about in this report were issues that they did not think were happening anymore
2917422 i think maybe i only know one thing in this world one thing for sure and that is that the truth does not set you free the truth does not salvage you or make you whole again it does not allow you to rise above the burden of lies and secrets and wounds to the heart the truths i have learned hold me down like chains in a dark room an underworld of ghosts and victims that slither around me like snakes it is a place where the truth is not something to look at or behold it is the place where evil waits where it blows its breath every breath into your mouth and nose until you cannot escape from it this is what i know the only thing

2917446 the point of being involved in the pac process is to build relationships with these individuals to help them understand what walmart is doing to be a solution provider
2917447 really the pac giving at both the federal and state levels is generally not a one hit wonder but is more along the lines of working long term with these officials
2917448 i cannot recall any particular issue theyve approached me about
2917449 just about any issue you can think of touches them in some way
2917450 they havent come to us with any earth shattering burning issue that they say this has to get done
2917451 its the state level policy that affects what they do
2917452 its the legislatures that determine zoning laws theyre the ones that write the right to work laws
2917453 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot this year has just been phenomenal its just crazy
2917454 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2917455 i never could get the runs in the right spots
2917456 i needed to stay with him to be close enough to try to make a move in a braking zone we never could get close enough to get an opportunity
2917457 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
2917458 i knew that he was going to be good we both came in together and left together and that was probably the win right there to be able to beat him off pit road once we did that i kind of got up through the esses better than him and we pulled away
2917459 it was just nice to have both sides of the ball operating efficiently to start the game
2917460 you can say something was wrong with him but he hasnt missed a beat this year
2917461 coach fox and general manager marty hurney did a great job of bringing in guys who are big we talked about beefing up the offensive line
2917462 last year we went up to philly and we laid an egg we were awful
2917463 i had to make sure i got back here this year
2917464 if you going to make some birdies on this course it is going to be on the front nine
2917465 i just wanted to get out fast and make some shots and give myself a chance
2917466 but i bogeyed the first hole and that just got me off to a bad start
2917467 i missed two short birdie putts on no 5 and no 6 and then just missed another putt on no 7
2917468 a lot of my putts were just over the edge by the time it was crunch time on the back nine i had dug myself too much of a hole
2917469 i knew even par on the back nine would be great
2917470 you can make a few bad shots on the front nine and get away with it but not on the back nine

2917478 i was happy we had a good car strategy got messed up there at the end
2917479 if the caution hadnt come out wed been sitting rosy

2917484 his original bc which we assume was issued for barack hussein obama at birth would have been sealed at the time of the adoption i suspect that obama may have dumped his indonesian citizenship at some point along the way to advance his political career
2917485 thus if obama actively kept his indonesian citizenship his us citizenship could be challenged
2917486 he really was different from the others he was tall and heavy black skin curly hair
2917487 barack ran somewhere they went he ran somewhere else they followed

2917508 ende gut alles gut das war ein typisches pokalspiel in dem die amateure ber sich hinausgewachsen sind der gegner hat sich nicht versteckt von anfang an mitgespielt und so daf r gesorgt dass es ein unterhaltsames spiel wurde es gab von unserer seite aus viel zu viele fehler im defensivverhalten wir sind aber eine runde weitergekommen das ist das wichtigste dass wir nicht mehr tore erzielt haben hatte zwei gr nde erstens sind wir mit unseren torchancen zu nachl ssig gewesen und zweitens hatte der gegner einen berragenden torwart aber was man auch schon sehen kann ist dass unsere mannschaft gro en willen zeigt das ist die signalwirkung die unsere junge mannschaft braucht

2917527 the figures reflect the considerable adjustment in housing market activity now being experienced we expect activity to remain at low levels for some time
2917528 it is important to recognise we are dealing with an entirely different situation in the market from what was experienced in the early 1990s the fundamentals of the housing market remain strong with high employment low interest rates and long term demand for homes from first time buyers

2917626 she prepared for this race properly she didnt race every week and her race programme was geared towards this she did her homework she did the hard miles when it mattered

2917628 i wasnt the most confident going round the corners in the wet so i thought it was better to play it safe i knew that i could catch them back up even if they went for it at the bottom theyd be strung out and thered be no way they could keep it up for the whole distance

2917641 but i want everyone to be the best they can be and if theyre fat then i say to them then they should lose weight
2917642 every year they come in and they say were used to performing with a band and an audience and this is a very different experience for us
2917643 so weve given them a band this year and a full audience so they shit their pants when they walk in with their band and their audience and they have to sing boom straight away
2917644 weve reacted to what the contestants have been whingeing about for a few years
2917645 its a much better idea than having a big band night who gives a shit about that id rather have a kelly rowland night or beyonce night or something a little bit fresh
2917646 ive been talking about mentors for years im not talking your kate ceberanos im talking your big international stars like big international guests

2917657 i knew id have to go close to my best and thats what i was hoping for obviously to swim as fast as i could to get the guys off to a good lead
2917658 it just felt like quite an easy swim there wasnt much pain involved although i faded a bit towards the end it wasnt painful
2917659 by no means is the next couple of days going to be easy
2917660 i think ive still got a lot of work to do and hopefully find some part of the race to improve on and if i can do that in my other races ill be happy
2917661 over the last four years ive never seen such a big amount of swimmers especially sprinters compete as much and as regularly against each other
2917662 i think thats a big part of where youve seen the depth grow immensely the times drop so steadily
2917663 theres been this group of guys swimming so fast for years race against each other
2917664 all these different series overseas all the big competitions theyre pushing each other to swim faster and faster all the time
2917665 people are just finding ways to do that and to keep bettering the world records and times and finding new ways to sprint
2917666 i think the suits help us feel good in the water
2917667 and if you feel good in the water you can do special things
2917668 i dont think they enhance performance at all it makes you more confident with the way youre feeling in the water
2917669 on balance although inflation is likely to remain high in the near term the rba believes that demand is slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2917670 softer demand outlook also means that the pricing power of firms will weaken in the period ahead
2917671 the clear indication from the bank is that it has shifted to an easing bias and the question is on timing for the first cut we are going for september with 25 basis points
2917672 the flavour of the rba statement does not convey any sense of alarm about the pace of the slowing and the commentary is set in the context of an economy that had been growing rapidly for an extended period which was increasing pressures on available capacity
2917673 it is a credit to them that they fought so hard we were unsettled in the first half but you cant doubt their character
2917674 i think that win showed that we are a bunch of fighters it wont be pretty when we play but we have that aussie spirit and a lot of heart
2917675 we believed korea was a real threat possibly even a gold medal threat along with the netherlands
2917676 so to come out and beat them that is really a feather in our cap
2917677 but we know we have to back up in our next game to even think about a medal
2917678 we knew we were not playing well in the first half it is easy to get despondent when you are down like that
2917679 but i think halftime came at the perfect time for us it gave us an opportunity to re group
2917680 that felt like a final it just really shows the character of our team
2917681 this will be a very positive influence on our team
2917682 too many residents said this group is just harassing any animal they can lay their hands on
2917683 i do know police are looking at links between these attacks
2917684 im confident that the police investigation will ultimately find those responsible
2917685 i would hope that these attacks are being done by a small group of people because i would be very very distressed if i thought theyd become more widespread

2917723 what is happening now is disappointing because it has the potential to put the brakes on a reform that a lot of people thought was promising
2917724 the national perception could be if this whole thing goes south teachers will say procomp didnt work so pay reform wont work
2917725 the he said she said nature of communications to you is not advancing the conversation
2917726 continues to try to directly negotiate with teachers and try to sell the denver public schools bargaining positions to the public
2917727 theyve already proven that its possible to find new ways to increase teacher pay that are developed with teachers not imposed on them
2917728 they seem to be standing in the way of these reform efforts procomp was meant to be a pay for performance system providing incremental bonuses for teachers to take on harder assignments in difficult schools what we have now is a system oriented to base building
2917729 people are sick of this and they want a change
2917730 you are heading toward more sickouts demonstrations and strikes that will be devastating to everyone
2917731 the change that they are asking for takes us right back very close to where we were before procomp where teachers salaries plateau after year 13
2917732 not predictable and not accessible to every teacher in the district its not fair to every teacher in the district
2917733 the largest pay increase in the history of denver public schools

2917754 bagi bli jumlah klub yang ikut liga super 10 atau 18 klub sama saja besar biaya yang akan dikeluarkan juga sama saja jadi demi efisiensi lebih baik 18 klub saja yang ikut liga super
2917755 maksud lolos dengan catatan itu adalah klub yang masih memiliki sesuatu untuk dibenahi misalnya memperbaiki stadion tetapi harus ada bukti nyata bahwa mereka memang tengah berusaha membenahi itu karena liga super akan dimulai pada juli

2917806 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2917807 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2917808 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2917809 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2917810 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2917811 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2917812 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2917813 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2917814 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen

2917826 we had a second crew for about a month in january to see if there was a call volume for it
2917827 from the feedback we got from the first responders they could see a dramatic change
2917828 has a collection rate of 3 percent over the national average
2917829 we would look at a 200 000 or 300 000 a year increase in revenue
2917830 we applied last year and theres 13 million dollars still out there but there were 2 500 applicants
2917831 we are seeing an increase in dogs in our sector helping us get to situations faster and screen vehicles much quicker
2917832 theres wind distracting odors agents working around them other dogs and of course the 1 500 vehicles that drive by every hour
2917833 they do this so my dog hits the smell forcing us to pull the car over for a second inspection while the car with the load tries to sneak by a few cars behind
2917834 any little residue and my dog will alert me to it
2917835 we have no confirmation of how these cars are being contaminated but we are checking each car and when our dogs alert us we check the cars behind it too
2917836 i couldnt even try to explain how these dogs find that one concealed person in a van full of people but they do
2917837 thats the part of the job an agent couldnt do alone thats why we have these dogs working with us every day
2917838 the fitness level of these dogs doesnt compare to a house dog
2917839 these dogs are trained to work hard long hours almost every day
2917840 tusd has been cutting back on programs but tanque verde is still offering art music and spanish
2917841 at soleng tom elementary where the boys had been the pta bought a mobile computer lab for the school there was not enough room for a whole computer lab
2917842 but at tanque verde elementary there is a permanent computer lab a science room i just think it will be a better less stressful education for them and they will get the extras tusd is not able to offer anymore
2917843 they also will have smaller class sizes and that all adds up to teachers who arent as stressed and to a better education
2917844 this year flowing wells did something that we didnt do before
2917845 we sent out postcards about our high school to a targeted area in tusd that was close to our boundaries
2917846 some students leave and come back leave and come back
2917847 were seeing that there are a lot more choices out there
2917848 we absolutely expect to get kids for school from the letter
2917849 it was a straightforward message making families aware that we were now an option
2917850 did not tie our promotion to a tusd related activity
2917851 the majority of tusd resident families who applied to us have children who are not now attending tusd schools
2917852 that all of the rest of the districts have participated in open enrollment for many years now so any significant increase in new application numbers would likely come from a district like tusd that has prohibited participation through local school district governing board policy
2917853 amazed at the number of student applications that are crossing my desk that indicate students returning from charter and private schools
2917854 we always receive students from outside the district each year but i have no sense of how many may have enrolled this year
2917855 i cant wait to see the numbers after the first day of school to assess whether through returning students and students from other districts we have made up for the number of students who have left the district in recent years
2917856 the decision was hard because we were very happy where we were
2917857 its important they are able to go to work in our community and fill the need
2917858 the community had a lot of feedback and that is what weve used to design our program
2917859 old block home that has not been lived in for many years that we need to get it up to code
2917860 we will have just a few animals here those that we need to quarantine until they are healthy enough for adoption or if someone gives an animal back and we dont have a foster home for them
2917861 this is the place where people will be able to interact with animals before they adopt them
2917862 ive done lots of different sports and this is by far the most fun
2917863 when the wind is calm its like sitting on a cloud on your front porch at 3 000 feet you can see everything

2917865 this things going to crest a half a billion soon
2917866 who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time
2917867 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
2917868 phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that
2917869 we think going forward the phone of the future will be differentiated by software
2917870 it gives iphone a justifiable claim to being a viable gaming platform
2917871 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull

2917884 at the moment many leukaemias are treated with chemotherapy that destroys the diseased blood cells and bone marrow as well as normal cells
2917885 we hope that this discovery will lead to targeted therapies more specific to the malfunctioning cells seen in diseases such as leukaemia
2917886 i think thats a real positive of this work it could target those diseases that are just untreatable at the moment or very difficult to treat
2917887 we would go out to heards lane to have picnics
2917888 the combination of a strong australian dollar a restless generation y and affluent baby boomers is fuelling outbound tourism to the detriment of the domestic industry
2917889 unless we get our backyard in shape australians wont want to spend time in it
2917890 its not a government promise or a government plan its an unsolicited proposal from the private sector
2917891 you dont just sign up to something because somebody outside of government comes along and goes well heres a good idea
2917892 if they can make this work and still protect the service for the people of the western suburbs at a reasonable price then we certainly can have further discussions

2917898 none of the commissioners had or had even heard of email there were no mobile phones no digital cameras no high tech surveillance cameras in public places
2917899 no other comparable jurisdiction in the world exempts small business from the general privacy law
2917900 the australian regime is more restrictive than in most comparable countries
2917901 the government needs to pick up the alrcs suggestion that more data can be permitted when government and industry implement a responsible lending framework
2917902 equally however there is need for government effectiveness and for data to be communicated between agencies and government departments
2917903 current common and statute laws strike careful balances between the protection of legitimate interests in privacy and the respect for freedom of speech which has been a hallmark of our legal system

2917915 its a pity and i feel sorry for her kids but she has admitted doing this so shes going to have to pay for it
2917916 having the gambling to reduce property taxes is a good idea but the downside is youre going to have people that are going to become addicted to gambling and find a way to keep that habit going
2917917 unfortunately if you happen to be working in a job where you have access to funds you could be tempted to steal its an addiction just like any addiction

2918388 it looks as if employment costs the main area over which businesses retain control are taking the strain with employers seeking both to keep a lid on pay settlements and in increasing numbers planning for redundancies the labour market is suddenly looking a lot less resilient
2918389 the whole issue was created by separatist leaders who would like to stop the hindu pilgrimage the real motive is a complete islamisation of the valley after having successfully forced kashmiri hindus to leave the valley
2918390 this is not a struggle merely for 100 acres of land this is the struggle for the identity of our motherland
2918391 my wife and i have traveled to reside in england
2918392 if i still have luck i would come back and die on thai soil like every other thai person
2918393 what happened to my family and me is like fruit from a poisonous tree the fruit will also be poisoned
2918394 there is a continuation of dictatorship in managing thai politics which is followed by interference in the justice system
2918395 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia
2918396 here we are trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place
2918397 there needs to be international mediation for the south ossetia issue
2918398 theres no doubt that the stability and calm has created a good atmosphere that has allowed us to make more summer camps and oversee the youths
2918399 some portions of the video were not telecast due to sensitivities and personal attacks
2918400 the video tape was given to ary one television in islamabad on saturday and was telecast on sunday during 5 00 pm regular news bulletin
2918401 the first official message ever in which he speaks english
2918402 calls for the people to support jihad in pakistan and lists a litany of grievances against the pakistani government and us involvement there
2918403 troops had killed 60 ltte terrorists and 28 were wounded from sundays confrontations
2918404 the death injuries and loss due to this attack typical when sri lanka air force bombs a heavily populated area in vanni have been repeated more than one hundred times over the vanni area over a period of two years
2918405 yes its a little disappointing i knew i was in a marginal seat and the fact that the swing has gone against the party has probably cost me my seat
2918406 its another chapter of my life thats closed and well move on from there
2918407 when you take on a job as a minister there are some tough decisions to be made
2918408 i felt that the decisions that were made in my portfolio were for the betterment of the northern territory people its created jobs and its helped the economy and thats what its all about when you step into the shoes of a minister
2918409 the major issues weve got are no different now to what they were before the election including roads and infrastructure and regional health services and a commitment to a live export trade
2918410 its really going to be very important from now on that someone does pay a lot of attention to the issues and listens
2918411 if its a close call in parliament any issues we have on the table will be debated quite strongly thats going to be a natural occurrence when youve got a situation like we potentially may have
2918412 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2918413 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
2918414 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
2918415 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2918416 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2918417 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2918418 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2918419 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2918420 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2918421 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2918422 we come with militaries that have advantages in command and control in speed in lethality in logistics in intelligence in all those things
2918423 if nations provide forces with restrictions what it does is it decreases those advantages
2918424 how fast we can get there i dont know but it is important that the international community remain committed to afghanistan
2918425 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2918426 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2918427 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2918428 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan
2918429 i know feldmans a has been but deluded now youre just being a meanie meanerson gws
2918430 es ist mir nicht entgangen dass wir weniger fortschritte gemacht haben als die teams um uns herum f r uns war die entwicklungskurve zu beginn der saison ein bedeutender schritt jetzt ist sie ein wenig abgeflacht
2918431 no devolv el saque como lo ven a haciendo en la semana esa fue la gran diferencia hubo algunos 30 30 donde pones la bola en juego y sa creo que fue probablemente la peor parte hoy
2918432 el est jugando bien me pareci que jug mejor con respecto a lo que hizo hace un mes en clay en europa no hay dudas de que tiene mucho talento y le pega fuerte est con gran confianza lo que hace la diferencia
2918433 sus armas el drive es muy bueno le pega a cualquier lado en forma indistinta puede golpear a las puntas o corriendo lo que es bueno para l malo para el resto de nosotros
2918434 we are both so happy to have two british girls on the podium it was a lot harder this morning we just tried to ignore the times and race the final
2918435 the statements from the whole group result in a total lack of coherence from which we easily conclude that theyre all lying
2918436 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible to include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents lack of communication is torture
2918437 there is a sense of anger frustration and great sadness theyve waited for this evidence of sightings for a long time its work they could have started 15 months ago but this is the time for them to keep focus and consider everything carefully before deciding what course of action to take then they will have their day they will make their views clear
2918438 i believe he can recommend charges or action be taken against the police as a whole as well as individual officers
2918439 the early stages of the investigation led by detectives in portimao really were very poor
2918440 a number of people had touched the window and entered madeleines and the twins room prior to the arrival of the gnr local police
2918441 her eyes met mine as i walked past and thats when i saw the little blemish in her right eye it was like a little fleck
2918442 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
2918443 one must suppose that the child madeleine mccann could have died inside the apartment
2918444 the whole attitude throughout was one of we think theyre involved there are some vague indications lets throw caution to the wind and see if we can get a conviction
2918445 the documents are a field of potential leads and any one of them could unlock the case they will never give up the search for madeleine
2918446 a network with all kinds of criminal activities really does exist but the authorities dont want to look into it
2918447 in general paedophiles ask for a particular type of abuse rather than a particular child
2918448 the majority of sexual abuse occurs in the home or by people the child knows
2918449 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2918450 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2918451 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2918452 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2918453 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2918454 weve seen nothing that tells us that this mine will not operate at the full capacity for which is was designed
2918455 we believe that investors will continue to seek out precious metals as safe haven in this current global convergence of financial instability heightened economic concern and political tensions
2918456 we have plenty of room here to grow five or 10 times as many oysters it costs money to increase production but if we can we could be looking at some seriously big income
2918457 we would have increased our exports to france straight away if we had the stuff but these deaths were not foreseeable and we havent had time to up our production
2918458 also the french want them a certain size and we sell them quite small so it will take a few years to get them to how they want them
2918459 however its purely hypothetical that the french oysters are dying of herpes its such a common virus that occurs in lots of different creatures and it seems quite an easy disease to blame
2918460 its like saying this animal has got blood in it
2918461 i have a lot of sympathy for the french growers but they will receive some government support which is something i would like to have
2918462 this is not the first time there have been serious oyster mortalities in france or in this country for that matter the growers out there will get back on their feet im sure

2918466 man shot in the back sunday is buffalos 24th homicide victim this year
2918467 to live is to pray an introduction to carmelite spirituality
2918468 i am very excited that the president has come to our village because i have never in my life seen him face to face
2918469 this celebration is special for us in the village of ga motlatla and i want to thank the government for celebrating with us
2918470 after seeing celebrations of this nature it has convinced me that women are receiving the attention they deserve and are getting the opportunities they were denied in the past
2918471 this also shows how government has taken the empowerment of women very seriously and it is up to our children to utilise all these opportunities
2918472 i have never seen president thabo mbeki and the north west premier edna molewa before
2918473 i hope to see them today and i do have a feeling that after their visit our lives as young women of this village will change
2918474 but for us it is a big deal because we dont normally get the opportunity to be exposed to senior government officials
2918475 i am very excited to be here to celebrate womens day in this manner and also to see president mbeki for the first time
2918476 i would be a lot happier if i can get the opportunity to shake his hand
2918477 because of our commitment to ensure power to women our government and legislatures have made important progress in ensuring women occupy their rightful place as leaders of our people
2918478 indeed this progressive advance has also had a positive impact on the private sector organs of civil society and the rest of society
2918479 in all things we do the main challenge has always been the struggle against poverty and underdevelopment
2918480 as we know today the challenge is made more difficult by the ever increasing prices especially of food and fuel
2918481 in response to these challenges and as part of our ongoing commitment to ensure a better life for all the war on poverty campaign will be launched in all provinces this month
2918482 this is part of our commitment to do our work in the spirit of business unusual and power to the women
2918483 43 percent of members of cabinet are women four of the nine provinces are led by women premiers
2918484 at local government level 40 percent of councillors are women and three of our six metropolitan municipalities are led by woman mayors
2918485 of importance is that south africa has already surpassed the initial target of 30 percent representation of women in decision making structures call for in the southern african development community sadc declaration on gender and development
2918486 two households both alike in dignity in fair verona where we lay our scene from ancient grudge break to new mutiny where civil blood makes civil hands unclean from forth the fatal loins of these two foes a pair of star crossed lovers take their lives
2918487 a glooming peace this morning with it brings the sun for sorrow will not show his head go hence to have more talk of these sad things some shall be pardoned and some punished for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo
2918488 first saw the light of day on wednesday 23rd april at five in the afternoon
2918489 a tall woman with magnificent intelligent eyes who knew how to create around herself a warm natural atmosphere

2918491 advance soviet musical culture so as to lead to the creation in all fields of music of high quality works worthy of the soviet people
2918492 odious is the victory that costs so high a price
2918493 a weird work beginning with its title and ending with its music and choreography
2918494 it was during those days that my plan to compose my opera based on tolstois
2918495 what i wanted to put over essentially in the music of cinderella was the love of cinderella and the prince the birth and development of this feeling the obstacles in the way and the realization of the dream at last i attached great importance to the fairy tale side of it which posed a series of interesting problems
2918496 the most excellent and lamentable tragedy of romeo and juliet
2918497 the russians like long ballets which take a whole evening abroad the public prefers short ballets this difference of viewpoint arises from the fact that we russians attach greater importance to the plot and its development abroad it is considered that in ballet the plot plays a secondary part and three one act ballets give one the chance to absorb a large number of impressions from three sets of artists choreographers and composers in a single evening
2918498 in the latter part of 1934 there was talk of the kirov theater of leningrad staging a ballet of mine
2918499 there is no tale of greater woe than prokofievs music for romeo
2918500 some melodic pattern of our own something nearer to our own conception of how the love of romeo and juliet should be expressed
2918501 what is the first name of the woman who cleans the school
2918502 there should be a focus on interventions that works for women
2918503 we are not doing enough for the boy children and i think there is a great danger that we are going to repeat the scenario of the archaic man the way they are today
2918504 we still have a chance with some of the younger men and boys to actually make them take a greater responsibility for the running of the households
2918505 whilst there is a lot that has been done there is still a long way to go as women are still facing challenges of poverty unemployment and under development
2918506 that when we mark the 15 years of democracy next year people should not ask questions like how far we have gone to liberate the country but instead the lives of women
2918507 in that way we would be able to identify what more still needs to be done
2918508 let us look at how can we help the government to further improve the lives of people especially women
2918509 young girls have been given an equal opportunity as men and are studying maths science and information technology
2918510 we need to challenge women organisations to help women achieve a better life for all they must say to the government let us consolidate on the progress weve made and look at what we should do to improve
2918511 following good progress made by the rusaf team with exploration activities on the various properties purchase of the remaining rusaf shares became the next logical step in expanding our exploration portfolio
2918512 the lives of women have changed drastically especially those living in rural areas whose rights used to be violated as they only knew that their place was in the kitchen until the new government came in and made sure that women know and practise their rights
2918513 we wouldnt be here celebrating if it wasnt for those women who fought for us today we are enjoying the fruits of their hard work and dedication towards change in this country
2918514 we have proved to the nation that we can do it and we dont need approval from men
2918515 the women who march 52 years ago paved the way for us and i challenge young women to use this opportunity and make sure that their hard work was worth it we no longer have to feel inferior around our male counterparts as we are strong people

2918518 we had been ramping up and we were throwing human resources at our growth and then we hit the wall in late fall
2918519 weve had to pull back this year just for the sake of trying to be smart about expansion
2918520 almost universally business spending is being scaled down to the absolute bare minimum
2918521 a few months ago all those people were talking about a second half recovery if theres a second half recovery its the second half of 09
2918522 you had record high profits but hiring remained very lean throughout this expansion
2918523 an economic slowdown is always going to choke off business investment but this time we could get several quarters of very low spending
2918524 friedman tells stories well with a keen eye for wars absurdities and his own fading illusions of wars glory

2918534 if he is unable to commit to that then i would think that precludes him from taking up a full time contract of course he can still play when he is available as a free agent for match fees as he did last season
2918535 he wants to play for canterbury which is great the question mark was around how much of it would he be available for
2918536 we brought it down to the boardwalk and put it in a case just to see if people would react and they reacted

2918547 the new plastic staple st9500 system can speed up finishing operations which have traditionally been an apparel manufacturing bottleneck
2918548 the system can increase fastening productivity dramatically compared with other products on the market today
2918549 in addition to fast ticket attachment the st9500 system is also ideal for whiskering and prewashing operations which give a faded or vintage appearance to jeans increasing their perceived value
2918550 this is not the case with existing products introduced over 18 years ago because they were designed solely for attaching waistband tickets and pocket flashers not for whiskering
2918551 also the needle spacing is adjustable so that with just one staple size 12 millimeters the needles can be set widely apart to secure thinner denim layers or set more narrowly to secure thicker layers
2918552 clutches and solenoids typically have high failure rates and are costly to replace
2918553 the st9500 s clutch and solenoid free design eliminates this potential source of downtime and associated costs

2918556 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
2918557 at the end you could see i was pretty excited i was very emotional
2918558 i was hoping to be ahead but i never lost hope said lezak
2918559 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50 meters
2918560 i feel like i should have gotten my hand on the wall first
2918561 i gave it everything i had possible but she got me in the end
2918562 i would be baffled if you do not say that was perfect
2918563 time is something to be smashed anytime but at the moment that i marked 58 seconds i probably should have been happier
2918564 now i have to go and take care of myself tonight because tomorrow its going to be a tight race
2918565 not yet we are not through but we will continue tomorrow
2918566 there is no reason that he should resign everything they are saying is false so why should he resign
2918567 the work of the impeachment committee is almost complete it is giving finishing touches to the charge sheet
2918568 we gave him a chance to resign we gave him a few months but we have come to the conclusion that now the people of pakistan through their elected representatives in the parliament will have to do that
2918569 i feel confident knowing that we did have a few mistakes here and there
2918570 and it was important getting them out of the way here we dont want to have those same mistakes when finals come
2918571 a few days ago chellsie went down and it gave us an obstacle to overcome sam is one of the most powerful athletes we have and it threw us for a loop we wanted to stay calm and know we still had four athletes for each event which is what you need
2918572 i didnt want to take it too seriously thinking it is the olympic games because i didnt want to get that nervous
2918573 its the thrill of my life thats about it its hard to describe i just went for it i knew i was lying in fourth thankfully it went my way and i just went for it
2918574 i was under tremendous pressure and at times i felt really agitated
2918575 early voting allows you to vote on your own schedule it avoids lines at the polling place and its convenient because anyone from anywhere in the county can go to one of the three early voting sites to vote regardless of what precinct they live in
2918576 something could happen late in the race where you might want to change your vote and that wouldnt be possible
2918577 its usually quieter the first week and then numbers start to increase the second week
2918578 i suggest any voter going to the polls or getting ready to vote should go ahead and take a look at their sample ballot and be familiar with the races that will appear on their ballot
2918579 they are welcome to make marks or notes on the sample ballot and take it into the polling place with them if that helps
2918580 what the bolivian people have expressed with their votes today is the consolidation of the process of change
2918581 we are here to keep advancing in the recovery of our natural resources the consolidation of nationalization and the state takeover of companies
2918582 it depends now on how the government proceeds if they push through an aggressive agenda they will see a lot of resistance and maybe violence if hes a conciliator and tries to negotiate hell have a chance of governing with a lot of political support
2918583 the conflict has increased between the president and the regions the president has won but his opposition in the east won by more than the president
2918584 i think were going to be very steady at our early voting sites thats what were preparing for
2918585 but the turnout for early voting is traditionally about the same as in absentee at least in volusia
2918586 of course the primary doesnt really have a central focus theres no one intense issue or candidate on the ballot

2918628 in our earlier study areas of stress were largely located at the outer suburban mortgage belts where car dependency is high
2918629 in this study we have seen the number and geographical range of vulnerable households creep inwards as fuel costs and interest rates rise
2918630 worse the deficits in urban infrastructure and services meant the more vulnerable households had less ability to adapt to higher fuel costs by taking public transport
2918631 across australias cities public transport is bursting at the seams during peak hour which gives clear evidence people will use public transport when it becomes just too costly not to
2918632 public transport use in sydney had steadily declined between 2000 and 2005 but the sharp rise in fuel costs forced commuters onto trains between 2005 and 2007 the number of train journeys jumped by 11 million
2918633 state governments nationwide are debating measures such as underground loops and light rail which is great but will only assist inner urban residents who are already the least vulnerable in society we need to get new trains and buses into our outer suburbs
2918634 since world war ii australias cities have been planned on the presumption that cars running on low priced fuel would be the dominant means of transportation
2918635 the australian senate estimates peak oil to occur by 2030 so a broad comprehensive plan to reconstruct australian suburbs to reduce petrol reliance must begin now
2918636 the number and range of households struggling to cope was spreading inwards from the outer suburbs

2918642 fortunately people often say yes or agree with requests out of mindless compliance
2918643 they are frequently willing to say yes automatically without thinking first it makes their lives simpler and smoother but what most of us are trying to overcome is the opposite phenomenon when theyve programmed themselves to say no without thinking about it

2918725 tusd has been cutting back on programs but tanque verde is still offering art music and spanish
2918726 at soleng tom elementary where the boys had been the pta bought a mobile computer lab for the school there was not enough room for a whole computer lab
2918727 but at tanque verde elementary there is a permanent computer lab a science room i just think it will be a better less stressful education for them and they will get the extras tusd is not able to offer anymore
2918728 they also will have smaller class sizes and that all adds up to teachers who arent as stressed and to a better education
2918729 this year flowing wells did something that we didnt do before
2918730 we sent out postcards about our high school to a targeted area in tusd that was close to our boundaries
2918731 some students leave and come back leave and come back
2918732 were seeing that there are a lot more choices out there
2918733 we absolutely expect to get kids for school from the letter
2918734 it was a straightforward message making families aware that we were now an option
2918735 did not tie our promotion to a tusd related activity
2918736 the majority of tusd resident families who applied to us have children who are not now attending tusd schools
2918737 that all of the rest of the districts have participated in open enrollment for many years now so any significant increase in new application numbers would likely come from a district like tusd that has prohibited participation through local school district governing board policy
2918738 amazed at the number of student applications that are crossing my desk that indicate students returning from charter and private schools
2918739 we always receive students from outside the district each year but i have no sense of how many may have enrolled this year
2918740 i cant wait to see the numbers after the first day of school to assess whether through returning students and students from other districts we have made up for the number of students who have left the district in recent years
2918741 the decision was hard because we were very happy where we were

2918746 this is the place where people will be able to interact with animals before they adopt them
2918747 we are seeing an increase in dogs in our sector helping us get to situations faster and screen vehicles much quicker
2918748 theres wind distracting odors agents working around them other dogs and of course the 1 500 vehicles that drive by every hour
2918749 they do this so my dog hits the smell forcing us to pull the car over for a second inspection while the car with the load tries to sneak by a few cars behind
2918750 any little residue and my dog will alert me to it
2918751 we have no confirmation of how these cars are being contaminated but we are checking each car and when our dogs alert us we check the cars behind it too
2918752 i couldnt even try to explain how these dogs find that one concealed person in a van full of people but they do
2918753 thats the part of the job an agent couldnt do alone thats why we have these dogs working with us every day
2918754 the fitness level of these dogs doesnt compare to a house dog
2918755 these dogs are trained to work hard long hours almost every day

2918764 wenn es zum beispiel ins dach hineinregnet und das repariert werden muss m ssen alle daf r zahlen ohne dass daf r vorher eine abstimmung stattfinden muss
2918765 dann verl sst einer die erbengemeinschaft das geht aber meist gibt es auch hier uneinigkeit ber den zugrunde zu legenden wert der durch drei zu teilen ist

2918768 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2918769 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2918770 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2918771 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2918772 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2918773 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2918774 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2918775 the world is full of light and life and the true crime is not to be interested in it
2918776 this is stuff you see other people do and you think thatd be awesome

2918780 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
2918781 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
2918782 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
2918783 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
2918784 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
2918785 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
2918786 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
2918787 the world is full of light and life and the true crime is not to be interested in it
2918788 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
2918789 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
2918790 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
2918791 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
2918792 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
2918793 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2918794 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2918795 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
2918796 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2918797 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2918798 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2918799 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2918800 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2918801 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2918802 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2918803 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2918804 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2918805 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2918806 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2918807 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2918808 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
2918809 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
2918810 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
2918811 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
2918812 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
2918813 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2918814 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2918815 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2918816 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2918817 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2918818 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2918819 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2918820 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2918821 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2918822 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2918823 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud

2918837 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2918838 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2918839 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2918840 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2918841 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2918842 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

2918846 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2918847 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2918848 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2918849 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
2918850 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
2918851 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
2918852 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
2918853 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
2918854 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
2918855 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
2918856 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2918857 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2918858 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2918859 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2918860 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2918861 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2918862 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2918863 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2918864 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2918865 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2918866 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2918867 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2918868 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2918869 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2918870 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2918871 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2918872 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2918873 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2918874 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2918875 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2918876 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2918877 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2918878 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2918879 speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far
2918880 he had a strong belief that judges should not be in the public eye
2918881 the word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses the bible a collection of honourable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish no interpretation no matter how subtle can for me change this
2918882 like other great scientists he does not fit the boxes in which popular polemicists like to pigeonhole him
2918883 it is clear for example that he had respect for the religious values enshrined within judaic and christian traditions but what he understood by religion was something far more subtle than what is usually meant by the word in popular discussion
2918884 i believe in spinozas god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a god who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings
2918885 science without religion is lame religion without science is blind
2918886 necessarily derives from religion as most people understand the term
2918887 is a faith based belief there is plenty of evidence for that position based on centuries of scientific inquiry
2918888 i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly
2918889 he was quite wrong his continued use of words such as
2918890 non belief in what and why is that so important
2918891 i have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal god is a childlike one you may call me an agnostic but i do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination in youth i prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being
2918892 from the viewpoint of a jesuit priest i am of course and have always been an atheist your counter arguments seem to me very correct and could hardly be better formulated it is always misleading to use anthropomorphical concepts in dealing with things outside the human sphere childish analogies we have to admire in humility the beautiful harmony of the structure of the world as far was we can grasp it and that is all
2918893 i do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination in youth i prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being
2918894 the reasonable interpretation is that einstein got more atheistic as he got older
2918895 i prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being
2918896 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2918897 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2918898 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2918899 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2918900 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2918901 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2918902 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2918903 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2918904 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2918905 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2918906 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2918907 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2918908 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2918909 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2918910 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2918911 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2918912 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
2918913 thats second nature to me whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
2918914 is different than anything ive ever done that kind of has a pop quality to it
2918915 when i was a kid growing up in the southwest i worked for a rodeo company
2918916 so we wanted to do the comedy to tip our hats to the old burt reynolds movies and we wanted our characters to be strong and have the toast be a thread that runs through the movie
2918917 i was really concerned about hollywood meets ted nugent with their extreme difference in philosophies
2918918 teds a good friend of mine and teds not a hater yeah hes got a strong agenda and he carries a gun but hes never pulled it on anyone he can be dangerous if you try to tread on him but he doesnt bring the hate to the table hes so fun he kept everybody in stitches
2918919 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
2918920 al gore heard me say that and said were going to get some people on opposite ends of confrontation like rosie and donald trump and put em on the tv
2918921 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
2918922 you realize that you know what 50 million spins as a writer compares to lennon the bee gees and billy joel
2918923 ive got a 35 greatest hits album in the store right now
2918924 you can imagine how much it meant to people who needed that song whether people hated it or loved it it left its mark
2918925 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
2918926 most people who talk about courtesy of the red white and blue never even heard the song
2918927 if you read it word for word you know what it means lets go out and get the people responsible for 9 11 they attacked new york they attacked the pentagon they came and killed a bunch of innocent americans
2918928 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war
2918929 my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
2918930 his presidency will be better judged 40 years from now
2918931 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say
2918932 if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
2918933 i think obama stands the best chance for the democratic party since clinton mccain is a good solid choice a smarter version of what we have we probably need a change and the economy needs a change and come election day ill have my mind made up
2918934 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
2918935 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2918936 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2918937 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2918938 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2918939 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2918940 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2918941 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2918942 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2918943 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2918944 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2918945 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2918946 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2918947 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2918948 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2918949 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2918950 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2918951 just so you all know we did set a record
2918952 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2918953 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2918954 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2918955 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2918956 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2918957 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2918958 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2918959 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2918960 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2918961 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2918962 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2918963 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2918964 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2918965 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2918966 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2918967 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2918968 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2918969 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2918970 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2918971 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2918972 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2918973 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2918974 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2918975 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2918976 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2918977 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2918978 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2918979 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2918980 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2918981 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2918982 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2918983 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2918984 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2918985 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2918986 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2918987 the review process demonstrated there was broad support for a reduction in the number of teams in the air new zealand cup however the hard part of that decision is having to consider which teams would not be included in the competition
2918988 according to the norwalk conn research company wine consumption increased 4 while distilled spirits were up 3 2 and beer rose 1 2
2918989 craft beers also saw double digit growth while wine continued to find appeal with newer drinkers
2918990 i wish i could clean this baby up and stir some soup with it
2918991 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2918992 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2918993 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2918994 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2918995 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2918996 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2918997 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2918998 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2918999 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2919000 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2919001 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2919002 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2919003 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2919004 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2919005 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2919006 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2919007 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2919008 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2919009 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2919010 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2919011 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2919012 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2919013 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2919014 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2919015 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2919016 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2919017 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2919018 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2919019 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2919020 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2919021 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2919022 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2919023 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2919024 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2919025 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2919026 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2919027 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2919028 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2919029 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2919030 dia moreno sudah cukup tahu apa yang akan dia lakukan
2919031 seluruhnya ada enam gram kurang lebih tapi tidak bagian kepemilikan satu orang bersama sama
2919032 mungkin baru kali ini mengalami seperti ini ditahan di kantor polisi dengan dugaan kasus narkoba
2919033 di jakarta aku nggak akan macam macem nggak akan bandel
2919034 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2919035 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2919036 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
2919037 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
2919038 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
2919039 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
2919040 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
2919041 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
2919042 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
2919043 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
2919044 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
2919045 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
2919046 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
2919047 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2919048 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
2919049 as far as i know we dont publish response and refusal rates we conducted the poll for the associated press youd have to ask them about releasing the response and refusal rates
2919050 we dont have them here from ipsos it takes a little while for them to get those to us i can ask them it shouldnt take too long but normally it takes a few days theyre not secret or anything
2919051 can you please give us the response and refusal rates for your most recent national poll
2919052 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2919053 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
2919054 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing
2919055 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
2919056 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2919057 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2919058 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2919059 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2919060 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2919061 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2919062 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
2919063 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all
2919064 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2919065 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2919066 its personal with him in terms of his own legacy and the race stuff really left a bad taste in his mouth
2919067 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2919068 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2919069 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2919070 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2919071 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2919072 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2919073 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2919074 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2919075 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2919076 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2919077 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2919078 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2919079 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2919080 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2919081 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2919082 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2919083 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2919084 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2919085 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2919086 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2919087 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2919088 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2919089 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2919090 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2919091 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2919092 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2919093 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2919094 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2919095 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2919096 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2919097 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2919098 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2919099 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2919100 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2919101 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2919102 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2919103 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2919104 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2919105 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2919106 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2919107 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2919108 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2919109 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2919110 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2919111 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2919112 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2919113 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
2919114 what we all are witnessing is the attempt at a full scale military occupation like the one of 1921
2919115 we the georgian authorities will not allow this to happen we will not allow this to happen together with the people of georgia with the georgian population
2919116 today at a time of hardship for the country when its all about the existence of the georgian state as such i would like to pass the appeal of the georgian president of the entire georgian government over to you we have to unite
2919117 wherever the enemy army enters we have to confront it with all means at our disposal do not allow them occupy georgia again as in 1921 our strength is in our unity
2919118 it is an unwritten law that in this kind of situation you have to stop all inter party confrontations therefore in the name of the new rightist party i am declaring a moratorium on confrontation with the government and call upon all opposition parties all political forces to stop inter party conflicts
2919119 i never had a particularly high opinion of russias military might its quantity never turns into quality this military force has been defeated by countries whose size was similar to ours finland is a good example here and it is not the only one
2919120 it is our unity our union that makes us strong and we will be able to defeat them this is inevitable

2919125 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2919126 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2919127 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2919128 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2919129 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2919130 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2919131 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
2919132 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2919133 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2919134 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2919135 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2919136 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2919137 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2919138 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2919139 the average business traveler will spend three years in flight two years traveling to and from airports 28 months waiting for flights that are on time 11 months waiting for connections and more than three months just searching for a parking spot

2919178 i had prepared very well there was no problem with my technique i just did not catch the opportunity
2919179 i was very tired the qualification used up all my energy and i had no time to rest since there was not much gap before the final
2919180 it was much harder than at athens my craving for gold was much more than last time but i could not concentrate enough

2919199 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2919200 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2919201 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2919202 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2919203 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2919204 i spoke with kaka yesterday saturday we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet
2919205 i think an august transfer is still a possibility though kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal
2919206 he is waiting for a deal and then he will start to negotiate with chelsea
2919207 normally milan do not sell their best players we think they like the proposal but it is not so easy for them to accept it
2919208 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2919209 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2919210 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2919220 why then do creationists and id believers think they are entitled to exercise censorship in the science classroom and what are the potential consequences of this attitude we address these questions in what follows in the form of a few vignettes
2919221 the point is more about whether creationists are objective allies of those who promote particular societal and political trends in the united states trends that run the risk of swaying our country in an antiscientific theocratic direction for the long run this indeed seems to be the happening with the u s government of the early twenty first century
2919222 let us now assume for a minute that our country veers more toward christian fundamentalism and its mutual ally creationism combine this with the much longer screening process for issuing u s visas a result of the 9 11 catastrophe and the perception of the united states now being a belligerent nation trying to force its values on other nations what do you think will be the effect of this on international students and scientists they may no longer be too interested in coming over and might opt for europe canada or australia instead the negative consequences of this would be incalculable the united states might see its prominence in science wane away

2919237 it is unfortunate that the democrats and republicans are now building a 50 billion fence on the u s mexico border it has divided families and is severely straining our relationship with mexico the goal of socialist party usa and our presidential candidate brian moore is to build a stronger bond with ours neighbors to the south and a basic income guarantee will help to resolve many of the issues involving immigration
2919238 history is indeed little more than the register of the crimes follies and misfortunes of mankind
2919239 his entire presidential campaign was based on hypocrisy and deception indeed nearly every word out of the former trial lawyers mouth dripped with insincerity and faleshood edwards campaign has essentially been one big con he played the role of champion of the poor while raking in mammoth legal fees and spending on himself and his family like a pampered prince who can forget his 400 haircuts last year paid for by his campaign
2919240 he admitted he hadnt been fully honest when he denied reports in the national enquirer of the affair
2919241 captain renault couldnt have been more shocked about gambling in casablanca the good news is that edwards who once was even being considered as barack obamas vice presidential running mate may be at the end of his political career we can only hope
2919242 here now is a man who went happily philandering as he was about to start a run for the white house and who gave his sexual partner a job and paid her out of his campaign funds reportedly 114 000 and then had the gall to ask democrats to to vote for him on the false pretense that he was an honest man and despite the fact that his candidacy was doomed so now edwards has been reduced to denying that he fathered his partners child and declaring that he is willing to be tested to prove his lack of paternity americans large of heart forgive many offenders flat out liars not so much

2919252 it was a 10 hopper through the infield its almost like our guys froze no way did i think that was going to win the game
2919253 we thought cano had a chance to dive for it
2919254 we were shocked we didnt know the game was over half our guys were wondering what happened
2919255 i was counting the hops all the way down to first base
2919256 it would be awesome to win 20 games but look at today
2919257 i feel the same way with a no decision when the team wins in the back of my mind i still got the win
2919258 hes one of the easiest guys ive ever known to get along with
2919259 he likes to interact with the entire world he has the door open to everyone
2919260 everybody around him is always laughing time goes by quickly when youre around him
2919261 its always nice when someone from your country joins you you feel freer
2919262 you can speak more spanish be a little more social
2919263 i turned around took my eye off the ball and went into a dead sprint figuring id pick up the ball later i caught up to it and it fell into my glove a little luck was involved
2919264 i rolled it a bit but i woke up sunday and it was fine
2919265 he told me my swing looks good im just swinging at bad pitches
2919266 i made a point of swinging at strikes working counts i might not get a hit i might strike out but i have a chance
2919267 that spread makes it very clear that hes doing a good job
2919268 hes a terrific technician he has sound fundamentals hes very athletic has good hands he puts visuals in right spots hes in tune with the pitchers the biggest thing is in game adjustments hes gotten a much better feel for that part of it
2919269 were just going to have to reach down and reach back as were playing two good teams coming in this week and its another test for us
2919270 im not going to make all the plays but i have to make that play plain and simple
2919271 i like what im seeing nobody is hanging their head
2919272 there are times youd like to lash out and say something but at the same time you have to step back and look at the situation first
2919273 thats more of an emotional or rash decision to go out and say something
2919274 you have to figure out why certain things are happening and look at the plus side of it this is a situation where theres definitely a big plus im getting the chance to play with one of the best players in the game and im getting to learn and see how he prepares himself
2919275 you have to know your place and know your role
2919276 im in a place and role in my career where i cant make a fuss about it i still have a lot to prove in this game
2919277 it was primarily battling trying to get by with what i had that day
2919278 my off speed stuff was there so i was pitching backwards
2919279 it wasnt his best outing as far as command and stuff but i see a lot of maturity there as far as finding a way to make it work
2919280 were starting to put ourselves in a bad situation and we just have to figure out a way to win
2919281 i thought we had a pickoff play going with richie and there was a serious miscommunication there he was actually talking to alex and alex was probably standing right behind me at third base it screwed up the inning big time
2919282 you know ive gone to a couple of ozzfests i think its been awesome i mean its such a great institution and its done so much for metal in america ozzy and sharon gave us our first big break in america in 1986 i will always respect that theyve been great to us so its cool im psyched should be good fun
2919283 i feel so connected to this guy i know hes interested and yet he keeps turning away am i crazy
2919284 alert alert alert one of them fuckers didnt have any shoes
2919285 i dont even know why i bother talking i dont even understand what comes out of my mouth

2919310 van deze jongedame mogen we binnen 2 3 jaar heel veel verwachten
2919311 ik vond haar supergoed ze stond daar met een slechte gitaar die misschien 100 of 150 euro had gekost ze deed zo enorm haar best bovendien heeft ze een heel soulvolle stem en bracht ze een prachtige cover van black star ze was n van de eerste artiesten en eigenlijk stond er niet veel volk maar iedereen die voorbijkwam hield halt en bedankte haar met jetons in de gitaarkist joni sheila is heel jong maar ze heeft de juiste instelling om het te maken ze zong zich de longen uit het lijf en dat is belangrijker een straatzanger mag geen remmingen hebben hij of zij moet zich helemaal smijten en dat moet je kunnen op zo jonge leeftijd voor mij is zij de ideale stella music busker

2919315 a story tells of two friends who were walking through desert during some point of the journey they had an argument and one friend slapped the other one in the face the one who got slapped was hurt but without saying anything wrote in the sand today my best friend slapped me in the face they kept on walking until they found an oasis where they decided to take a bath the one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning but the friend saved him after he recovered from the near drowning he wrote on a stone today my best friend saved my life the friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him after i hurt you you wrote in the sand and now you write on a stone why the other friend replied when someone hurts us we should write it down in sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away but when someone does something good for us we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it learn to write your hurts in the sand and to carve your blessings in stone they say it takes a minute to find a special person an hour to appreciate them a day to love them but then an entire life to forget them

2919343 ellos nunca podr n encontrar su alma gemela en alguien de su mismo sexo y s lo tendr n que contentarse con relaciones del alma no hay almas gemelas del mismo sexo
2919344 all this started from zero its not an organised campaign and we have no funds to speak of this is really a peoples protest because its from the people themselves which makes it all the more special
2919345 it could be a language problem internet access or the circles of social network are not big enough
2919346 i think one of the reasons why not a lot of asians seem to be paying attention to this campaign is because china is a big brother of sorts in this region
2919347 i hope people will watch our daily broadcasts to hear from the people of darfur who have suffered for so long
2919348 we are not against the people of china and the olympics some of us even have compassion for the leaders of china
2919349 there are a lot of people in the free world who are afraid of china a lot of companies are afraid of china they put profit first before values and its absurd
2919350 but we are not afraid and this is just the beginning
2919351 i know after he got out of the service he never put in a full nights sleep because he was always waiting for that crash to happen
2919352 the bills were blowing around in the wind and us kids were running around picking them up as fast as we could
2919353 everyone was out of their homes in the streets rejoicing i guess
2919354 we grew up watching john wayne movies on saturday mornings the second world war was very much fresh in our minds
2919355 we wanted to go down to the burnout pit but the smell was overwhelming
2919356 its great that theyre doing stuff like this in putnam it really wakes the town up

2919359 were trying to have the first tenants by the end of august
2919360 weve been working here since february 2007 and things are moving steadily
2919361 it had been an office building for a number of years when it was bought by a local investment group
2919362 then it sat empty for years and years and years mr tse came along with his group and decided to renovate it it accomplishes a number of things it protects a historic building downtown it provides housing and it puts feet on the street
2919363 from a marketing aspect mr tse has told me he has no problems that he has a number of units spoken for already
2919364 sometimes all it takes is for someone to invest in a downtown and others will follow norwich already has some nice shops restaurants galleries and the arts
2919365 there is a demand in eastern connecticut for all forms of rentals from homeless and government subsidized to luxury units
2919366 most local zoning laws discourage the construction for multiple family dwellings theres always a shortage of rental units whether youre talking about two three or four units or apartment buildings
2919367 what we want to do is create a regional arts council
2919368 the putnam arts council their mission is to operate and bring the needs of putnam into focus
2919369 the cultural assessment will be the road map as to what happens
2919370 right now were all just kind of learning the language of an arts council and finding out the cultural issues
2919371 those people will come together and decide and figure out what kind of cultural life we want to support the arts council
2919372 theres a lot of great artists around here i dont think theres enough advertising or information gotten out for people to know about it
2919373 some of the asbestos is in floor tiles and more is around things like pipes
2919374 a good thing is when you do things like that before the major construction a lot of times you can get a better idea of things you need to do and avoid some surprises
2919375 and if youve ever been a parent driving over there to pick up a child at dismissal time you will get stuck in traffic

2919413 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind
2919414 he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator he was a creative genius i shall never forget how in the height of his career he still had time to work and lend his celebrity to those of us much younger and at that time who were totally unknown even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2919415 first condolences to ike dirty his son and his entire family
2919416 thank god we were blessed with his music and his incredible work he truly made soul music bare to the bone im a better artist because of my mama playing his music

2919423 ive heard starbucks has a history of firing union activists but i didnt expect to be fired just for discussing things with co workers
2919424 many stores are meeting their sales target but starbucks is still shutting them down it comes down to cannibalization starbucks stores are competing with other starbucks on the same intersection so they figure if they close one the other store across the street will see increased traffic but guess what the longer lines and more work wont mean more money for the baristas
2919425 but in cities with a large union presence like new york baristas have pressured starbucks to give them a 2 dollar wage increase
2919426 i know someone who was one hour short of the minimum and didnt receive health coverage
2919427 until the economy significantly improves were just trying to do what we can to get through this storm
2919428 not one person in my neighbourhood has a building permit
2919429 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
2919430 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
2919431 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
2919432 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
2919433 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
2919434 most demolitions are of multi storey buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
2919435 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
2919436 it was an eye opener to realise that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable
2919437 imagine your children leaving in the morning for school and returning later in the day to find their home their whole world has disappeared while they were gone

2919443 sex workers routinely face human rights abuses including the discriminatory denial of health services arbitrary detention by police harassment and sexual and physical violence
2919444 this award recognizes the extraordinary contribution of the asia pacific network of sex workers in the struggle for sex workers rights
2919445 i am honored to accept this award on behalf of the asia pacific network of sex workers
2919446 international recognition of sex workers human rights is vital to curb the hiv pandemic governments and un agencies need to promote sustainable comprehensive hiv prevention and care initiatives for sex workers that are community led and protect their human rights
2919447 being a part of apnsw working in solidarity with tens of thousands of sex workers in the region has allowed us to challenge the way the authorities have applied this law in cambodia and to gain strength to bring this issue to international attention
2919448 the international aids conference presents a forum to focus worldwide attention on the epidemic and our global response
2919449 unfortunately too often that response has been tainted by prejudice and misinformation only by ensuring the health and human rights of sex workers will governments un agencies donors and nongovernmental groups be effective at reducing the vulnerability of sex workers to hiv infection the asia pacific networks work epitomizes this

2919500 it feels to me like a real song of the moment here and now in the summer of 2008 its a bit controversial and makes people think
2919501 its always a bit of a shock to hear that you have a no 1 record but i always felt that the blend of the song and the artist was so strong that we stood a good chance of having a hit

2919506 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2919507 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2919508 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2919509 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2919510 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family

2919525 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2919526 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2919527 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2919528 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2919529 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2919535 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
2919536 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
2919537 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement

2919542 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2919543 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2919544 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation
2919545 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honoured to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2919546 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2919547 it may have stemmed from some kind of domestic dispute

2919553 the gravest danger is that the national economy will weaken further and spiral downward into a negative cycle that feeds on itself as conditions darken people hunker down and wait for the storm to pass consumers stop buying banks stop lending producing companies cut their workforces that feeds more defaulted loan losses back into the banking systems balance sheets this vicious cycle is essentially what led to the great depression after the stock market crash of 1929 i offer not a prediction but a warning the comparison may sound farfetched now but us policy makers and politicians are putting us at risk of historic deflationary forces that once they take hold are very difficult to reverse

2919556 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
2919557 for me a major strength of the app store is that it has a wide range of applications at a range of price points and from a range of developers i think thats what attracts so many people to it
2919558 es ist ein sehr ausgewogenes polizeigesetz mit einer moderaten anpassung an die sicherheitslage im bezug auf islamistischen terrorismus und schwerkriminalit t dabei steht aber auch der verbesserte schutz der bev lkerung im vordergrund
2919559 the experience of the sharks really helped they did well but i am proud of the youngsters in my team they showed their worth im happy our guys worked hard showed commitment
2919560 it was good to come back to the sharks but it was a great team performance with three brilliant loosies you can rely on them to steal ball and they carried the ball well
2919561 fred played very well tonight and gave us some good go forward ball with his tactical kicking
2919562 credit to my guys they were outstanding last week and this week again was a great result for us
2919563 we have some world class players and to have them back created real pressure for province they are fantastic players but credit to all the guys i thought the forwards and loosies were outstanding at the breakdowns
2919564 you can see in the change rooms the guys are happy not because they are winning but because of the way we are playing and the whole team is contributing
2919565 i think i was reasonable around the park apart from giving away too many penalties
2919566 and you cant get away with that at test level
2919567 i have had a good review of those and a couple i thought might have been a bit harsh a couple were just silly penalties i cant afford to be giving away
2919568 i have had a good review of that and talked them through
2919569 it is something i have patched up in my game and something i will be working on in the future
2919570 it is about being clinical at that level and decisions are very important
2919571 it is just about making the correct decision under pressure and at the right time it is something that i have addressed and i am looking to work on
2919572 there was no secret that there was a lot of pressure on us to perform having two losses there was a lot of talk in the media about the way this all black team has gone
2919573 we really felt that we had to put a performance out there and definitely take the win against the wallabies who are going well
2919574 it is obvious that as world champions our biggest strengths are in the line out and in the scrum
2919575 and it is precisely here where the opposition will try and neutralize us the all blacks use tactics which are illegal and as far as i know if it is illegal then it is not allowed
2919576 we have picked up three things that they do which are illegal in the line outs
2919577 it starts with their flanker coming through the line out illegally to stop any ball thrown down to the half back
2919578 all i know is that if there is a rule and if it applies to one team it applies to both teams the referee has to blow according to the rules and not according to his interpretation its that simple
2919579 if i looked at reserve half back and i have to choose between ruan pienaar and fourie du preez and i sent fourie back i would have to have my head read
2919580 the same goes in a decision between jaque fourie and frans steyn i told ruan and frans it is great to have you here but if fourie or jaque are back then you are at the back of the queue again
2919581 i told them you can go back and decide where you want to play
2919582 ruan is a very good player but as a half back i have to ask if he does all the basic things that a half back has to do
2919583 for me personally i dropped a few balls in sydney
2919584 i guess that resulted in a few errors as a whole team i probably had to lift my game in auckland and just do it for the team and the coaches
2919585 i was pretty stoked i didnt make a mistake or drop a ball because you get teased about it when you get home
2919586 i guess i didnt really look after the ball in sydney
2919587 one time i got it from andy ellis and luke burgess tackled me and i knocked it on the other time i thought about trying off load before i tried to get through the contact
2919588 i tried to off load to daniel braidy and knocked it on
2919589 it is just probably doing one job at a time instead of trying to think about doing a break or making a gap for someone it is just the first job really
2919590 it is pretty hard when everyone says i should be kicking i guess the coaches game plan is just letting dc dan carter kick
2919591 i am working on it but at this stage it is just really practicing personally i have to apply it to the game it is like anything else in your game when you try and bring a lot of strings to your game
2919592 you just have to do it in your game it is easy enough to do it in your game
2919593 ironically we have probably got the best man in the world there daniel carter but in general we havent played a huge kicking game
2919594 we have known for some years that we havent been the best at kick receive under pressure so have done a hell of a lot of work
2919595 mick byrne who i think is the best in the world as a kicking coach and catching coach he is getting around the country and doing a lot of work with the air new zealand cup teams and with the super 14
2919596 it is a process that is working with our players at the elite level but it is also making sure that the ones coming through are going to be able to play this game
2919597 tuqiri is very good cross looks like he is very good under the high ball
2919598 it is something that we have to come up to the mark with it hasnt been a big part of our game in the country
2919599 i would say 80 per cent of league tries come either directly or indirectly off kicks
2919600 and i think it is going to become more prevalent in rugby
2919601 if you look at australia what is their number one sport afl
2919602 and that is all about aerial catching and nrl rugby league skills have come from arl
2919603 it is something that they do in their own background as kids it is a natural skill they develop over time
2919604 it seems like it is coming along quite well but it also felt like that the week before the second all blacks game which i missed
2919605 it will be interesting to see what the doctor has to say
2919606 we have got two games over there so i would be surprised if i wasnt fit for the second game at least
2919607 it feels reasonably good but its hard to say because i havent walked without the boot yet
2919608 you dont always get picked for the next game let alone down the track so you dont want to miss whatever opportunities you get
2919609 you cant walk around with your head around your ankles i dont think one loss is going to worry the boys too much theyll move on pretty quickly
2919610 you can play particular types of games or have a lot of travel and you may tire if your recovery isnt on the mark
2919611 but having played argentina at not full strength i am not sure thats going to have any effect on the tri nations
2919612 thats the big thing over there handling the pressure there are big crowds who love the springboks and the side feeds off it the pressure can build up
2919613 weil sie so gl nzen da auf den zehenn geln

2919628 the economic policies pursued by president musharraf during the past eight years have brought pakistan to the brink of critical economic impasse
2919629 his policies have weakened the federation and eroded the trust of the nation in national institutions
2919630 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2919631 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2919632 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2919633 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2919634 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2919635 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2919636 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2919637 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2919638 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2919639 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2919640 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
2919641 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
2919642 whatever seems neither to acknowledge nor to compromise with us is wild once i embraced that way of looking at things i found wild places waiting round almost every corner

2919652 it was a very disappointing way to lose the community shield
2919653 we hadnt particularly practised penalties and united were very positive with theirs
2919654 some of our players needed the game especially those like lassana diarra and niko kranjkar whove been away on international commitments this summer
2919655 we need some width to our attack but we hope that will come and well learn to improve the quality of service we give the front two

2919669 there were underage voters in most of the schools they just told their names to the board of election inspectors without bothering to show any identification and were allowed to vote i havent seen one id card shown but the comelec allows them to vote this allows impersonation and phantom votes
2919670 i dont think its smooth its smooth in terms of less violence but in terms of free and fair i dont think so i would like to observe more precincts
2919671 that is unfortunate in times past there were people who were there to register and our people declined to register them because they were only 15 years old but the father will say thats my son hes 21 they try to intimidate the beis to register them melo told anc
2919672 we hope to cleanse the voters lists when the time comes
2919673 these comprise about 1 896 voters in the sumisip villages and 789 votes in the akbar villages if the numbers are crucial we will declare a special election
2919674 i just talked to the provincial directors of lanao del sur maguindanao tawi tawi basilan and sulu there were no untoward incidents except the strafing attack in basilan
2919675 it is more orderly considering that armm has been called the cheating capital of the country
2919676 there is no official directive to oppose the holding of the elections
2919677 while we are protesting the elections we only asked for their postponement
2919678 we never looked at an agenda of term extension that is not the ultimate objective
2919679 in a cross section of countries government regulation is strongly negatively correlated with social capital we document and try to explain this highly significant empirical correlation the correlation works for a range of measures of social capital from trust in others to trust in corporations and political institutions as well as for a range of measures of regulation from product markets to labor markets to judicial procedures we present a simple model explaining this correlation the model turns on the idea that investment in social capital makes people both more productive and more civic e g coleman 1990 compared to people who have invested in social capital those who have not are both less productive and impose a negative externality on others when they produce e g pollute the community whether through voting or through some other political mechanism regulates production when the expected negative externalities are large but regulation itself must be implemented by government officials who are corrupt if they have not invested in social capital as a consequence when production is restricted through regulation investment in social capital may not pay off in this model when people expect to live in a civil community they expect low levels of regulation and so invest in social capital their beliefs are justified and investment leads to civility low regulation and high output when in contrast people expect to live in an uncivil community they do not invest in social capital and remain uncivil and unproductive their beliefs again are justified as lack of investment leads to incivility high regulation high corruption and low production
2919680 its not time to protect somebody thats polluting groundwater at a time that we have to rely increasingly more on groundwater as part of a comprehensive solution
2919681 once a community does something like a ban on softeners theyre going to end up with a lot of consumers who rely on water softening to protect their property who are going to be caught completely by surprise
2919682 you can either pay a lot of money for new improvements very expensive treatment plant improvements or you can try to do something at the source
2919683 although the chinese have been capable of disrupting groups operating inside the country these new attackers are trained and equipped outside and come into china to carry out operations this is a new capability that chinese security forces have to deal with and they are finding it difficult
2919684 that means that little by little theyre not going to do their work
2919685 i am not against immigration i am against illegal immigration
2919686 pretty much the same way you got this one id guess
2919687 well not unless there was more to shangri la than advertised lin doesnt think so but then again she didnt think id been dosed with enough of the magic water to do more than heal me either
2919688 but it was pretty obvious something had happened when she started aging again and i didnt
2919689 youll like her she looks about eighty now this tiny little chinese woman but shes been around since something or other bc and she can still kick my ass when she wants to
2919690 no more like a hundred and fifteen itll be a hundred sixteen this december
2919691 id never have guessed it when i met you but it was kind of hard not to notice your friends changing without you when i looked through your photos
2919692 right anyway shes going to be in town tomorrow lin we have dinner every year on the anniversary of alexs death
2919693 shes the only family i really have left her and alexs kids are all grown and scattered evies brother died years ago and my own family dumped me in an orphanage in cairo when i was a kid lins the only one left who really remembers
2919694 three times really but just the one time that stuck
2919695 no ones ever guessed that right off the bat before
2919696 she was killed on one of our adventures stabbed in the gut by an old enemy took her a couple minutes to die and i well its a long story but the book of the dead was involved alex got his hands on it while i went charging off to avenge her he and jonathan evies brother brought her back just in time to stop me from getting myself killed too and that was one of the first things she said afterward did i want to know what heaven looked like
2919697 i was there a lot longer about five months according to but it felt like forever to me i didnt notice much of anything for about a year after that the adjustment nearly killed me all over again so i cant be sure the urn of osiris is really what made the difference but since willow raised me with it well i dont injure much when i do i heal really quickly and the aging thing yeah id been hoping it didnt mean what you think it means but it probably does
2919698 i think thats one of the first things i noticed about you you fight like an angel like youve been doing it for a million years but you still have spirit i could see it in your eyes thats what drew me to evie too she started out as just a librarian couldnt even throw a punch when i met her but she had that fire in her she never let anything stop her from trying to do the right thing
2919699 i got myself nearly killed and it was like it threw her into another gear no more trying to retire for her she wanted to wring every last ounce of excitement we could get out of life she died in action a few years later just after our first granddaughter was born
2919700 this isnt just a temporary fling for you is it
2919701 i admit its not something i was looking for i pretty much never thought id find a partner ever again but you know i wasnt really looking for it with evelyn either it just happened she saved my life the day i met her then endangered it in wild and unusual ways and by the time our first adventure was over i knew our life together would never be boring
2919702 yes to the question or to me needing to ask
2919703 shes been worried thered be no one left to look after me when shes gone
2919704 did you win two titles in a year ed well did you
2919705 asked how close he is to 100 percent he said im right there
2919706 i can finally let my grandkids outside to play in this new playground when they come to visit me in sderot
2919707 usually i have to keep them pent up inside the house its nice to have a playground like this where the children can play somewhat at peace but its obviously not a solution to living with the rocket fire
2919708 i just want the rockets to stop for good so that we dont have to live for these little moments of quiet that are followed by terrible barrages of qassams
2919709 the cease fire is giving families especially parents and kids a chance to breathe a little
2919710 this is not a real calm however because we know the rocket fire will resume soon
2919711 most people anticipate another heavy round of rocket fire based on what happened in the last cease fire
2919712 just governments must sometimes take the lives of unrepentant terrorist mass murderers in order to protect and uphold the infinite value of human life
2919713 oh its going to be so hard to say goodbye i love you all too
2919714 toto were home home and this is my room and youre all here and im never leaving here ever ever again because i love you all

2919720 the time has come for my children to be freed
2919721 rouse the moshiach from his heavenly berth have him get in his chariot and head down to earth
2919722 i am the moshiach hashem has heard your plea your geulah has come its time to go free
2919723 just look at his hat at the pinches and brim
2919724 whoever heard of moshiach with a brim thats turned down
2919725 if this is the rule ill turn my brim up before i go to the next shul
2919726 if you want to be moshiach you must be properly outfitted
2919727 no difference to me what i wear on my head
2919728 youre the moshiach just imagine that whoever heard of moshiach without a black hat
2919729 if you want to be moshiach and be accepted in this town put some pinches in your hat and turn that brim down
2919730 i guess my time hasnt come ill just have to return to where i came from
2919731 yes its very wonderful that you all learn torah but you seem to have forgotten a crucial part of our mesorah
2919732 the first place to start is to shut up your mouths and open up your hearts
2919733 to each of you certain yidden seem too frum or too frei but all yidden are beloved in the aibishters eye

2919739 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her
2919740 she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2919741 were working on him they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2919742 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
2919743 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2919744 shes devastated however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
2919745 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2919746 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2919747 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2919748 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2919749 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2919750 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2919751 when i showed up to work he said something to me that had never been said to me on a set before he said baby girl the script here is not the bible do you and ill follow i got mine you get yours when he said that i knew everything was going to be all right i was happy to have the freedom to make up some funny with him it was simply delicious my working experiences with bernie were so amazing that from that point on i wouldnt have cared if he called me in the middle of the night to come and be in a scene where i didnt have anything to do but sit in the background and eat cereal i wouldve just done it because i loved him like that
2919752 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
2919753 he was one of those comics that was unique because of his approach his look his voice and the content of his material bernie fell into that category of people who were inherently different like when you saw them you knew they were different and when they spoke you knew they were different as comics were all brothers and ill miss him a lot he was a good friend of mine
2919754 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy
2919755 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2919756 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man
2919757 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place he was a tremendous live performer and a wonderful actor fox was proud to be the home of the bernie mac show and all of us at fox and 20th century fox television extend our deepest sympathies to his wife rhonda and daughter jeniece
2919758 he was a genuinely funny and nice guy i say this because prior to working with him on the show i had no knowledge of who he was and how well known of a comedian he was but unlike a lot of people at his level he was very friendly down to earth and accommodating when our paths accidentally crossed about a week later at lax airport he greeted me as if i had been a life long friend and i could feel the genuine warmth and sincerity of that greeting may god have mercy on his soul
2919759 bernie mac had the ability to effortlessly make people laugh he was an incredible talent with whom my colleagues and i in aafca always looked forward to covering bernie had a big heart and he will certainly be missed by the members of our organization
2919760 while her condition has improved she still has some problems

2919764 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
2919765 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator he was a creative genius i shall never forget how in the height of his career he still had time to work and lend his celebrity to those of us much younger and at that time who were totally unknown even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2919766 ive lost one of my best buddies and it is not easy to reckon with
2919767 i know one can never put a question mark where god puts a period so i will not question the almightys decision to call him home we all know when that call comes we all will answer personally my buddy will be missed for many reasons by me he was family he will be a part of my musical life each time i sing the song deja vu as this was a birthday gift to me from him his renditions of songs that i had recorded especially walk on by in my opinion the definitive version will always be another memory each time i sing it and the humorous side that he showed few that i knew so well my family and i send sincere heart felt condolences to his family for their enormous loss and we will hold them in continuous prayer
2919768 the loss of isaac hayes less than 24 hours after bernie mac represents a major double blow to the entire entertainment industry black hollywood in particular the art form and expressions created by isaac hayes in particular resonated not only in american pop culture but throughout american life both are talents that will be missed but always remembered
2919769 three time grammy winner isaac hayes was a true renaissance man singer songwriter producer session musician actor activist and more after laying the groundwork for the memphis soul sound through his work with stax records his groundbreaking theme song and score for the movie shaft cemented his status as a musical icon he was actively involved with our memphis chapter sharing his creativity with established professionals and up and coming musicians alike the world has lost a true creative genius and a passionate humanitarian but his indelible legacy will remain ever present our deepest sympathies go out to his family friends and all who were inspired by the man and his music

2919785 i heard the first initial boom and thought perhaps there had been a gas explosion at a neighbhours home
2919786 i realized as soon as i turned the corner this was no house fire but the propane company
2919787 and the whole place just lit up i couldnt believe how huge the fireball was over my head i quickly threw my car into reverse to get home but the force of the blast actually pulled my car backwards
2919788 by that time the lights had gone out and we were all scrambling in the dark grabbing shoes flashlights and whatever we could get our hands on
2919789 my mother has early alzheimers and you can imagine the shock and bewilderment the two are in
2919790 if there was going to be another duet with dad i felt it should be something more whimsical fun and light
2919791 at the same time i was looking for a song that would also be familiar to a certain type of audience i think this is going to work just as well its adorable and loving between parent and child it feels like hes right there with me how do you top that

2919795 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her
2919796 she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2919797 were working on him they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2919798 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
2919799 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
