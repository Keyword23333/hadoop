5160000 i wouldnt come back from that kind of surgery right now id fix the tendon and leave the ligament alone
5160001 honestly i hope i can get a goal every game
5160002 im getting my legs back so thats a key and i have confidence now that i can get goals in back to back games im getting my second chance and im making the most of it
5160003 i was surprised that i was able to get there to the ball
5160004 i thought someone would cut me off before i got there i just took off
5160005 ive spoken to him a couple of times and expressed my feelings about him being a scorer
5160006 i knew that when hes 100 per cent healthy he can score hes getting fitter and stronger and hopefully it can continue
5160007 disappointment would be not making it to the final not making it out of the heats thats just ridiculous
5160008 i couldnt really get out of my bed until two days ago
5160009 i thought i was over it but it seems like it still has taken a lot out of my body
5160010 i got to one slow constant speed couldnt pick it up from there
5160011 in our relationship with the north there always exists the possibility of localized conflict so we cannot afford to loosen our readiness
5160012 to start a new war on the peninsula and stifle the north with force
5160013 it is quite nonsensical for the u s to offer a handshake to its dialogue partner while holding a dagger in its other hand
5160014 many installers do not have laptops with them on the job site
5160015 in order to expedite some smaller projects they often utilize remotes that program standalone meaning they dont require a pc but installers often get frustrated trying to program macros on them the mx 450 enables installers to program and more importantly edit macros right on its beautiful screen its the best of all worlds for an entry level or secondary room home theater installation
5160016 because of gps cell phones and mp3 players consumers now expect vibrant color screens on all handheld electronics
5160017 our professional remotes are following suit giving our dealers yet another attractive selling point
5160018 oh ernie come out come out where ever you are
5160019 i hate the song it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting
5160020 katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are

5160026 family members are not informed yet by the authorities where they are being detained what charges they are facing and whether they are alive or not
5160027 liu xiang has two injuries one in his foot and one in his leg
5160028 the rebels also shot a power transmission facility that caused a brownout
5160029 we are now taking military action to stop these atrocities
5160030 they have taken over the business center the rural banks pawnshops
5160031 twelve houses and a rural transit passenger bus were torched on saturday night the public market in kolambugan has been ransacked
5160032 this is a problem that has to be dealt with whether or not there is a peace process
5160033 what kind of public transportation would you like to see in richmond
5160034 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5160035 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5160036 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5160037 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5160038 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5160039 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5160040 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5160041 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5160042 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5160043 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5160044 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5160045 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5160046 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5160047 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5160048 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5160049 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5160050 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5160051 good position to work with and others on the problem
5160052 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5160053 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5160054 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5160055 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5160056 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5160057 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5160058 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5160059 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5160060 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5160061 todo gran proyecto necesita transformarse para trascender y hoy nosotros estamos iniciando ese proceso

5160064 one of my favorite people of all time is ms
5160065 so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge
5160066 some of these things come back right away and theyre ready to go a lot of players play with these things
5160067 it was just a man to man coverage and jon put it in a perfect spot
5160068 there was a little contact jons putting it in the right places and were running our routes in the right places
5160069 if we keep getting protection like that we can do whatever we want weve passed the ball well the last two years and knew we were going to be able to throw the football but weve got to keep working on the running game to help our defense
5160070 our quarterback was touched a little bit more than were used to
5160071 we were a little bit out of sync in the passing game early
5160072 its nice to be able to redeem yourself in a seven day period
5160073 its funny hawley comes up to me before the final and says jack i want you to completely get out of your mind what happened last weekend dont even think about that i said frank we dont teach mind games at the school were not supposed to be doing that
5160074 imagine being a little league player and you get to pitch against mickey mantle frank hawley has been all of that to the sport to have him come back in adds a whole other dimension to this and hell no i wasnt going to cut him any slack
5160075 like the last thing we needed was another tough funny car i was so happy for him when he won his rounds and he was happy for me all the way up to the final round so that was cool it was just a fairy tale weekend it really was
5160076 the valvoline mts dodge guys gave me such a great consistent race car
5160077 a couple of times it wanted to move over toward the centerline but it was a pretty smooth car all weekend long didn t throw us any curve balls out there
5160078 crew chief johnny west is a very conservative by nature type of guy so he and assistant crew chief tommy delago balance each other well and i think now that weve been consistent for a few races were starting to get quick and i think if we can take that to cold weather tracks we will be contending for the championship
5160079 theres a lot of mixed emotions the valvoline mts dodge has been running really good its like austin coil john forces crew chief told me a long time ago everybody tells you youve done a real good job when you win weve been doing the same job we just finally had good results the biggest part is the entire schumacher group and all the people at the shop and the guys who build the chassis thats the nucleus of the whole operation i just came in and brought a little continuity and thats what probably helped make this thing turn the corner outside of that i really havent done anything different than what ive normally done my whole life
5160080 it feels really good we know what it feels like to win early on in the year and we know what it feels like to struggle quite a bit and have a little bit of a slump since johnny west has come on board and started working with ed ace mcculloch napa crew chief and theyve been working together it seems like things are making a turn for the better
5160081 for both tony and jack to come out on top and the teams do what theyre supposed to do was terrific what a bunch of fantastic people im fortunate enough to have and to have sponsors like the u s army valvoline and mail terminal services on board and matco tools and all our other great sponsors its a great weekend
5160082 i think it was pretty obvious weve got a lot of work to do based on tonight in all three phases of the game
5160083 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5160084 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5160085 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5160086 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play
5160087 ich bin sehr zufrieden da es immer schwer ist im pokal ausw rts gegen einen gegner mit ehemaligen teamspielern zu spielen

5160119 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5160120 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5160121 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5160122 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5160123 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5160124 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5160125 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5160144 my timetable has been thrown into disarray by the georgian crisis
5160145 i always see my friend the dalai lama when he is in france
5160146 once again i was pleased with the unselfishness of our basketball team
5160147 were playing like and experienced group who has played a lot of basketball together our willingness to distribute the basketball and make the extra pass continues to be one of the great strengths of our team
5160148 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5160149 in 5 years youll still be 5 years older you can be 5 years older either with or without a college degree
5160150 anyone hankering for a book that is pure front to back action is likely to peg this as
5160151 in addition to our rigorous classroom teaching methods we are embarking on a major distance learning project
5160152 apart from regular students we at iit delhi want to help as many industry professionals as possible through the distant learning mode
5160153 this is a pilot project and once it delivers results it will provide a major boost for industry professionals we may soon have a full fledged set up for this distant education mode
5160154 we are trying to boost the infrastructure for this project we want some land and are in talks with the delhi government though nothing has been finalised as yet we would prefer to have land near our campus
5160155 we would make the 450 courses available on the distant mode our work scope in this field will be restricted to the national capital region
5160156 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good
5160157 lets not sow discord for future generations i dont appeal to your mercy but i appeal to your pragmatism and simple common sense i think the time to make the right decisions has come

5160159 i just wanted to qualify i tried to keep the race clean and keep everything in control and that is what i did
5160160 the time was nothing great but it was about qualification before i start to pick it up
5160161 i have raced against robles a few times and you know he is always going to be quick but i didnt notice him in the race i was just trying to take care of my own business and i am happy to qualify
5160162 it is a brilliant atmosphere and a fast track but its not a fast track if you hit a hurdle so i was just trying to keep it clean
5160163 liu xiang has two injuries one in his foot and one in his leg
5160164 one of the injuries is an accumulated injury in the past he has not dropped out of any competition easily
5160165 his right heel injury has been a problem since six years ago even before the athens olympics
5160166 on august 16 we arrived at the olympic village medical experts analyzed lius injury and specified there was a problem on lius achilless tendon
5160167 since athens his main goal was to achieve gold in beijing
5160168 todays result was not perfect for all of us and especially liu xiang he has been under great pressure and expectations from all of us
5160169 the time was nothing great but it was about qualification before i start to pick it up
5160170 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
5160171 the unvarnished truth is that what we most frequently give thanks for betrays what we most highly value
5160172 the pardoned soul is out of the gunshot of hell

5160175 for me federer is still technically the best he is the best player in the history of tennis
5160176 if federer can improve i can too for sure i can improve the serve 100 percent i can improve my volley im happy but its important to be humble if you want to continue improving
5160177 i have very good people around me so nothing will change
5160178 i was happy at number two im happy to be number one
5160179 due to frequent tides we can beach the ship just two hundred yards metres from the coast
5160180 it saves us thousands of dollars for every ship we break whereas in alang and china they beach ships two or three kilometres out into the sea
5160181 were handling ships as big as 80 000 tonnes these days
5160182 the rods made from scrap ships are inferior to those made by top steel producers but theyre at least 20 percent cheaper than high grade steel and therefore are overwhelmingly used in the countrys construction industry
5160183 back then we were paying 430 dollars a tonne about three months ago it was about 940 dollars a tonne but in may india introduced a 15 percent export tax and the price is now around 1 150 to 1 200 dollars
5160184 in the global context of rising costs every penny counts right now
5160185 its a very hazardous job our question is is the amount of steel supplied really enough compensation for the damage the industry is doing to workers and the environment
5160186 the ships are being recycled so we are helping the environment
5160187 we dont dump anything into the sea because everything is worth money so we sell it even the old oil

5160190 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5160191 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5160192 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5160193 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5160194 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5160195 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5160196 we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident
5160197 we will encourage the planning implementation and evaluation of the recommendations in this report as soon as practicable
5160198 but we will certainly be looking at the number and type of beds that are available to do our very best to improve patient welfare and staff effectiveness
5160199 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
5160200 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
5160201 but he still had time for his family on weekends
5160202 up until three years ago he would be at work every morning before i got there
5160203 he was like the caretaker of the community if someone needed a fishing rod or a job hed take them under his wing

5160226 if you could do it over again what would you change about how you have homeschooled in the past
5160227 there are good current and acceptable methods for evaluating these impacts but the project sponsor has not considered any of them
5160228 furthermore all of lower manhattan including the world trade center site and most waterfront land in new york city is in the 100 year flood plain for some reason the city is not concerned with elevating these areas with fill
5160229 no matter how much green technology is employed in its design and construction any new building represents a new impact on the environment

5160249 on that one play fortunately we sacked the qb if not it is a wide open touchdown its just little high school mistakes

5160252 ive been going through this since i was in the 10th grade this is not overwhelming but it is challenging
5160253 for a young kid i feel sorry for him because hes all that we got
5160254 hes good enough to come through but we have to try to protect him a little bit and get him through this first game
5160255 im out there on the field i hear whats happening in the huddle

5160267 the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5160268 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5160269 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5160322 its a big wish for me to dance with beyonc shes beautiful and talented and im very curious what alicia keys would look like on high heels and with lingerie i think we get to see a side of alicia weve never seen before
5160323 im starting to see the bigger picture a little more once i got to the point where i can stop thinking about everything and do it naturally i expect to be a lot better
5160324 tried to stick my nose in the b gap instead of staying outside guys in this league are good and when they see that they take advantage of you
5160325 he didnt get by me in the passing game but every time i blocked him i felt his power hes definitely going to have a good season
5160326 my biggest mistake as a coach is i make assumptions that these guys might know or have been through some of these experiences and that happened a little bit in the preseason opener
5160327 there were a few unique things that happened and they just caught us by surprise because when you look at these guys they didnt play very much last year
5160328 primarily in theory were basically starting over at this position
5160329 none of them can rent a car none of them are old enough
5160330 i have so many notes that i write for them every day i can understand why theyre so confused
5160331 its like trying to put out a forest fire with a garden hose youve got stuff going on everywhere so where do you start
5160332 i have to slap myself sometimes and say you cant assume that they know that youve got to start over again
5160333 its been a lot better this year than it was last year for me in terms of knowing what to do knowing the offense and not having to get yelled at for not being in the right spot
5160334 a second window slant which to the average person means nothing
5160335 a lot of guys wont throw that ball in the second window or the receiver will give up when he runs into a defender
5160336 little things like that are easily overlooked by the average fan i told jerricho dont give up the second window there could be a third window because thats the way ive always played
5160337 thats what im trying to get across to those guys
5160338 the only things that ive tried to get across to them are things that have worked for me in the past you dont have to be the fastest biggest or strongest just be on the same page as me and vice versa i think that was a start saturday
5160339 something just said just run to the next window and hell hit you
5160340 obviously laveranues has been injured and its hard to get timing and stuff down
5160341 but ive been watching a lot of film on these guys from last year seeing how they run routes

5160343 despite the steady escalation of gasoline prices since 2002 canadian drivers have so far not cut back on their consumption
5160344 canadians have only marginally altered their driving habits since 2002 and this is reflected in their use of mass transit
5160345 over a barrel canada and the rising cost of energy
5160346 this study raises questions about how fast people are responding to the shift in energy prices
5160347 while gasoline prices have risen significantly the increase would have been almost twice as much without the rise in the canadian dollar
5160348 in the past drivers in canada have shown they can sharply curtail consumption in the face of higher prices
5160349 may reflect the first move by drivers to boost fuel efficiency in response to higher prices
5160350 your book has saved me and my customers a ton of money
5160351 passed the smog test with only your product installed and no catalytic converter
5160352 i noticed an immediate increase in mileage by 50 after using your product
5160353 i will be sure to tell everyone i know about this new way to save money that works even if you do not drive on the highway
5160354 miraculously it stopped coughing and sputtering after i had a friend install your system
5160355 time and time again i have seen a 40 to 50 mpg increase no matter what they are driving
5160356 there ought to be a law that makes these hho systems mandatory in all cars
5160357 after installing your system which i must say was very easy i almost double my fuel economy

5160372 i have a piece of tissue that looks like a spinal disc a sand bag tough as nails on the outside and like sand on the inside
5160373 you can use a turtles pancreas to filter the salt out and drink it
5160374 if youre cast adrift in the middle of the ocean the last thing on your mind would be to find a turtle to utilize for filtration
5160375 and id be more worried about sharks than trying to find a turtle
5160376 thats what a science teacher in high school taught us
5160377 if you do come across a sea turtle you should just harness it and ride it to shore
5160378 remember your creator in the days of your youth before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say
5160379 ive seen at least three other people do re enactments of john brown
5160380 this was in my opinion one of the best ones it had details in it that even i who has studied the civil war for 20 or 25 years did not know
5160381 i thought i might come and speak to you today about my life and about my struggles against forces beyond me and forces beyond all of us
5160382 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
5160383 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
5160384 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5160385 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5160386 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
5160387 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
5160388 john mccain has never questioned senator obamas patriotism but he clearly does question senator obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe
5160389 it will be an out and out action thriller with high end special effects
5160390 yes i am set to direct a film starring kunal but its too early to disclose any more details

5160401 im offering her a ride home look at the time
5160402 gary ive told you before youll get into trouble banging the employees its against the law and its a violation of the power of trust
5160403 im the one that has to maintain order around here remember you love this bar dont lose it by doing something foolish
5160404 and thank you for hiring me i need this second job so badly
5160405 my no good ex husband is in jail but during our relationship he left me so much debt the creditors are constantly wanting payment
5160406 thankfully my kids are staying with my parents and they are putting them through school for me while i try to work off my debt with creditors
5160407 he would buy stuff on credit card and then sell or pawn off the goods he had three visa cards and four master cards so guess what they all want to get paid
5160408 i sleep occasionally with the landlord when im behind in rent
5160409 i still owe for this month and hes obviously wanting an interest payment to make things worse really a lousy lover
5160410 give him this instead this will cover rent and interest
5160411 oh i cant i wouldnt want to infringe on you youre my new boss

5160429 rangers have been in for adam but i have no interest in letting him go to scotland
5160430 adam can only move during the window and that does not work for us so he wont be going there
5160431 it is going to take an awful lot of money to get him away from us now
5160432 there are two weeks to go in the transfer window and well have added to and strengthened the team by the end of that
5160433 i would hope we get at least another four players in the next two weeks things are progressing very well on some of those players
5160434 hopefully by the middle of next week we might have one or two additions
5160435 i see the young players getting better and better the way gabby agbonlahor and ashley young handle everything on and off the pitch its like they have been playing the game for years
5160436 i think we were a little bit rusty at times in the first half but in the second half i thought we got a little bit more cohesion so im really pleased with the way they finished off the game
5160437 there is still a lot of football to be played but winning tonight was a real positive and not conceding a goal again that was very pleasing
5160438 its always difficult to assess at the start of the season how good denilson will be
5160439 ive played with hesk for a while and seen what he can do for a team theres nobody like him he proved it over the two games he played for england with michael owen last season he came back in and he was magnificent

5160445 pareceu me que ele entrou muito bem a controlar no atletismo que esteve um pouco mais fraquinha n o sei o que aconteceu mas provavelmente foi s a australiana que esteve mais forte
5160446 estou muito feliz e orgulhoso por ter uma irm assim esta medalha diferente das outras porque foi obtida nos jogos ol mpicos
5160447 i dont understand the rules but its exciting to see an olympic event
5160448 this is a games for the local audience and they are having as much fun as you could expect they wont look at it with the same critical eye as a bunch of foreigners
5160449 really achieved the major objective presenting themselves to their country as presenting themselves to the world without actually doing so
5160450 i have not been allowed to visit her and i worry she will not be released after the month is over
5160451 i did say that the olympic games coming to china will help china to open up further and to reform better the fact is after 30 years of reform china has developed greatly
5160452 whether its a recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening theres a degree of happiness

5160458 i dont know if its a statement to the world but its a statement to ourselves that were capable of playing good baseball on a regular basis said ethier whose second home run of the game a two run shot off carlos villanueva erased the mistakes of park and loney and gave the dodgers their third victory of this homestand in their final at bat
5160459 it losing the big lead was a tough thing matt kemp and i looked at each other in the top of that inning and said what the heck is going on
5160460 but we knew we had to jump right back on it luckily we had third base coach larry bowa to remind us that you have to keep getting it done and keep grinding it out
5160461 you may call it a swagger but i call it an inner conceit which is probably the same thing
5160462 we are pretty confident right now we have a feeling we can do some good things we knew we could come back and get a win and that is a good feeling for me as a manager
5160463 lippi knows me well but i want to be judged like all the others and deserve call ups there was a lot of disappointment after the euros but the will to continue was never lacking

5160468 what makes 10th street so unusual is they had a lot of saloons

5160513 subito apparve con langelo che aveva annunziato la nascita del cristo una moltitudine dellesercito celeste che lodava dio e diceva gloria a dio nel pi alto dei cieli e pace in terra agli uomini che egli ama
5160514 mentre stava pensando a queste cose ecco che gli apparve in sogno un angelo del signore che gli disse giuseppe figlio di davide non temere di prendere con te maria destatosi dal sonno giuseppe fece come gli aveva ordinato 1angelo del signore
5160515 un angelo del signore apparve in sogno a giuseppe e gli disse alzati prendi con te il bambino e sua madre e fuggi in egitto

5160517 avvertito in sogno giuseppe con ges e maria si ritir nella regione della galilea e and ad abitare in una citt chiamata nazaret
5160518 pensi forse che io non possa pregare il padre mio che mi darebbe subito pi di dodici legioni di angeli
5160519 guardatevi dal disprezzare uno solo di questi piccoli perch vi dico che i loro angeli nel cielo vedono sempre la faccia del padre mio che nei cieli

5160581 the magisterium has not expressly committed itself to an affirmation of a philosophical nature as to the time of ensoulment but it constantly affirms the moral condemnation of any kind of procured abortion
5160582 just as a microscope reveals that a straight edge is really ragged research on human reproduction shows that the moment of conception is not a moment at all sometimes several sperm penetrate the outer membrane of the egg and it takes time for the egg to eject the extra chromosomes even when a single sperm enters its genes remain separate from those of the egg for a day or more and it takes yet another day or so for the newly merged genome to control the cell so the moment of conception is in fact a span of twenty four to forty eight hours

5160599 in which case they mark it as having gone through international customs
5160600 fine even if you do go through that hassle isnt the customs charge 35 of cost its a seven hundred dollar laptop youre telling me in the instance the laptop is defective youd rather pay 245 twice plus shipping to the manufacturer just to forgo a one time 40 fee to check for said defects that sounds the opposite of frugal

5160655 that some other factors might be required to generate human ips cells
5160656 premature to conclude that ips cells can replace embryonic stem cells
5160657 from about 50 000 transfected human cells we obtained approximately 10 ips cell clones
5160658 this efficiency may sound very low but it means that from one experiment with a single ten centimeter dish you can get multiple ips cell lines
5160659 we should now be able to generate patient and disease specific ips cells and then make various cells such as cardiac cells liver cells and neural cells
5160660 these cells should be extremely useful in understanding disease mechanisms and screening effective and safe drugs if we can overcome safety issues we may be able to use human ips cells in cell transplantation therapies

5160664 there is no prototype there are no standards there is no scientific research that would guarantee any election district that theres a machine that can be used to answer these very serious questions and so my sense is that the politicians in washington have concluded that the system cant be all that bad because after all it produced them and as long as an elected official is an elected official then whatever machine was used whatever device was used to elect him or her seems to be adequate but theres an erosion of voting rights implicit in our inability to trust the technology that we use and if we were another country being analyzed by america we would conclude that this country is ripe for stealing elections and for fraud

5160686 plans are very hush hush but madonna is definitely going to celebrate in style
5160687 unfortunately not everything has gone as expected as shes had many other things on her mind
5160688 ellen degeneres and portia de rossi were married tonight in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles
5160689 shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her
5160690 weve both changed and grown and we just feel like oh okay this is completion
5160691 zac is thinking in the 8 million to 10 million range but it depends on how the movie opens and how
5160692 one of the awards staff asked zac who the straighteners were for and he said vanessa hudgens but it was really for him
5160693 tuhan kirimkanlah aku kekasih yang baik hati yang mencintai aku apa adanya
5160694 music has brought me joy it has given me a beat and a groove sent me down the righteous roads
5160695 because any decision on development has the greatest affect on communities local planning will only be done in agreement with first nations
5160696 it is critical that any development of natural resources in the far north must respect aboriginal and treaty rights while supporting an environmentally sustainable economic future for our people
5160697 well according to a new study coffee can improve your memory thats what they say drinking coffee improves your memory which is good news for both barack obama and john mccain if we can get them to have some coffee before their first debate maybe they can remember what their original positions were
5160698 as you know barack obamas slogan is yes we can hillarys new slogan no you cant
5160699 and that paris hilton ad about john mccain has gotten over five million hits on the web
5160700 and porn star jenna jameson is pregnant boy that john edwards gets around
5160701 barack obama now is giving interviews where hes opening up about his life the candidates want to reveal their personal side in a new interview that just came out barack obama said as a kid he cried when he saw the movie born free very nice yeah yeah meanwhile john mccain said as a kid he cried because movies werent invented yet
5160702 and in an interview recorded by the bbc in africa bill clinton told people in africa to practice monogamy and that we need to control unprotected sexual relations with unlimited numbers of partners
5160703 barack obama heading to hawaii for a vacation with his family
5160704 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage in order to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago his is one of what will likely be many lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle that are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will forcefully respond to these smears with all means at our disposal
5160705 what if no one comes in we have all this great stuff
5160706 i wish i was more like water water is so inviting and people seem to like it better my bigness is intimidating to people so they dont like me as much maybe i should try to be more like water
5160707 gee mountains are way cooler than me watch how everyone looks at them with wonder and amazement they are so beautiful maybe i should try to be more like the mountains
5160708 scouts from the hunter and coastal region come here and even some groups from sydney they get here and just fall in love with it
5160709 the camp teaches scouts how to be independent they get to sit around a camp fire and scout leader training occurs here too
5160710 i meet the groups and check them in were just on site i would say that well more than 100 scout groups visit the camp a year
5160711 we showered out of the buckets and used the rain water for washing clothes cleaning watering the garden and flushing the toilet anything except dinking and cooking
5160712 we were lucky that it did rain a lot through that period and we still used tap water when necessary
5160713 i met my husband tenzin in india where we lived in the northern mountains with the exiled tibetan community and the dalai lama and we had to live off very little water
5160714 we try to buy local organic produce and grow our own vegetables where possible
5160715 we are also careful about what packaging comes with things we buy and how much energy was used to make products common sense things really
5160716 it was a big milestone for us we had to learn new songs the choreography and learn all the dance movements rehearsals were pretty intense
5160717 i had no idea what the judges were going to say when we were announced as the winners i literally passed out i dropped down to the floor i felt so overwhelmed
5160718 if there were any accidents in the lake area wed be the first ones to respond
5160719 in terms of training and capabilities there is no difference between primary and secondary
5160720 primary simply indicates the first to be called to an emergency
5160721 we are not against the skate park we werent informed of the magnitude of it
5160722 everyone is worried about local security there has to be more police and state member for swansea robert coombes has to be pushing for it
5160723 and now they want to jam it through council before the election
5160724 it was mainly because of the space but also because it wont impact residents its already a sports ground
5160725 if they are going to have a skate park it needs to be supervised there are no police
5160726 we are not opposed to a skate park we do think there is a place for it
5160727 but what they are doing it will take away 110 car parks
5160728 one of the things we look at council is the expectations of the community and weigh up what they want now
5160729 it was good to see a lot of kids here involved in the process and having their say
5160730 go to school study hard and get a good job
5160731 als ik jou zie moet ik weer lachen en is alles weer goed
5160732 the department should be closed down and the money left with the american people to use for education at the family local and state levels
5160733 the only federal education program congress wants to get rid of is the one doing the most to help poor kids
5160734 a better way to promote educational opportunity is at the state level
5160735 i commend georgia gov sonny perdue for recently signing into law legislation creating a state income tax credit for individuals and companies that donate to groups which provide private scholarships for students
5160736 private scholarships have become an increasingly important choice mechanism across the nation
5160737 in this way average people who want to improve education can avoid the political obstacles to reforming the public schools
5160738 the failure to adequately educate our children to compete in the international marketplace and to be good citizens in a free society is truly scandalous
5160739 the answers will not come from washington instead they will come from families across america as they educate their own children put their children into private schools and improve the public system

5160750 abraham believed god and it was credited to him as righteousness
5160751 when he came to this country he went to scientific meetings in an open shirt without a tie and was very much disappointed as i advised him to dress as anyone else he told me that he thought this was a country of freedom and the man is only judged according to his internal values and not his external appearance
5160752 i am sorry that you have so many sorrows with your children
5160753 as having a large nose large knobby fingers and an awkward slovenly walk and dress
5160754 bobby has not had a decent meal at home this past month and was sick for two days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or medicine was out of the question i dont think paul would have wanted to leave bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if paul left anything for bobby bobby is still expecting paul
5160755 i take it you know that paul was bobby fischers father the matter is further complicated by the false pretenses about bobbys identity and the parents difference of opinion over the question
5160756 my father left my mother when i was two i have never seen him my mother has only told me that his name was gerhardt and that he was of german descent

5160764 often our strategy for bringing people up to speed on nhibernate has been to rely on word of mouth and osmosis often via pair programming to get the points across but now we have a planned staffing ramp up of a magnitude that will likely make that approach unwieldy
5160765 the idea is to allow the html to dominate the flow and the code to fit seamlessly
5160766 when he says html should dominate the flow hes not kidding check this out
5160767 this is because a layered window is represented to the os as a bitmap so all it can do is look at the pixel values
5160768 your almost transparent brush fails the windows transparency test so windows delivers events to it if something is 100 transparent then hit testing is bypassed if you want transparency and hit testing define a color with minimal alpha just as you have done

5160776 companies are finding that it is indeed possible to trace the source of their cotton and we believe responsible companies have an obligation to do so
5160777 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination
5160778 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning
5160779 we still havent made up our mind and i dont know when we are going to
5160780 the convention is about nominating barack so his people want to speed through the vote as fast as possible so it wont take too much tv time
5160781 strengthening could begin tonight or sunday and fay could be approaching hurricane strength as it nears western cuba
5160782 most of haiti is under heavy rains especially in the south with winds clocked at about 70 kilometers per hour 43 mph
5160783 due to frequent tides we can beach the ship just two hundred yards metres from the coast
5160784 it saves us thousands of dollars for every ship we break whereas in alang and china they beach ships two or three kilometres out into the sea
5160785 were handling ships as big as 80 000 tonnes these days
5160786 the rods made from scrap ships are inferior to those made by top steel producers but theyre at least 20 percent cheaper than high grade steel and therefore are overwhelmingly used in the countrys construction industry
5160787 back then we were paying 430 dollars a tonne about three months ago it was about 940 dollars a tonne but in may india introduced a 15 percent export tax and the price is now around 1 150 to 1 200 dollars
5160788 in the global context of rising costs every penny counts right now
5160789 its a very hazardous job our question is is the amount of steel supplied really enough compensation for the damage the industry is doing to workers and the environment
5160790 the ships are being recycled so we are helping the environment
5160791 we dont dump anything into the sea because everything is worth money so we sell it even the old oil

5160794 we need a pepfar presidents emergency plan for aids relief for orphans in world
5160795 i think its something that we should sit down and figure out working between nongovernmental organizations international institutions the us government try to figure out what can we do
5160796 i think you know im often a critic of president bush but i think the pepfar program has saved lives and has done very good work and he deserves enormous credit for that
5160797 we also need to make adoption a lot easier in this country
5160798 thats why so many people now go to other countries to adopt children

5160800 the chinese leaders keep telling the world the chinese people have religious freedom to even prevent them from receiving bibles certainly contradicts that claim
5160801 i appeal to the chinese government to release those confiscated bibles to the four individuals who deeply care about the chinese believers
5160802 i urge the international christian community to pray for the four courageous fellow brothers for their safety in china

5160815 he sees himself as the object of the sons love
5160816 the character of the hypostasis of the holy spirit is to love by eclipsing himself as the father forgetting himself loves the son in whom he has placed all his joy and as the son is beloved because he puts off his own
5160817 one in whom the father and spirit remain in fullness
5160818 i believe in one lord jesus christ the son of god who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate of the holy spirit and the virgin mary and became man
5160819 from all eternity the place of the presence of the spirit and therefore the incarnate son naturally becomes anointed of the spirit
5160820 christ i e anointed is the term in whom resides the fullness of grace of wisdom of power of authority and holiness that is the fullness of the spirit
5160821 in jesus christ all the fullness of god was pleased to dwell
5160822 conceals himself and somehow blends with his gifts his energies which are the eternal radiance of divinity

5160853 na lembran a fica a pureza a poesia e a leveza de caymmi ele era muito humilde e simples lembro de uma vez que nos encontramos no hall de um hotel em salvador eu fui cumpriment lo e ele pediu para fazerem o meu check in primeiro pois eu era visitante e ainda pediu um aut grafo meu disse que n o poderia chegar em casa sem isso o caymmi me influenciou principalmente na quest o do mar e da melodia mucuripe tem um pouco disso h mais de um ano eu e a nana temos um projeto de m sicas praieiras isso agora pode vir a acontecer em forma de homenagem a ele caymmi era um ser humano maior fica o seu trabalho e a imagem de um homem de cora o leve e humilde
5160854 ele foi o representante mais influente da m sica baiana requebra que eu dou um doce na minha opini o a sua melhor m sica e s isso j dava motivos para imortaliz lo
5160855 caymmi para mim um pilar da arte moderna simples e brasileira eu sou um grande admirador dele desde crian a caymmi partiu como um dos maiores construtores da m sica brasileira
5160856 o caymmi foi uma pessoa muito importante tanto no pessoal quanto no profissional primeiro porque ele era um grande amigo dos meus pais meu pai era compositor e abarcou a obra dele com muito amor lembro que meu pai costumava emprestar a casa que t nhamos na ilha do governador para eles o dori o filho do caymmi tinha asma e precisava respirar ar puro era para l que eles iam no campo profissional acredito que o caymmi foi um marco na m sica popular brasileira ele deixou marcas profundas gra as a sua brasilidade e a forma simples e inteligente de compor sua m sica teve uma penetra o definitiva da m sica brasileira
5160857 o povo vai lembrar de dorival caymmi principalmente pelo que ele representou na d cada de 40 de uma poca em que ele tornou a m sica conhecida atrav s do cinema aquela foi uma fase muito importante depois ele enveredou para uma m sica de classe m dia mais recitada e declamada
5160858 dorival caymmi um dos fundadores da m sica popular brasileira patriarca de uma linhagem de m sicos de talento suas can es praieiras e seus sambas can o s o patrim nio da cultura nacional brilhou e inovou como compositor m sico e cantor sua m sica uma completa tradu o da bahia sua obra permanecer sempre viva na mem ria dos brasileiros iluminando a todos com a gra a e a alegria de suas m sicas

5160863 estou bastante emocionado ele j me chamou de ourives do palavreado eu comparo a perda dele a uma cat strofe ecol gica ficamos sem mar sem vento sem rio sem floresta ficamos num deserto

5160885 well sir you obviously havent had it done in this kind of car before it takes a special kind of fluid you probably take your cars to places like aamco dont you
5160886 you let your kids play with razor blades dont you
5160887 in fact sir we call it liquid gold sir if you dont want to do it today thats fine but we are giving you a break on the price because you are having your 30 000 mile check done we are cutting 100 off the cost or you could take it to aamco
5160888 sir did you know that your left umbrage pin is worn and is about to break causing the rear half of your car to explode on the freeway creating a traffic jam and multi car pileup that your insurance wont cover and your ancestors to 8 generations will be paying off we can fix it but it means dropping the gas tank and rotating your tires so i figure since youre already getting your wipers done we can knock a 100 off and just do it for 1400 what do you think

5161044 everything he did was from the heart on and off the field he played last week i can still see him running down the sidelines against warringah you never lose memory of those sort of things
5161045 he is a great young club man involved in everything he will be sadly missed
5161046 he is very quick he is an important role on the wing and fall back
5161047 he was a fit young boy and he wanted to spread his wings with other people
5161048 its sad to hear about it its a shock because you dont expect anything to happen
5161049 in kosovo the u s carried out military actions without un approval unilaterally imposed a reality on serbia created an independent kosovo in opposition to russian desires and simply felt it had the right along with the european powers to redefine the situation of serbia the russians are saying if the u s and eu have that power in serbia the russians have the same power in georgia
5161050 the french have taken the lead on the diplomatic front but geography dictates that the german response is even more critical in particular we need to watch how europe handles the situation whether there is european unity in crafting a response to russia whether the european union and nato follow similar courses and what stresses emerge inside europe and in the transatlantic relationship closer to russia ukraine is the next area to watch

5161063 pet owners can do their part to gauge their dog or cats health by regularly looking for irregularities in a pets appetite water consumption urination and defecation attitude or energy level spotting changes in these signs early is critical to the long term health of pets
5161064 keeping pets ears clean and doing a weekly exam to identify changes or redness early will help dogs and cats avoid more irritating painful and expensive ear infections the longer a problem is allowed to persist the more difficult it is to treat
5161065 dogs love to get into food that isnt necessarily good for their health
5161066 to prevent stomach irritation feed pets high quality diets not table scraps and make sure they dont eat chocolate bones toys or get into the garbage
5161067 pet owners can control many of these cases by feeding a quality diet to their pet and seeing their veterinarian early since stomach problems may indicate other internal conditions
5161068 if you observe your dog urinating more frequently than normal promptly contact your veterinarian so that treatment with antibiotics can begin as soon as possible
5161069 be alert to the symptoms of frequent urination and house soiling and contact your veterinarian at the first signs
5161070 theres not much a pet owner can do to prevent hyperthyroidism or arthritis
5161071 but in the case of arthritis dog owners are in the best position to spot early symptoms of this painful disease
5161072 the scene was very tragic the aircraft had come down in the woods there was a clearing where it crashed through
5161073 it was upside down and the top of the roof was crushed one of the engines was some distance away
5161074 it was really very difficult to get into the aircraft we were having to rip off the skin with our hands
5161075 the twin engined aircraft was on quite a low approach to coventry on the normal land path when a smaller aircraft came from the right and the twin engined aircraft struck it side on
5161076 the smaller plane disintegrated immediately and the right engine of the twin aircraft blew up
5161077 whilst we watched the twin engined aircraft bank steeply to the left with smoke coming from its right engine it seemed to level off and climb slightly before dropping steeply down to the left
5161078 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50 feet up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane
5161079 it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees
5161080 but then i realised that the plane was going down and it disappeared into the woods
5161081 it was weird because there was no bang i couldnt believe what i had seen
5161082 two of them were not only commercial pilots but they were also fully qualified instructors they had many many thousands of hours of flying time between them
5161083 it is an absolute tragedy for us because we are a small company we are like a family we know everyone extremely well our thoughts and prayers are with the families
5161084 it had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry
5161085 it was approximately two miles from the runway we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft
5161086 it was a very very routine piece of work and the plane was about to land in a normal routine fashion
5161087 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
5161088 some of these things come back right away and theyre ready to go a lot of players play with these things

5161138 we had to struggle with the enemies of peace business and financial monopoly speculation reckless banking class antagonism sectionalism war profiteering
5161139 they had begun to consider the government of the united states as a mere appendage to their own affairs we know now that government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob
5161140 a conscious government policy of redistributing income and wealth and power upward
5161141 to the demise of social and economic democracy at home
5161142 it is a work in progress an agenda for congress that dsa hopes will begin a broad discussion of how politically to restore progressive taxation defend and expand high quality public provision and social insurance empower working people in the labor market create universal programs that are genuinely universal and that address racial ethnic and gender disparities and that create a global economy that raises global living and human rights standards rather than debasing them
5161143 i might have my assistant saddle two and ill saddle two but i dont like anybody to feel slighted

5161150 ive had trouble getting her in a race i had her in a race friday that came off the turf her numbers are just so much better on the grass than on the dirt that i felt it was foolish to take her off the turf
5161151 she came back off a long layoff weve entered her twice and shes been rained off twice were going to give her a shot shes a nice filly shes run pretty good numbers
5161152 its a pretty wide open race who knows what would have happened if we went into the preakness but i feel we have arrived here in pretty good shape
5161153 no i am not a muslim but it would make no difference even if i were
5161154 hmm ok so he threw his volunteer outreach guy under the bus im convinced

5161164 mahesh from what you tell me about your lifestyle i think life is much better for me i dont have to do my own laundry clean the house or wash the dishes we have servants for a lot of things now our maid comes every afternoon cleans the whole place up and everythings cool isnt life hard for you doing all of it yourself and you say all americans do it man that must be tough maintaining your homes and apartments
5161165 even death bitches say hi to me she tell her blind friends and she say i gotta see
5161166 damn right i wanna trade cards i can beat you ive got charizard
5161167 no diet will remove all the fat from your body because the brain is entirely fat without a brain you might look good but all you could do is run for public office
5161168 the devil has put a penalty on all things we enjoy in life either we suffer in health or we suffer in soul or we get fat
5161169 a conservative is a man who is too cowardly to fight and too fat to run
5161170 dont dig your grave with your own knife and fork
5161171 more die in the united states of too much food than of too little
5161172 ive decided that perhaps im bulimic and just keep forgetting to purge
5161173 in the middle ages they had guillotines stretch racks whips and cahins nowadays we have a much more effective torture device called the bathroom scale
5161174 its okay to be fat so youre fat just be fat and shut up about it
5161175 i feel about airplanes the way i feel about diets it seems to me that they are wonderful things for other people to go on
5161176 the one way to get thin is to re establish a purpose in life
5161177 avoid any diet that discourages the use of hot fudge
5161178 the biggest seller is cookbooks and the second is diet books how not to eat what youve just learned how to cook
5161179 gluttony is an emotional escape a sign something is eating us
5161180 if i had been around when rubens was painting i would have been revered as a fabulous model kate moss well she would have been the paintbrush
5161181 food is like sex when you abstain even the worst stuff begins to look good
5161182 the second day of a diet is always easier than the first by the second day youre off it
5161183 govern well thy appetite lest sin surprise thee and her black attendant death
5161184 people say that losing weight is no walk in the park when i hear that i think yeah thats the problem
5161185 as for food half of my friends have dug their graves with their teeth
5161186 to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing
5161187 i am not a glutton i am an explorer of food
5161188 damn right i wanna trade cards i can beat you ive got charizard
5161189 even death bitches say hi to me she tell her blind friends and she say i gotta see

5161192 russias invasion of georgia strikes at the heart of western values and our 21st century system of security if the international community allows russia to crush our democratic independent state it will be giving carte blanche to authoritarian governments everywhere
5161193 unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
5161194 some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along
5161195 we have heard this foolish delusion before as nazi tanks crossed into poland in 1939 an american senator declared lord if i could only have talked to hitler all this might have been avoided we have an obligation to call this what it is the false comfort of appeasement which has been repeatedly discredited by history
5161196 lets just chat about it and try to convince them otherwise
5161197 anything that is powered by a motor and has wheels
5161198 lets get on a hog and go for a ride babe
5161199 sources very very reliable tell me alvarez is going to happen
5161200 we scooped the heck out of that story on extra innings yesterday
5161201 im the guy talking to people in the game who know whats going on
5161202 i just kind of sat there for a minute and it didnt go away and i was like oh no it really did scare me the way the pain was running all the way up my leg i hadnt rolled my ankle since high school and that didnt feel like this
5161203 his arm action is the same on every pitch and thats what makes it so tough
5161204 i made some bad pitches and they hit them hard
5161205 i expect better and ill get back at it tomorrow
5161206 you do look at decisions around baseball always but we have to look at ryan zimmerman those guys did perform at a level where theyve moved quickly but pedro alvarez is going to be his own guy weve got to give him what he needs for his skill set but i think he can be challenged pretty quickly
5161207 obviously there are some challenges because youve got to figure out who fits where but theyre good challenges to have
5161208 i know some people have made a big deal out of having andy laroche neil walker and alvarez all at third base well you know what we have to find a way where all three can be part of this the biggest thing is making sure they all get their opportunities
5161209 those were not routine plays this is a good third baseman
5161210 clearly hitters are squaring up on his pitches and thats something he and jeff andrews are working on
5161211 we hope to get at least two games in this week
5161212 as of now were playing the game monday if the storm runs in its current path tuesday would be in doubt we should know monday night about tuesday
5161213 our biggest concern is that guys can be with their families if something happens

5161226 he should tender his resignation pack up his bags and go
5161227 whatever little moral authority was left has now been completely eroded
5161228 this thing must be clear to everyone that is not going to resign period
5161229 this is an issue that is not on the table
5161230 we want stability in the country we want political stability

5161244 you always make me the quitter me the one that is giving up and i dont want to be that person
5161245 if thats the way you feel then youve gotta have the balls to do it
5161246 the plans ar wel advanced for a third fase of the columbia library school for which a real want has been found which can not otherwise be fild
5161247 at present they hav absolutely no help except to write at random to librarians those whose advice is worth anything ar all crowed with their own duties and tho in good nature they answer a letter or two even zealous missionaries rebel if called on to meet all the needs of such a home pupil
5161248 acting on the offer to allow library assistants to work for readers at a distance for what their actual time was worth we hav received many letters similar to this
5161249 but more and more hav askt for sumthing more systematic and extensiv and the suggestion has come from leading librarians burdend with numerous queries as wel as from those seeking such help
5161250 our plan is to lay out the course that should be taken and then prepare the lessons in print or by duplicating processes so they can be maild
5161251 we expect to develop among our own teachers and pupils sum who wil show special fitness by nature for this work and who recognizing the field for usefulness wil be glad to giv their time to the correspondence classes
5161252 few applicants ar expected outside those now engaged in library work for no one ought to hope to make any repsectabl preparation without the advantages of being daily in a library
5161253 any one who completes a regular course of such study and passes satisfactory writn examinations wil be entitled of course to the certificate of graduation from the correspondence course by no one wil for a moment look on that as equivalent to regular school graduation
5161254 the new idea wil be welcumd by accomplisht members of the profession as relieving them of the growing burden of personal assistance to mere apprentices
5161255 in fact most questions sent to prominent librarians ar very elementary to one thuroly verst in library economy
5161256 i hav no time to answer all your questions i can hardly stagger thru the day with my own pressing duties
5161257 you should be okay but you need to build up your confidence
5161258 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
5161259 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
5161260 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant
5161261 i dont think were out of the woods yet on financials because i dont think were out of the woods on housing
5161262 when we have new orders thats going to tell you are people ready to put stuff on the shelf
5161263 its important because one of the big drags on the gdp in the second quarter was inventory

5161272 im not feeling all the pressures that would burden my mind the 24 year old first baseman said
5161273 a pitch would come in at 85 mph and itd be by me now if a bad day happens theres always tomorrow
5161274 thats the kind of thing where faith helps he said
5161275 i worried last year and all it got me was demoted from double a to
5161276 i was just swinging away and hoping the ball hit the bat now im more mature and im putting my trust in god hes the reason the balls are going farther
5161277 he said ive got to turn it up a notch
5161278 he takes a good cut and hes got a good idea of the strike zone
5161279 the good news is obviously no state is better prepared or organized to deal with whatever comes this way than the state of florida
5161280 youll be in our thoughts and prayers i am very impressed by what youre doing and what youre prepared to do coming from a state that is not often hit by a hurricane im incredibly impressed
5161281 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come

5161295 in london i was part of a group of iraqi painters and writers who decided to visit baghdad to see what we could do in the sphere of cultural education
5161296 extremely important without cultural education we cannot emerge from saddam husseins dictatorship properly without it we cannot resist the ideas of religious fundamentalism
5161297 we formed out of a moral obligation to respond to the human rights crisis
5161298 we catch about 3500 most of them are bad people
5161299 if she had been a 14 year old girl from tucson that would have been front page news
5161300 no more deaths is famous in the border town of nogales
5161301 the primary reason the migrants and no more deaths are out in these remote desert areas is because the policy of the united states has been to build large walls around the urban areas where people could easily cross the border now migrants are forced into the rugged desert mountains of southern arizona which has turned the region into a long graveyard
5161302 the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another
5161303 the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand
5161304 ummm im just wondering what the lizard is grabbing hold of
5161305 now theres a lizard who really enjoys his breakfast cereal
5161306 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
5161307 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
5161308 weve been in that funk the last couple of years
5161309 there will be some defaults at the local government level but at the state level its unimaginable
5161310 we viewed this as an opportunity to buy higher yield muni bonds without taking undue credit risk
5161311 some cdo assets will be fine on a credit basis but have been discounted already or may be in the future simply because of the taint of the structure theyre held in theres great collateral out there but its languishing in the wrong box
5161312 hopefully this type of investing will clear out a lot of these bad assets and contribute to jump starting the market again and providing funding for people who should have home loans
5161313 the next generation standard for prenatal and oncology molecular diagnostics
5161314 it is one of my top picks for the year
5161315 with the 99 detection rate and zero false positives false negatives seen to date in clinical testing we think the test will immediately compete well in the down syndrome screening market
5161316 if you like working for xerox stay right there but we have to change your bracket
5161317 ill take this on but only for an interim period otherwise the work wont get done well
5161318 what value will i have to this company even when i leave
5161319 we really thought we had a good chance to have at least one guy in that final
5161320 youre always surprised when a great athlete doesnt make the finals
5161321 i thought man ive got to dig deep today to get in
5161322 i tried to maintain that get into the fifth spot but didnt make it you know what life goes on
5161323 who spent 10 years in a kenyan refugee camp carried the u s flag in the opening ceremony he too was not expressing disappointment usa vs china live
5161324 were not saying we believe in sasquatch but if anyones ever going to capture an image of one were guessing itll be a hunter with a trail camera thats why bushnell is offering a chance at 1 000 000 to the first person using one who snaps a verifiable photo of the beast
5161325 bonus category for all you jokers out there were giving away an additional bushnell trail scout pro camera for your best attempt to cheat bushnell out of their 1 000 000 prize so go grab your gorilla suit and head to the nearest woodlot just dont get mistaken for a bear please use caution when taking photographs outdoors and in the wild especially when using suits or costumes that resemble wild animals gorilla sasquatch or other
5161326 provide an unaltered photograph video verified and substantiated by a panel of scientific experts including a zoologist and biologist the evidence required to prove a sasquatch bigfoot yeti exists
5161327 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5161328 this is unbelievable were winning races were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5161329 ten points is 10 points the beauty of it is keeping kyle from getting 10 points hes so fast you cant give him any room
5161330 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5161331 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5161332 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5161333 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5161334 carls right there he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5161335 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5161336 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5161337 africa and the africans in the age of the atlantic slave trade
5161338 the plantation system of farming with a dependent enslaved work force characterized by the production of many tropical and semitropical crops in demand in europe became the locus of african and afro american life
5161339 there was virtually no occupation that slaves did not perform although the vast majority lived their lives as agricultural laborers
5161340 the combination of natural growth and the relatively small direct trade from africa reduced the degree of african cultural reinforcement in comparison with cuba or brazil
5161341 the practice of harnessing supernatural forces and spirits for ones own personal use
5161342 the obeah man and women played a prominent role in the caribbean slave societies from the beginning of the slave trade the functioned as community leaders and teachers of the african folks cultural heritage
5161343 baker exemplified the revolutionary in action transcending more attendant concerns and reaching for something larger greater more inspirational
5161344 particularly in the rural parishes of southeast louisiana roman catholicism provided a venue for religious as well as social and economic opportunities for enslaved and free african americans
5161345 the ways and customs of the master that were both imposed and adopted
5161346 invisible southern black women leaders in the civil rights movement the triple constraints of gender race and class
5161347 express ing a communal recognition that infanticide was bred by a system that unjustly exploited black women by trying to control their sexuality and their capacity to be mothers
5161348 he talked about commitment and he asked are you ready
5161349 our career services has refocused their core programming to be more self reflective for students
5161350 we ask what does it take to be a leader what are your weaknesses and what can you work on
5161351 the ionsound residency will be great for our undergraduate and graduate composers because our students will be able to work with this ensemble on an ongoing basis
5161352 the group is open to new music of all styles and will help the students develop their craft through rehearsing and performing their compositions
5161353 because we are a liberal arts department not a conservatory we lack the performance resources of those institutions
5161354 instead we bring professional ensembles to perform on our music on the edge new music series and then invite them to stay to work with our graduate composers
5161355 working with professional musicians and a distinguished composition faculty is the best way to learn the art of composition now pitt will have both
5161356 such increased amounts of debt also should allow firms to leverage up their return on equity
5161357 its pretty clear to anyone looking at the research that if firms lower environmental risks theyll be able to raise equity capital more cheaply
5161358 obviously if cost of capital goes down its a great benefit
5161359 weve broadened the ability of firms to make an argument for environmental efforts
5161360 our heads not in the sand regarding fuel economy it helps to be the best or among the best in the segment when you have consumers studying choices within the segment
5161361 were the third most fuel efficient brand out there its just that there are people who dont know about hyundai
5161362 part d continues to come in under budget achieve consistently high satisfaction rates and with it millions of americans are living healthier better lives
5161363 most beneficiaries will see a premium increase in their current plan there will be some significant increases
5161364 first there is a trend in prescription drug cost growth generally prices tend to increase because of price increases for existing drugs the growth in the average number of prescriptions per person and the introduction of new drugs
5161365 so they have adjusted their 2009 bids to reflect those higher than anticipated costs
5161366 in addition 97 percent of people in stand alone prescription drug plans will have access to a 2009 plan with equal or lower cost premiums than their 2008 plan
5161367 moreover many medicare beneficiaries will have access to a medicare advantage plan that offers lower prescription drug premiums than a stand alone plan
5161368 we are paying for better outcomes and we are getting higher quality and more value for the medicare dollar
5161369 and these results show that by working in collaboration with the physician groups on new and innovative ways to reimburse for high quality care we are on the right track to find a better way to pay physicians
5161370 i couldnt ask for more my husbands home with us everythings wonderful
5161371 the armed forces will not let them come home without the red cross stamp of approval
5161372 i left where i was stationed on the 10th but i didnt leave the country until the 11th and then i got home on the 12th
5161373 when he left for deployment i didnt know i was pregnant
5161374 he found out through text message that i was pregnant i tried calling him when i took the test but couldnt reach him i took a picture of the pregnancy test and texted it to him
5161375 he called me back and kept saying wow wow he was pretty excited weve been trying for years to get pregnant and were scared it wasnt possible for us
5161376 it wasnt the timing we expected but it definitely was the blessing we wanted
5161377 she had left a couple messages that she was in the hospital in labor then her sister called after and said the baby boy was fine
5161378 when i get back from afghanistan i plan on joining the mckeesport police force
5161379 my small team who i picked myself is 100 trustworthy
5161380 no employee can be trusted and well make sure they never get anything over on us
5161381 asyik pak keren bisa punya email dengan nama sekolah sendiri
5161382 maaf nak gurumu ini sungguh katrok dan sekolahmu penuh keterbatasan jadi ini hanya ini yang mampu diberikan maaf kalo seadanya dan sederhana terlebih masih nyantol di gmail dan datangnya telat sekali lagi maaf
5161383 i didnt meet him until i arrived in new york but its a good story go ahead and use it i wont tell
5161384 theyre doing jobs for us we dont have the manpower to do
5161385 people ask what im doing and they ask me if i get paid
5161386 to the instant reaction of his co horts he says
5161387 instead of doing nothing in the summer this was doing something meaningful
5161388 we want to assure the city of real value so these kids do real work
5161389 a lot of these kids had never worked with tools before
5161390 some have never worked outside or been in the woods
5161391 my mom told me i was going to work and that i was going to do this she wanted me out of the house
5161392 shall the county enact an ordinance to increase real estate taxes in order to repeal the alcoholic drink tax
5161393 this is the first step in challenging that whole process that they went through to put a referendum question on the ballot
5161394 the lawsuit is an attempt to reverse the power they gave themselves they are circumventing the county charter
5161395 the administrative code requires us to return the petition to fact
5161396 we have a problem with the wording of the anti drink tax referendum question it simply asks the voter to make a decision if they want lower taxes
5161397 our real goal here is that students get current up to date information and that they learn about it in an exciting way
5161398 it answers the question whether its math or science or english why do i have to learn this
5161399 every person every day i was there voiced the same complaint that people arent taught proper e mail etiquette
5161400 we have to spend a little more time on those things that we take for granted
5161401 theres a lot of good paying jobs here but they have to know how to find them
5161402 there are excellent jobs high paying jobs available and were never going to get them filled if we dont have students coming in
5161403 weve got to get them into real world positions weve got to build it from the ground up
5161404 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
5161405 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
5161406 but he still had time for his family on weekends
5161407 up until three years ago he would be at work every morning before i got there
5161408 he was like the caretaker of the community if someone needed a fishing rod or a job hed take them under his wing
5161409 if one needed an odd job he always had them doing stuff
5161410 its been interesting to see at the funeral home all the lives he touched not just the big guy from the bank but a vast array of people
5161411 we backed off and let the experts handle it they went through everything
5161412 multiple assault type weapons were found various handguns altered firearms and unlawful possession firearms ammunition for those weapons homemade incendiary devices and military type incendiary devices
5161413 i knew he had a lot of guns hes a hunter but the explosives i dont know nothing about that
5161414 electronic theorists have been using the wrong pair of variables all these years voltage and charge the missing part of electronic theory was that the fundamental pair of variables is flux and charge
5161415 the simplest word i can use to describe mcgee was kindness
5161416 he was the kindest man ive ever met and it didnt matter who you were he treated everybody like that
5161417 let me put it this way he was the best man at my wedding and he was the godfather for both of my children
5161418 i met him when i went out for the basketball team at st marys in fifth grade and hes been close to me ever since a day wouldnt go by that we didnt talk
5161419 but we still talked every day i never made a move without checking with him
5161420 as a coach he just wanted it to be fun for us
5161421 he gave me my first big chance and im forever grateful to him he was just a wonderful man
5161422 i can honestly say he was the best coach ive ever been exposed to on any level
5161423 you dont realize that when youre a high school kid but he had his teams so well prepared and ready to play he preached toughness and discipline
5161424 plus as a guy hed do anything for you hed let us use his car im talking about a bunch of high school kids he was all about loyalty of course he expected that loyalty in return he was one of a kind and we were blessed to have him
5161425 we still feel theres a small group were not reaching
5161426 school breakfast really is the most important meal of the day
5161427 he couldve ended up dead im really angry at the people who dont follow the rules
5161428 the real concerns are people driving 4 000 pound machines that have the ability to kill pedestrians cyclists and people in wheelchairs
5161429 in 22 years of commuting to oakland i have never seen a cyclist stop at a red light or stop sign
5161430 theres a physics argument on why some bikers dont stop at stop signs
5161431 i dont see why bikes are special and not subject to the speed limit
5161432 it is my intention to make sure everyone understands those laws
5161433 my client was not under arrest he had not participated in any criminal acts and according to the allegheny county district attorneys office he was not about to be arrested for any reason
5161434 therefore the question remains how can a man die in the custody of the police when he is not the suspect of any criminal activity
5161435 attacked struck kicked punched bludgeoned beat repeatedly shocked him with a taser
5161436 we expect our officers to use some degree of judgment and discretion on the street
5161437 police thought he was dangerous how dangerous to whom in order to know if its ok to have used an electroshock weapon on a person you have to know what kind of danger this person posed you use the amount of force to meet the danger presented
5161438 if the guy is using fists youre one step ahead you use pepper spray but its messy it can get in your eyes you could use your night stick or metal baton but thats going to open some wounds up if the persons bigger than you and you shoot them you could kill them if you use the taser it will put them down in a heartbeat
5161439 police use it as a weapon of first choice thats the pattern weve noticed
5161440 plaintiffs will lose out on a fair amount of exposure and the opportunity to express their views in a popular forum
5161441 on the other hand halting this event would deny the other candidates the opportunity to be heard and would deprive the public of an opportunity to see the candidates and hear their views
5161442 forcing saddleback to include another candidate at the last moment could cause serious logistical problems and take away from the presentations of other candidate
5161443 will have many other opportunities in the coming months to express their views and make their candidacy known
5161444 it is our opinion that the saddleback church forum failed to publish any pre established objective criteria for inviting candidates to the event
5161445 because of saddlebacks apparent failure to comply with campaign finance laws the exclusion of bob barr appears to be an illegal corporate in kind contribution to senators obama and mccain
5161446 the cost in terms of liberties lost and the unnecessary exposure to terrorism are difficult to determine but in time it will become apparent to all of us that foreign interventionism is of no benefit to american citizens but is instead a threat to our liberties
5161447 we are concerned over the unfolding of developments in the valley
5161448 there exists no government worth its name in kashmir and the prevailing situation in the valley is the result of the appeasement policy being pursued by upa at the centre and vohra whose statements have simply served to embolden the kashmiri extremists and further enraged the already rather angry and alienated people of jammu
5161449 the administration in kashmir has been it appears taken over by the extremists with the authorities either watching the disturbing developments and anti national activities as mute spectators or with some of them extending overt and covert support to the right wing islamists so that they could accomplish their ulterior designs to destroy all the indian symbols in the valley
5161450 the employees were deported in the intervening night of august 13 14 using the srtc buses
5161451 and that this shows the extent to which things have deteriorated in kashmir
5161452 kashmir has turned extremely intolerant towards the minorities because of vohra
5161453 remarkable movement since june 23 against communal approach of separatist and communal leaders as also of the congress the national conference and the pdp towards the issue of land diversion to the shrine board
5161454 tolerance in the jammu region saying that there is not a single case which one can cite to prove that the people of jammu have harassed any kashmir based muslim working and living here
5161455 all this should establish beyond any shadow of doubt that the jammu leadership is tolerant and that of kashmir not only extremely intolerant but also regressive
5161456 communal and parochial hindu versus muslim and jammu versus kashmir
5161457 very nose of the authorities to the manner in which the authorities helped the extremists to make their august 15 blackout call a great success
5161458 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
5161459 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
5161460 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5161461 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5161462 it was hypocritical for the government to sell uranium to countries like china and russia which despite being part of the pact use uranium for weapons
5161463 how can we justify selling the uranium to china and to russia in an unfettered way and yet we dont sell uranium to india
5161464 we have done everything that had to be done and now we expect the nsg exemption without any change to the draft that was circulated to them recently
5161465 we expect the process to move consistent with the july 18 2005 understanding and any change in their nsg position is problematic
5161466 we can not agree to further demands and there is no way we can
5161467 children 10 hide children view in hierarchy add child page
5161468 when i had a conversation with him theres not a malicious bone in this guys body hes a huge part of our potential weve got to eradicate that part of the way he plays

5161471 i learnt pahadi songs from my mother who was from a village in himachal i also learnt the hindustani classical music from a few gurus during my childhood
5161472 some people ask me how can i love classical and rock music at the same time i tell them that music is the word of god so where is the discrimination songs will stay till the end of life
5161473 like web oriented news consumers integrators are affluent and highly educated however they are older on average than those who consider the internet their main source of news
5161474 the indo us nuclear deal is important for indias energy security and i think swiss government will most likely support the waiver for new delhi at the nsg meet
5161475 the nuclear deal is good for india and it should be allowed to go through
5161476 it is a decision that has to be taken by the government the parliament has no role to play in it but i am confident that the government will take a favourable stand on the issue
5161477 how much better are modern tools compared to the ones of say 10 years ago
5161478 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
5161479 failure to rapidly and completely implement the accord would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
5161480 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5161481 wir sehen keinen anlass f r ver nderungen im conti vorstand
5161482 es w re w nschenswert wenn die bahn bei der erstellung des prospekts sehr prominent auf das thema und die damit wom glich verbundenen risiken hinweist
5161483 das land nordrhein westfalen ist bereit seinen anteil an der westlb zu verkaufen der preis muss nat rlich stimmen
5161484 es finden keine kaufverhandlungen zwischen der dekabank und dem land nordrhein westfalen ber die anteile des landes an der westlb statt

5161489 man i dont go to your work and threaten you what makes you think its ok to do the same to me
5161490 stevil this storys kinda long but so is life read it and share in my frustrations and mixed emotions if youd like feel free to share them with others too bad to get mad kev
5161491 hey man well henry get off the phone i gotta hey man i gotta straighten my face this mellow black chick just put my spine out of place
5161492 yeah ive been wrenchin about 9 years and its hard theres a lot of rookies out there and you got to be careful
5161493 well heres some more crap that kinda goes with the other email kinda like
5161494 its a topic that im very interested in so im happy to hear that people are cooperating in gathering the information
5161495 if the voters approve any other statewide amendments well be looking at a three day work week
5161496 im happy to give you a little background but generally speaking these organizations have a different source of funding opportunity other than the city
5161497 we had a request for an event at the mlk center a few months back that uf student government refused to fund and we gave them the money instead but i think that issue should be discussed at the committee
5161498 our attacking play in the first half was good but as soon as we lost ryan giggs to a hamstring injury and michael carrick with an ankle we lost a bit of our experience in midfield
5161499 we ended up having to push patrice evra out to the left side of midfield and he is obviously not our best attacking player being a left back
5161500 in the context of the season we can come from behind theres no question about that
5161501 there are 37 games left and its not a disaster we lacked real width and penetration to make a make a difference to that game and that was a real problem
5161502 the city of forth worth proves you can live in the city and still feel like youre down home country
5161503 forget the stetsons i dont even know what those are wranglers and boots just for a second ok think night on the town dress shoes i have those think hipster i can be hip gq jacket tie combos is this an attempt at a metrosexual reference and chick dresses think arty and cool and yes youre still in fort worth
5161504 an upscale maze of danceatoriums chill out lounges and live music venues
5161505 extraordinary contempt and defiance beyond the usual call of engineering
5161506 i have a piece of tissue that looks like a spinal disc a sand bag tough as nails on the outside and like sand on the inside
5161507 in a month the torn tissue will be completely regrown and healed
5161508 i wish i could have had a procedure like this
5161509 this will lead to human treatments but they cant move as fast as we can
5161510 after a few weeks of lab growth it will turn into something that resembles a tendon but it has to be the mechanical equivalent and we dont know that were there
5161511 stem cells are very promising but what they do for horses may not work so well for humans because humans are the hardest animal to rebuild
5161512 often that injury is a complete tear the ligament is snapped in two and the ends ball up and even if you untangle them and pull them together they wont heal
5161513 so they take part of the patella tendon which is short and tough and stretch it and staple it to the bones so not only is your acl not working too well and you have to stretch it out but your knee hurts like crazy
5161514 if we can learn to grow a tendon that works right or figure out how to make the acl heal back together we can save a lot of people a lot of pain
5161515 the body knows how to heal itself were speeding up and concentrating the process
5161516 ninety three percent got better with a single injection and stayed better for two years
5161517 i will guess that five years from now insurance companies wont authorize surgery until the patient has tried and failed at prp
5161518 we dont always know how stem cells when injected into some tissues work their magic
5161519 veterinarians dont go back and study the horses tendons to figure out what the stem cells did to promote healing
5161520 there are all kinds of ways stem cells could work if we could understand how they are actually promoting better function of the tissue we might be able to further improve their therapeutic effects
5161521 youre putting in cells that want to grow that has to be under control
5161522 theres a nagging feeling that theres a cancer stem cell that when its agitated by exposure to carcinogens or radiation or something it goes nuts and that we cant identify it from the other stem cells
5161523 how do you find this bad boy and pull him out

5161527 i will cross the bridge when i come to it
5161528 how can i save or invest when i cant feed myself and my family today
5161529 a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men
5161530 penjagaan perlu diperketat sebab siapa tahu saat menjelang hari eksekusi mati ada pihak yang ingin membuat kekacauan di sini
5161531 para supir yang membunuh orang lain akibat kelalaian berkendaraan kini tidak bisa lagi melenggang bebas meninggalkan pengadilan dengan hanya membayar denda
5161532 satu saat karena kondisi fokus perhatian terpecah bisa berakibat fatal antara hidup dan mati
5161533 membiarkan pemecah konsentrasi mempengaruhi standard berkendaraan memang tidak bisa diterima dan sekarang pelakuknya bakal dihukum dengan lebih tegas lagi berdasarkan aturan hukum
5161534 akan sangat bermanfaat bila kita punya lebih banyak lagi polisi lalu lintas yang menyetop para pelanggar aturan lalu lintas sebelum mereka melanggar hukum lebih jauh lagi dan menyebabkan tragedi kecelakaan maut
5161535 saya mendengar suara seperti ledakan dan kemudian asap tebal berwarna hitam sudah memenuhi beberapa bagian ruangan
5161536 skornya agak berlebihan tapi di lain pihak tim telah menunjukkan mereka bisa mencetak gol yang bagus
5161537 kami solid dalam pertahanan tetapi yang dihitung adalah meraih poin dan memenangi pertandingan
5161538 kami punya kesempatan siang ini dan memalukan kami tidak mengambilnya
5161539 jika kami ingin tetap berada dalam ligue 1 kami harus fokus pada kualitas permainan kami
5161540 kami melakukan itu karena kami datang ke china kami tidak ingin melakukan sesuatu yang buruk bagi masyarakat china maupun asia
5161541 kami berpendapat foto itu buruk tapi kami tidak pernah bermaksud menyinggung siapapun kami tidak menganggap isyarat itu tindakan rasial
5161542 ya tentu saja kami tidak pernah ingin melakukan sesuatu yang buruk
5161543 sangat jelas bahwa foto itu tidak pantas kami tahu anggota tim telah minta maaf dan tidak bermaksud menyinggung atau apapun itu
5161544 this unusual subject matter is presented with wry humor including original songs and real ufo footage and its sure to be a cult fave
5161545 the right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins
5161546 the cleburne clinic served as a model for our organization to set up clinics in other cities
5161547 we have stand alone clinics in denton and fort worth and satellite programs in eight other cities
5161548 in our relationship with the north there always exists the possibility of localized conflict so we cannot afford to loosen our readiness
5161549 to start a new war on the peninsula and stifle the north with force
5161550 it is quite nonsensical for the u s to offer a handshake to its dialogue partner while holding a dagger in its other hand
5161551 taking zizek from the front deleuze on nietzsche on zizek
5161552 if we do not discover its target the whole of nietzsches philosophy remains abstract and barely comprehensible
5161553 nietzsche emphasizes the fact that force has another force as its object but it is important to see that forces enter into relations with other forces life struggles with
5161554 let us recall nietzsches idea of the eternal return as a little ditty a
5161555 considers the notion of thing as synonymous with substance and foundation disregarding the neutral dimension which is implicit in the notion of thing
5161556 the thing that feels with immediacy and evidence is not the body but the mind
5161557 one would be tempted to claim against descartes the rights of the body considering it the bearer of a stronger and more vivid sensitive evidence than the intellectual one
5161558 opaque indeterminate and open which is not self evident and is not a machine
5161559 it is not i it is not you that feels but those hats and clothes casually mentioned by descartes
5161560 toward a complete exteriority in which everything is surface skin fabric
5161561 before treating power as a matter of will he treated it as a matter of feeling and sensibility
5161562 but as nietzsche often says we would need another sensibility another way of feeling
5161563 the possibility of transmutation as a new way of feeling thinking and above all being the overman
5161564 the remaining anthropomorphism in this text should be corrected by the nietzschean principle that there is a subjectivity of the universe which is no longer anthropomorphic but cosmic
5161565 to admit that there are perceptions in the inorganic world
5161566 the fundamental confirmation of the inorganic orientation of architectural experience the rejection of functionalism the critical revision of the fundamentals of architecture the often indeterminate porous aspect of interiors of buildings that lack any clear delimitation the privileging of a public building topology destined for transit performances cultural tourism the dissolution of housing units attention to spaces of transit rather than residences are similar aspects of a tendency oriented toward the abandonment of any organic character
5161567 emotional rapidity capable of unleashing a neutral and abstract excitement
5161568 are a kind of happening represented by things rather than people installations must not be considered the object of a visitors evaluation it is the installation that feels the visitor welcomes him touches him feels him up one does not go to exhibitions to see and enjoy art but to be seen and enjoyed by art
5161569 the french are too human too historical too concerned with the future and the past
5161570 to be fully a part of the crowd and at the same time completely outside it removed from it
5161571 not only does art not wait for human beings to begin but we may ask if art ever appears among human beings except under artificial and belated conditions
5161572 unable to judge whether he was being condemned for what he did yesterday or being offered a sexual invitation or just what was meant
5161573 anxious and withdraw ing if the child responds to her as a loving mother
5161574 go to bed youre very tired and i want you to get your sleep
5161575 lets stop right now im tired and at my wits end
5161576 get out of my sight because im sick of you
5161577 it was not clear for many years even to gregory that his disparate elegantly crafted and argued essays the steps of this title were about a single subject an ecology of mind
5161578 scholarly analysis of the work of gregory bateson is only a fraction of the task it is more important now to respond sem xiv this foreword written in 1999 might as well have been written in the 1970s considering the response from deleuze and guattari
5161579 the gap between newtonian world of objects and the communicational word of contexts
5161580 an ultimate synthesis will be achieved to combine the newtonian and communicational worlds
5161581 the wolf man knew that freud would soon declare him cured but that it was not at all the case and his treatment would continue for all eternity under brunswick lacan leclaire
5161582 all communication has this characteristic it can be magically modified by accompanying communication it is this modulation which is music
5161583 activity is commonly valued for itself rather than aimed at some deferred goal
5161584 the balinese extend to human relationships attitudes based upon bodily balance and generalize the idea that motion is essential to balance
5161585 there is a schizophrenic taste for the tool that moves it away from work and toward free action a schizophrenic taste for the weapon that turns it into a means for peace
5161586 each plateau can be read starting anywhere and can be related to any other plateau
5161587 aufgrund der erkenntnisse der hirnforschung anschaulich pr sentiert durch farbige hirnbilder werden spektakul re m glichkeiten in aussicht gestellt die kaum realisierbar sind

5161594 as journalists were good at finding great sources of information and distinguishing whats important but we also want to harness the very significant capabilities of our community
5161595 it only takes a very small percentage of people being active in a topic for it to be really vibrant and valuable for everybody else
5161596 ordinary social media are too broad to draw ads but we can sell display ads reaching a specific audience on electronics or cars or medical devices
5161597 to the famous positivity of the negative nietzsche opposes his own discovery the negativity of the positive
5161598 why should we not risk the act of taking from behind deleuze himself and engage in the practice of the
5161599 deleuzian philosophy affirms while hegelian philosophy negates malabou and zizek are on to something let me here as one of the those readers detail a more substantive account of deleuzes relationship to hegel
5161600 we will misunderstand the whole of nietzsches work if we do not see against whom its principle concepts are directed
5161601 it has been said that nietzsche did not know his hegel
5161602 has served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest adversely affecting the ability of scholars and journalists to publish their work
5161603 adrian was nominated because of the work he had done to raise awareness of bone marrow transplants and his nomination is a recognition of that hard work
5161604 wlgs financial and operating results continue to improve period to period all of us at wlg are very pleased with our results for the first six months of 2008 but we are also mindful of the current economic conditions around the world particularly rising fuel prices and the possibility of a slow down in demand for our services we are watching these issues carefully and will do so for the remainder of 2008 at wlg we continue to make investments in our infrastructure including expending funds and incurring management time to integrate our recent acquisitions with the groups existing operations other projects are underway on a number of fronts we are working to upgrade our it technology as well as to transition the operations of wcs to the common technology platform used by the wlg group while these efforts require cash we are confident that they will pay dividends in the future through greater efficiencies and enhanced profits we opened a new warehouse in the first quarter of 2008 that doubled our capacity in the uk and are making improvements and adding new customers to maximize the benefits to us of this new facility this new warehouse complements the warehouse we opened in melbourne australia in 2007 adding this new warehouse capacity is in response to the increasing demand on the part of our customers for us to expand our offering of value added services we will continue to look for other opportunities to provide value added services in all of our locations with all of the initiatives underway and the accomplishments of this past six months i want to again emphasize that our operating objectives remain the same in short all of us at wlg are committed to providing high quality and personalized services on an international scale at competitive prices and our financial goals are equally clear simply stated these are to increase our revenues improve our profitability and create value for our shareholders
5161605 i like wine but i can only see it as something to accompany food i cant get excited about it on its own
5161606 redistribute wealth from those who have the most to those who have the least
5161607 weve looked at large portion sizes almost entirely in terms of whether its healthy for us and now we have to consider is that sort of a demand going to be sustainable
5161608 from the place of my firmest conviction as it were in the heart of the deleuzian crowd or pack
5161609 we will misunderstand the whole of nietzsches work if we do not see against whom its principle concepts are directed
5161610 an uncovering of the network or dynamic of the conflict a
5161611 it is simultaneously through contraction that we are habits but through contemplation that we contract
5161612 one is struck by the fact that in the pn hegel develops a problematic of habit that is very close to that of deleuze
5161613 i have tried to read deleuzes relation to hegel as symptomatic
5161614 why should you get a place to go when the rest of us dont
5161615 this terrible attack and other violent attacks against journalists have created a climate of fear
5161616 a number of journalists who criticized government officials in the course of their work were subjected to criminal prosecution and or civil lawsuits some resulting in prison sentences and large fines journalists were also subject to harassment threats and acts of physical violence that appeared to be connected to their criticism of the government or specific public officials
5161617 particularly of individuals considered by the government to be political opponents
5161618 for civil society and an independent media the freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly are oxygen
5161619 the government of azerbaijan is trying to incapacitate the opposition press and instil fear in journalists before the upcoming presidential elections
5161620 the government has been trying to silence azadlig for years employees of the newspaper have faced beatings different civil charges and other pressures but neither the newspaper nor its coverage will change
5161621 the leading jailer of journalists in europe and central asia
5161622 naxcivan is a place where brutality against journalists happens very often
5161623 it is considered a region without rights there are no rights respected there the law is not applied there is no freedom of expression
5161624 i think their main goal is to force us independent journalists out of naxcivan
5161625 while they were searching our apartment the police told us we will succeed in silencing you you will have to leave the region i think this process is related to our professional activities here
5161626 there is no repression in naxcivan against journalists there is a struggle against those who use their position as journalists to break the law
5161627 the correspondent from rfe rl was arrested not because he was a journalist but because he interfered with plans to demolish this market and beautify the city and for interfering with police officers who were trying to establish order
5161628 we hear a lot about arbitrariness on the part of the authorities but this is nothing compared to what is happening in naxcivan
5161629 tea houses are being destroyed in the regions villages despite protests from the people other strange things are happening in naxcivan the authorities are destroying the ovens people use to bake bread in their homes because they say this harms the environment they are forcing people to buy bread from shops owned by the state monopoly
5161630 azerbaijan really got the first most corrupt country listing but the government bribed someone to move them down to number three
5161631 this will be an account separate from the regular budget strictly for oil revenue with the limit that only dividends from the fund may be tapped during a one year period
5161632 marred by numerous serious irregularities and lack of transparency in the vote counting process
5161633 the election officials did everything they could think of to keep us away from the counting tables they told me to go out to dinner go for a walk out for a smoke and they seated us far away from the actual counting tables and the ballots but when i asked or rather demanded to be close enough to actually see the other observers gained courage and we all came across the hall to the tables the electricity failed twice but everyone had cigarette lighters so we held them up and watched as the officials pulled ballots from under the tables and switched them with those on the table only after that did the chairman start the vote count
5161634 does not function independently of the executive branch and is corrupt and inefficient
5161635 because of the level of corruption in the ministry of health reforms needed to advance our work from humanitarian assistance to meaningful development can not happen
5161636 to make money doctors may prefer abortions versus issuing oral contraceptives
5161637 we need to change the laws to discourage bribe taking and decrease the level of dependence the people have come to expect from their government and if some company is chosen for a government project we will list all the reasons for our choice to make bids transparent
5161638 all his words are nice yes but why when they were in power before did they not do these things
5161639 in 1992 to 1993 things were horrible the streets were so unsafe that you would not dare to walk about after dark only when our current president took power did things settle down he stopped the war with armenia and took control of our streets
5161640 caucasus and middle east countries as potential partners in the process of forming regional security system
5161641 on procedure of settling issues related to withdrawal of a soviet republic from the ussr
5161642 if armenians residing in nagorno karabakh want to decide their fate they must do it basing on the principle of azerbaijans territorial integrity but if they do not want to do this they must leave nagorno karabakh and create their second state in another place
5161643 in the contemporary world the transition of power from one member of a family to another in itself isnt considered as an antidemocratic fact
5161644 moreover id like to mention that the true heir of heydar aliyev is my younger son heydar aliyev the youngest member of our family

5161647 for the past 10 15 days agil had been receiving phone calls from people threatening him or attempting to blackmail him
5161648 he was also being followed he told us after he was attacked that he recognized one of the assailants
5161649 this terrible attack and other violent attacks against journalists have created a climate of fear in an apparent effort to silence critical voices in azerbaijan
5161650 the stabbing of a journalist is another provocation against azerbaijan and was intended to create a myth regarding the problems of freedom of speech and press in the country
5161651 we have every reason to suspect that the incident was contrived from the outset with the sole aim of silencing an opposition journalist
5161652 says a lot about how authorities plan to approach the presidential election
5161653 khojalu was located in an important strategic position losing control over khojalu would mean a political fiasco for moutalibov
5161654 the corridor by which people could leave was reserved by armenians
5161655 it was obvious shooting the khojalu people was organized by somebody for removing the power in azerbaijan
5161656 we knew the corridor was left for the exit of the peaceful people
5161657 however the armenians had left a corridor for the escape of the people
5161658 it was obvious the some people had organized the shooting for shifting the power in azerbaijan
5161659 chingiz dont tell anyone that you think something is wrong because theyll kill you
5161660 former leadership of azerbaijan was also at fault of the khojalu events
5161661 the bloodshed will do good to us we shouldnt interfere in the course of events
5161662 it is impossible not to admit that if the national front of azerbaijan in fact had defined far reaching goals it succeeded in addressing them
5161663 on february 25 i again received information about the preparations of the attack
5161664 we knew the corridor was left for the civilian population to leave
5161665 destruction of azerbaijani monuments in armenia and especially in zangezur and in the safe haven
5161666 history of azerbaijani genocide perpetrated by armenians in 1918 20
5161667 20 of the azerbaijani republic is still occupied by armenians nothing and no one is forgotten this land is calling for its only patriotic generation us
5161668 russian military unit 366 headed by armenian and russian commanders
5161669 two days later they showed the dead bodies were tortured if aghdam was under the control of azerbaijanis and the reporters could freely make pictures there it means the armenian forces had nothing to do with the crime
5161670 many things are just made up which causes harm to the image of our nation
5161671 caucasus and middle east countries as potential partners in the process of forming regional security system
5161672 on procedure of settling issues related to withdrawal of a soviet republic from the ussr
5161673 if armenians residing in nagorno karabakh want to decide their fate they must do it basing on the principle of azerbaijans territorial integrity but if they do not want to do this they must leave nagorno karabakh and create their second state in another place

5161678 a terrorist who plants an explosive device gets 10 years in prison but will end up being released after three or four years this hurts the motivation in the shin bet
5161679 you have to hear the responses inside the shin bet to the release they work day and night to capture and neutralize terrorists and all of it is gone in an instant
5161680 a terrorist who plants an explosive device gets 10 years in prison but will end up being released after three or four years this hurts the motivation in the shin bet
5161681 the government realized it could not do a southern hostage deal so it went
5161682 hamas is demanding 450 heavyweight prisoners who took part in recent terrorist attacks the memories of the victims families are still very raw i dont believe the government can go ahead with this
5161683 on the morning after the release we heard fatah blaming israel whatever happens they will blame israel and fault everyone except for themselves
5161684 the aim of the release is also to show the americans and europeans that we are open minded and that we are helping out the side that we are supposed to be helping
5161685 in the short term this is not a risk the aksa martyrs brigades have been neutralized by the pa for the time being
5161686 but what many in israel do not realize is that while these terrorists may not go back to fighting many will go back to indoctrinating others into terrorism and creating a terror supporting environment
5161687 some will recruit on campuses others will become so called journalists while others will be integrated into institutions or sent abroad these jobs are meant to compensate them for the alleged suffering they underwent in prisons in israel

5161783 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century

5161795 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5161797 all the elements sink their individual identities in what became a prolonged meditation on art and life space time perception and the nature of reality itself a crossroad for western painting where the classic outward looking predominantly representational art of the past met the provisional internalised and self referential ethos of the future

5161811 adapting to local business practice is never easy no matter where you are however japan and korea have especially complex cultures and so are even more of a challenge for european businesses

5161813 it is a very serious problem and it has led to a whole host of additional problems in the marketplace
5161814 its definitely a vehicle that has and can be used by those who effectively want to push the price of the stock down and do it rapidly
5161815 an extension to every stock is going to begin to make trading in all securities more cumbersome and more expensive

5161819 tayangan di televisi jelas mempengaruhi perilaku anak berbagai penelitian menunjukkan bahwa fase anak anak adalah fase meniru tak heran bila anak anak sering disebut imitator ulung selain tontonan televisi anak juga perlu dijaga agar mengurangi bermain video game video game menurut para ahli menawarkan agresi lebih kuat pada anak anak dibandingkan tontonan di tv karena jauh lebih hidup dan bersifat interaktif bukan sekadar observasi seperti televisi
5161820 media itu harus ramah pada keluarga pada anak pada ibu dan pada seluruh komponen anak bangsa jangan sampai media justru menyebarkan virus degradasi bagi pembangunan karakter anak bangsa ini
5161821 sebagai seorang ibu dengan tiga anak yhang masih kecil kecil saya sungguh prihatin dengan tayangan televisi saat ini saya geram pada insan televisi yang tidak peduli anak dan keluarga komisi penyiaran indonesia mestinya tegas menindak stasiun televisi yang menyebarkan kekerasan seks dan mistik itu kalau bisa dicabut izin siarannya
5161822 orang tua jangan terkecoh dengan hanya menyensor adegan seksual misalnya ciuman adegan kekerasan mulai tembakan tamparan pipi jerit dan teriakan darah gebuk gebukan perlu juga disensor
5161823 saya sangat appreciate dengan langkah pemerintah melalui menkominfo yang melakukan pemblokiran terhadap situs situs porno di indonesia karena tidak jarang juga anak anak mengakses situs yang merusak generasi muda kita itu
5161824 dalam pilgub ini kami tidak melihat dari partai pendukungnya tetapi kami melihatnya dari sosoknya
5161825 tutur saidi tokoh masyarakat bekasi yang juga turut memprakarsai pertemuan warga jabar pro hade tersebut
5161826 apalagi sosok pak ahmad heryawan adalah seorang yang mengerti dan berpengalaman tentang seluk beluk birokrasi beliau juga seorang ulama pemimpin umat mengerti dan mengayomi kami yang sangat mengharap ada perubahan besar bagi rakyat jabar
5161827 saya ingin putera sukabumi asli tampil memimpin jawa barat bagi kami warga asal sukabumi ini merupakan sebuah kebanggaan tersendiri
5161828 melihat dukungan yang spontan ini saya semakin percaya diri bahwa hade akan memenangkan pilgub jabar nanti ini berdasarkan pada pertimbangan selain kawasan bodetabek merupakan kantong kantong utama pks juga merupakan wilayah yang padat penduduknya
5161829 dukungan kepada kami terus mengalir saya patut mensyukurinya berbagai kalangan masyarakat banyak datang kepada kami dan siap mencoblos dan ikut memenangkan pasangan hade
5161830 dukungan yang diberikan kepada pasangan hade benar benar keluar dari hati nurani terdalam mereka yang datang memberikan dukungan kepada kami itu bahkan siap menyumbang atribut sekian spanduk sekian dan lain lain subhaanallah
5161831 perlu ada penguatan regulasi dari pemerintah daerah agar mereka bisa bertahan menjelang era globalisasi mendatang dimana persaingan usaha pun akan sangat bebas
5161832 pemimpin selalu melupakan keberadaan pondok pesantren sehingga diharapkan pemimpin kedepan bisa lebih perduli dengan kami
5161833 mungkin karena belum ada pemimpin negara yang lahir dari didikan pondok pesantren
5161834 kami dari 16 elemen buruh yang terdiri antara lain spn fspmi gaspermindo kbb paguyuban spsi ilf foswan formatap forum puskom fkk ptdi forsil sp bumn sp farkes ppmi dll menyatakan mendukung pasangan hade kami yakin hade mampu memperjuangkan hak hak buruh yang selama ini dikebiri
5161835 pungli masih menjadi keluhan utama pengusaha yang menyebabkan ekonomi biaya tinggi yang itu justru berdampak pada rendahnya upah buruh padahal bila pelayanan birokrasi steril dari tindakan pungli maka pengusaha juga tidak akan segan segan menaikkan kesejahteraan kaum pekerja
5161836 perwakilan gerilyawan hade tersebar di seluruh jawa barat bahkan di tasik ada gerilyawan yang mewakafkan warung makannya menjadi posko gerilyawan hade bagi gerilyawan yang mampir di warung makannya dijamin gratis
5161837 dengan potensi alam dan sumber daya manusia yang luar biasa besar ini mengapa rakyat jawa barat masih saja tak kunjung beranjak dari keterpurukannya mulai dari tingginya angka kemiskinan pengangguran sampai tingginya angka drop out ini berarti ada yang salah dalam pengelolalan pemerintahan yang selama ini dijalankan
5161838 selain itu perlu diciptakan iklim investasi yang kondusif pemberdayaan ekonomi rakyat dan penciptaan kesempatan kerja yang luas dan membangun sistem perlindungan lingkungan hidup yang efektif dan seimbang
5161839 daerah daerah perkotaan jawa barat juga menghadapi permasalahan khas perkotaan seperti kemiskinan kota daerah daerah kumuh penurunan kualitas hubungan sosial kriminalitas prostitusi anak jalanan kekerasan oleh siswa siswa sekolah meningkatnya penyalahgunaan obat obat terlarang hingga penyebaran hiv aids
5161840 target ini saya kira sangat realistis mengingat persaingan yang cukup ketat diantara sesama kandidat pasangan gubernur
5161841 masa depan hanya bisa diraih oleh mereka yang menguasai sains dan tehnologi kegemilangan peradaban umat selama tujuh abad berturut turut karena pencapaian sains yang sungguh luar biasa sebaliknya krisis multidimensi yang dialami bangsa ini karena kita tidak cukup menguasai ilmu dan tehnologi serta lemah karakter
5161842 saya bersyukur harga harga kebutuhan pokok mulai stabil terutama minyak goreng waktu berkunjung ke bogor beberapa hari lalu saya juga mengusulkan agar ada operasi pasar mudah mudahan gejolak harga ini tidak terjadi lagi
5161843 selama ini masyarakat yang tinggal di pelosok tidak mampu menjangkau puskesmas yang biasanya terletak di pusat kecamatan akibat tidak tersedia sarana transportasi yang memadai ataupun tidak adanya biaya transportasi menuju puskesmas terdekat
5161844 konsolidasi nasional ini kami lakukan untuk memberi dukungan penuh kepada pasangan hade yang kita yakini sepenuhnya mampu memberikan arah baru bagi perubahan mendasar dan signifikan di jawa barat
5161845 pks mengharapkan pemilihan gubernur jawa barat menghasilkan proses demokrasi yang bersih adil dan transparan tanpa ada kecurangan dan tidak diciderai oleh tindakan tindakan yang anti demokrasi
5161846 karena itu kepada seluruh kader dan simpatisan pks di jawa barat saya menghimbau agar mengoptimalkan seluruh tenaga pikiran dan dana untuk berjihad bagi kemenangan pasangan hade
5161847 keduanya akan bersinergi mengusung harapan baru dan mengabdi secara total bagi kesejahteraan dan kemakmuran masyarakat jawa barat
5161848 terjadinya banjir di musim hujan dan kekeringan di musim kemarau adalah bukti bahwa kondisi hutan kita sudah sangat memprihatinkan hutan di jabar banyak yang rusak akibat illaegal logging harus ada langkah tegas dari pemprov agar hutan kita terselamatkan
5161849 sebagian besar hutan lindung di lereng tebing dan puncak gunung digunduli lahan di pegunungan itu beralih fungsi menjadi perkebunan villa resort dan tempat wisata karena itu aparat penegak hukum harus tegas menindak mereka yang melanggar
5161850 bencana akibat kerusakan hutan berdampak jangka panjang bahkan bisa memunculkan bencana ekologis yang tak berkesudahan
5161851 kami lihat hanya pasangan hade yang mau dan tulus berkomitmen dengan spn terbukti dengan sejarah spn pks yang konsisten dan berada di garis terdepan dalam membela hak hak buruh selama ini di indonesia tidak saja di kabupaten bandung tetapi kiprahnya juga terlihat di tingkat pusat
5161852 demikian jauh jangkauan visi rasulullah kata heryawan sehingga banyak orientalis menyebut rasulullah sebagai tokoh yang paling berpengaruh dalam sejarah
5161853 kabupaten bogor itu sangat luas kawasannya banyak perbukitan antara satu desa dengan desa lainnya cukup jauh masyarakat di jasinga misalnya harus berjam jam untuk menjangkau birokrasi pemkab bogor di cibinong
5161854 ada sedikit cerita menarik ketika kami harus keliling memperkenalkan hade di wilayah pasangan lain kami pernah ditolak pernah dilaporkan ke panwas pernah dicuekin pernah dimarahin diplototin dll tapi alhamdulillah banyak sekali yang memberikan sambutan dengan senyum manis mempersilahkan duduk sambil minum teh karena tekad kami bulat kota bogor hade insya allah menang
5161855 berikutnya terkenang sekali waktu kami kehabisan stiker hade kami download dari web hadepisan kami fotocopy sebanyak banyaknya kemudian ditempel dengan tepung terigu menyusuri kampung kampung sambil memperkenalkan dan menempel dengan terigu baru setengah perjalanan hujan deras kami lihat tempelan stiker kertas sebagian lepas tapi kami tidak putus asa terus kami tempel lagi terus dan terus bersama allah kenalkan hade ke masyarakat insya allah menang
5161856 untuk sementara ini kami hanya ingin pka heryawan dan dede yusuf membantu kami agar pemkab segera merenovasi pasar bojong yang cukup memperihatinkan disamping itu hade harus lebih perhatian pada orang orang kecil
5161857 secara pribadi saya akan menyampaikan aspirasi ini kepada bupati bekasi agar pasar bojong bisa segera dibangun
5161858 kebiasaan petani kita bercocok tanam harus diubah intensifikasi proses pertanian harus dilakukan dengan mengoptimalkan ilmu pengetahuan dan tehnologi pertanian yang benar insya allah bila cara bertani kita mengikuti cara bertani petani jepang impian petani jadi kaya dan bisa naik haji mudah digapai karena di jepang produksi padi 9 13 ton sementara petani kita hanya 4 6 ton per hektar padahal tanah jawa barat jauh lebih subur ketimbang di jepang berarti ada yang salah dengan cara bertani kita yang diterapkan selama ini
5161859 aura kemenangan sudah terasa ketika memasuki kota bandung sejarah telah membuktikan bahwa soekarno presiden ri yang pertama telah memelopori perjuangan dari bandung pada usia 29 tahun kepeloporan para pemuda ini akan membangkitkan semangat baru untuk mengusung kemenangan reformasi
5161860 saya menginstruksikan agar seluruh kader dan simpatisan pan untuk allout dalam memenangkan pasangan hade

5161883 this result was driven by strong global demand and improved spreads particularly in export markets where higher global steel prices offset rising raw material costs
5161884 our asian businesses particularly thailand where economic conditions continue to improve are producing consistent results
5161885 in the next five years theres no reason why demand cant stay strong due to bric brazil russia india china economies
5161886 in china there may well be some slower growth but demand for steel continues to very strong and weve still got russia and india going flat out

5161896 this years report card shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5161897 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination can you imagine the public uproar if mental health was replaced with race gender or religion
5161898 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5161899 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5161900 these findings indicate that the worrying trend of have and have not patients continues
5161901 ensuring canadians have access to a family physician is a key area for action
5161902 the uncertainty of canadians is a direct reflection the lack of leadership in health demonstrated by our politicians
5161903 funding has been returned to the system but canadians are still waiting for a renewed vision that will ensure the sustainability of the system

5161936 a gm executive was required to watch each of the dream cars get cut into pieces and crushed
5161937 the gm exec took the lasalle roadster and biscayne to the junkyard and he figured the guys at the junkyard would finish the job properly so he took off early to go christmas shopping the junkyard workers never crushed the lasalle instead leaving it in many pieces
5161938 i had to dig pieces out of the ground the body of the car was fiberglass so it didnt oxidize but other remaining parts were almost hopeless the body had to be glued back together from all the bits and pieces it was like resurrecting a dinosaur
5161939 ive been doing this since 78 being a treasure hunter and restoring concept cars these cars are a treat for the eyes and a study in history and im excited to bring several of these gems to pebble beach
5161940 these and other historical treasures from motorama demonstrate the forward thinking that led gm to the front of the pack
5161941 joe bortz has somehow managed to rescue and resurrect concept cars from that era allowing us to see the sometimes radical gm designs that influenced industry styling for decades
5161942 these motorama cars fit perfectly with pebble beachs history of showing only the rarest vehicles and they allow us to emphasize the importance of preserving our automotive history
5161943 one of the most desirable and beautiful concept cars of all time
5161944 it was called the miracle car inside general motors because it drew the largest crowds of any of the concepts shown in motorama
5161945 pebble beach will be the first time the biscayne will be shown publicly since 1955 since the windows werent flat we had to create a wraparound windshield and the door mechanisms are made with the help of swiss clockmakers its not fully restored its still a work in progress

5161957 its good for the environment its good for peoples pocketbooks in the long run its just good overall
5161958 its easy to be short sighted and not think about the long term savings if you dont have a lot of money
5161959 if you can pay monthly that makes it a lot easier
5161960 they have the investment money that we just dont have
5161961 if our negotiations work out we could install 10 000 systems within a few years
5161962 setting up the billing system is expensive so if the company had to do the billing on its own that would break it
5161963 in our current budget situation we cannot afford to be overstaffed
5161964 we will make those adjustments quickly with the least amount of disruption
5161965 as a result were getting hit more than the rest of the district
5161966 certainly winning is the best antidote for any sports business
5161967 before when there were a lot of people here it was for boston and new york and they were all red sox and yankees fans
5161968 were going to get pretty darn close to 2 million
5161969 and that makes a lot more open to the idea for a new park
5161970 thats only going to improve if our season ticket base grows
5161971 the fact were not selling those like hotcakes tells you were not where we want to be
5161972 the concerts have taken crowds from the mid 20s to the mid 30s
5161973 weve been through so many hurricanes this has become a way of life
5161974 its going to be hard for people to imagine that a storm is on the way
5161975 i look at my neighbors and nothing is taken in
5161976 there are various weather patterns in the gulf of mexico the caribbean and the u s
5161977 all of those together are what direct a hurricane to go one place or another
5161978 thats going to be a pretty big factor as to how fast it strengthens and how much
5161979 if it holds together pretty well over cuba and strengthens pretty quickly it could make it to a category 2
5161980 the bush administration must work with congress to find a bipartisan solution
5161981 defendant offers no persuasive reason to reach a contrary result here
5161982 violation of the peace agreement and a challenge to progress in mindanao
5161983 because of these sneaky attacks as commander in chief i have ordered the afp and pnp to defend every inch of philippine territory against milf forces and immediately restore peace in affected areas in lanao del norte
5161984 not tolerate and would not crush any attempt to disturb the peace and development in mindanao
5161985 to assess the situation in lanao and other areas in mindanao and come up with concrete firm and decisive action
5161986 i assure our people that the government will defend them at all cost from any move that will disrupt the aspiration for genuine and lasting peace
5161987 i cant tell you how excited i am about this
5161988 this statement seems to show that cms is finally making the connection between its misguided directive and the real kids it could hurt
5161989 the reality is the bush administration should not be applauded because nothing has changed through this directive they are still committed to denying childrens access to health care
5161990 the only appropriate response is for cms to formally rescind the august 17th directive
5161991 most states believe that if cms wants to make a change they should issue regulations or seek legislation
5161992 there has been a lot of shifting in this track and there is still a lot of uncertainty
5161993 right now we dont think conditions will be favorable for rapid strengthening
5161994 im going down the interstate right now and my wife is way far into labor and i dont think i can make it where i need to go

5162003 means of reaching those who have committed crimes in the combat zone military people whose crimes go undetected until after they have left the service
5162004 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5162005 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5162006 he can only get a fair shake if those civilians are honorably discharged marines who fought
5162007 soccer moms and pops cant understand the horrors of war or the complex set of rules of engagement that these marines face
5162008 id love for my guy to be tried by civilians

5162021 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5162022 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5162023 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5162024 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5162025 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5162026 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5162027 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars
5162028 its not you its me who isnt good enough for you
5162029 dieser punkt ist in meinen augen nicht verhandelbar er muss alle russischen streitkr fte betreffen die seit dem 7 august nach georgien gekommen sind
5162030 ich bekomme mehr und mehr das gef hl dass der alt bundeskanzler ein gest rtes verh ltnis zu seiner fr heren bet tigung hat sobald russland ins spiel kommt ist sein urteil in h chstem ma e unverh ltnism ig und unangemessen
5162031 schr der ist mittlerweile die prominenteste stimme moskaus in deutschland
5162032 eine einseitige schuldzuweisung frei nach dem motto wes brot ich ess des lied ich sing dem altkanzler ist offenbar die au enpolitische weitsicht abhandengekommen
5162033 er schw cht die position des westens und erweist der sache der menschenrechte und des v lkerrechts einen b rendienst wer f r gazprom arbeitet sollte k nftig bei themen die russland betreffen besser schweigen
5162034 die strategische partnerschaft zwischen deutschland und russland muss gr ndlich berpr ft werden sie stammt noch aus zeiten von rot gr n durch die gro machtpolitik moskaus ist eine neue lage entstanden
5162035 das kann europa nicht tatenlos hinnehmen den russen muss gesagt werden so darf man sich nicht auff hren
5162036 pokoknya kita akan panggil secepatnya untuk mengklarifikasi dan menentukan sikap
5162037 well you have to have a date to go out with otherwise you are just going out with yourself
5162038 weve successfully enticed the calf to deeper waters between broken bay and west head barrenjoey
5162039 over the next little while well experiment to try to separate it from the yacht
5162040 most likely it will move around the entrance to broken bay and in the next few days will strand itself on a sandbar or beach itself
5162041 there is a slim chance it might move out to sea but we cant predict exactly what might happen
5162042 it is only one to two months old and would not have been weaned yet from its mother
5162043 it cant be fed and in fact we wouldnt know what to feed it
5162044 you have an enormous amount of material and you have to distill it to a syrup by the end of the day so much of it is a hewing process chipping away at things that arent the point or arent the story or arent the intention really its that last couple of drops youre distilling that makes all the difference it isnt that hard to get a ton of corn into a gallon of sour mash but to get that gallon of sour mash down to that one shot of pure whiskey takes patience
5162045 i was in that place a few weeks ago it was awful
5162046 the roar of the grease the smell of the crowd
5162047 its more emotional because theres so many memories and things
5162048 you just hope and you just feel awful when something is taken from you
5162049 sometimes maybe i put off making decisions that maybe i should have taken earlier
5162050 to make decisions in the long term interests of the country you have to take quite tough decisions quite early on so that you can get things done within the life of a parliament
5162051 you appoint good people and trust their decisions but you have to know when to step in william hague has helped me because he made all the mistakes the first time round
5162052 if wed have had that election gordon brown would no longer have been prime minister and the conservatives would be the largest party in a hung parliament
5162053 brown compounded calling off the election by then saying it was nothing to do with the polls which was a massive mistake it was a lie and it was treating people like fools
5162054 it was a big roll of the dice no autocue no funny business there was a moment when i lost my train of thought but no one really noticed
5162055 perhaps more embarrassing to prudently financial new labour are the ranks of tramps and malingerers who have escaped into ashworth to avoid working for a living demanding and receiving full board and full benefits of 100 per week pocket money for life we prison transfers receive only 25 being regarded as patients only for restrictions
5162056 cataracts ive had for 10 years are untreated as my visiting an outside hospital would again draw unwanted attention
5162057 quality background havent exercised in the open air since 1975 stopped all social visits since 1998 when ashworth became less than a prison confined to ward for past 23 years force fed since 1999
5162058 in like fashion new labour exploits the threat of a few fertiliser bombs to panic and heard a bovine generation
5162059 as a child i watched german planes daily nightly bomb glasgow back to full employment new labour has accomplished more permanent diminution of human civil liberties than ww2 bombs and rockets
5162060 new labours disregard for human civil rights is now a general contagion with each infliction coated in a syrup of entirely cosmetic safeguards
5162061 i think hes nice and i think hes sincere in what he says
5162062 im probably the only person in this town that does
5162063 mccain will have problems getting a high turnout among those voters unless he finds some way to identify with them some way to make them think that a hes not connected to bush and b his economic plan is superior to obamas
5162064 john mccain continues to hear the concerns of rural families thats why he has made every effort to engage these voters on his plans to create jobs and provide relief for working families
5162065 were getting a great response in rural communities that have been ignored by washington and left behind in the bush economy
5162066 so if youre such a marketing expert and you help people attract all the clients they need what are you doing here at a networking group each week
5162067 if youre so good why are you so available let alone chasing business
5162068 i market consistently because i know that if you dont market consistently you dont always have clients even when i have a waiting list of people waiting to work with me i still dont stop marketing id be foolish to do that
5162069 two clients recently graduated so i have openings for just two new clients
5162070 i have decided to take on more clients because tell the truth
5162071 this is what i charge take it or leave it
5162072 i dont make enough mo ney to hire an assistant yet not right now
5162073 i will refuse to go back to a regular school
5162074 one of the consequences of being here is theyre missing out on the social structure and the activities of their regular schools
5162075 theres no getting left behind in a class of 20 or 22
5162076 youre educating a broad spectrum of kids on a lot of topics the teachers have to be well rounded

5162082 3 essential oils lavender bergamot and tea tree can possibly kill mrsa bug and staph infection but scientists cannot patent a natural occurring ingredient and therefore they wouldnt make much selling it or advertising it so they dont bother

5162087 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5162088 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5162089 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5162090 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5162091 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5162092 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5162093 its hard to change the perception that its only for masculine looking big muscled females i hope to change that image weightlifters can be attractive and feminine as well as successful

5162095 after my freshman year i decided to give it a go i picked it up pretty quickly my coach entered me for a competition and took me to the olympic training center that summer for fun i was hooked and decided to train full time
5162096 my first goal was to get enough recognition to be invited to the olympic training center
5162097 it works really well for me and hes a fantastic motivator
5162098 regular chiropractic treatments a balanced diet and plenty of sleep help with recovery
5162099 im doing something not done by too many women in the world im lifting more than my own body weight above my head
5162100 my coach is confident ill do well i hope to make the 2009 world championship u s team as well
5162101 we know one another from competitions and everyones very encouraging ive made some really close friends on competition days friendships are put on hold while we focus on winning then we return to normal
5162102 coach morris oversees all the athletes at the olympic training center
5162103 but ill be able to stay in touch with coach mcvey hes done so much for me as a lifter and as a person
5162104 ive always been fascinated by the olympics and what they represent getting a chance to train for them is a dream come true
5162105 weightliftings a great sport i hope i can encourage and inspire other young women the way tara nott and others inspire me its enabled me to grow in self confidence and given me opportunities to follow my dreams
5162106 73 of companies currently leveraging or planning to leverage internal facing web 2 0 solutions are pressured by the need to improve knowledge sharing within the organization
5162107 what they are claiming to be bigfoot in a photograph doesnt look natural
5162108 when the photo is juxtaposed next to an off the shelf costume the resemblance is remarkable
5162109 so here these men are in georgia which is home to the world renowned yerkes primate center and what do they do they turn to a charlatan instead
5162110 much of the lore of bigfoot i suspect is what one eminent folklorist a generation ago called fakelore invented figures with little or no basis in actual oral tradition that are passed off as local folklore figures like paul bunyan and pecos bill for purposes of pr attracting tourists selling tabloid newspapers and magazines creating childrens literature etc
5162111 crackpots and eggheads pseudoscience and the search for the yeti
5162112 long history of secretively held bigfoot bodies that goes back to the 1960s
5162113 and until a reputable museum laboratory or university finds incontrovertible documented physical evidence for bigfoot then we should assume these other finds are fakes and in the category of the alien autopsy of the 90s
5162114 my assessment of the evidence suggests that bigfoot is a great ape like a gorilla or chimp which is not a hominid and does not possess material culture or the ability to control fire
5162115 ive concluded based on repeated examination of the film that it shows a real animal and not a man in a fur suit

5162117 legends about monsters in general probably address peoples abiding fear of and therefore fascination with the unknown
5162118 we can see little flashpoints in gas prices or a spike in joblessness but getting the whole picture is extremely difficult in part because were depending on government collected data which could often be three months later

5162139 iraqi shiite assassination teams are being trained in at least four locations in iran by tehrans elite quds force and lebanese hezbollah
5162140 and are planning to return to iraq in the next few months to kill specific iraqi officials as well as u s and iraqi troops according to intelligence gleaned from captured militia fighters and other sources in iraq
5162141 provided iraqs national security adviser with several lists of the assassination teams expected targets
5162142 said the targets include many judges but would not otherwise identify them
5162143 iraqs intelligence service is preparing operations to determine where and when the special group fighters will enter the country and is to provide an assessment to prime minister nouri al maliki

5162149 we are being told the anti missile defense system is targeted against something that does not exist doesnt it seem funny to you to say the least

5162157 the market alone cannot solve our health care woes in part because the market has proven incapable of creating large enough insurance pools to keep costs to individuals affordable in part because health care is not like other products or services when your child gets sick you dont go shopping for the best bargain
5162158 coercion and the use of state power to mandate care coverage or costs
5162159 threat to our future health is just as significant as the current security threat

5162186 what the story establishes is both the placid surface of small town respectability and the violent undercurrent of passion and violation that wells up naturally in the underclass but is kept appropriately repressed
5162187 this tale of a solitary boorish misanthropic new hampshire pipe fitter the sole inhabitant of the house from which he evicted his own mother is at once a compelling meditation on identity and a thoroughly engaging story of life on the cold edge of new england

5162192 londoners have so far been largely insulated from the price falls taking place elsewhere in the country
5162193 however sellers who choose to come to the market during the peak holiday season generally have a greater need to sell and as a result properties coming onto the market in july were on average 21 000 cheaper than last month
5162194 areas that are about to benefit from improved transport links appear to be avoiding the worst of the storm that is setting in elsewhere in the capital
5162195 when looking at trends in the market it is important to remember that uk house prices are significantly higher than five years ago
5162196 the current issue affecting the market is largely about the supply of credit a very different situation to the early 90s which was about high interest rates and unemployment the fundamentals underpinning the market remain sound with long term demand for housing low interest rates and low unemployment
5162197 when you are sitting in a cellar under fire it makes no difference to you who is bombing you you have no idea mainly people were hoping that the russians would come and get us out we just wanted to survive
5162198 the georgians started it but then ours began bombing too
5162199 we were two and half days in the bunker without food by the end there were more than 100 people in the bunker with us dead people lay there it was a living hell

5162201 many of my friends died they were hitting us with grad rockets from the hills it was like fighting against a shadow
5162202 they were shelling us from all sides and this was the response
5162203 why did saakashvili do this why did they bomb my city just because i am ossetian they promised us they would not fire and then they attacked the city
5162204 we are sometimes finding whole families in basements all thats left of them is bones their families cant recognise them

5162237 during the past 100 years the citizens of the entire country suffering under the yoke of the unequal treaties which gave foreigners special concessions and extra territorial status in china were unanimous in their demand that the national humiliation be avenged
5162238 ours will no longer be a nation subject to insult and humiliation
5162239 the question of western humiliation is always unconsciously inside us
5162240 there is something almost in our dna that triggers autonomic and sometimes extreme responses to foreign criticism or put downs

5162298 for years i have made fun of the norwegians i realize now that making fun of another ethnic group is insulting and offensive but i have so many jokes and i wondered if there was a way to use my jokes without insulting any ethnic group then i thought about the hittites they lived back in old testament times and there are no hittites today so i wont be in any danger of offending anyone if i tell jokes about the hittites

5162321 we give thanks to god always for all of you constantly mentioning you in our prayers remembering before our god and father your work of faith and labour of love and steadfastness of hope in our lord jesus christ for we know brothers loved by god that he has chosen you because our gospel came to you not only in word but also in power and in the holy spirit and with full conviction you know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake and you became imitators of us and of the lord for you received the word in much affliction with the joy of the holy spirit so that you became an example to all the believers in macedonia and in achaia for not only has the word of the lord sounded forth from you in macedonia and achaia but your faith in god has gone forth everywhere so that we need not say anything for they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you and how you turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come

5162443 tak tahulah ayahku orang sepertinya baru sekali ini aku melihatnya
5162444 ketahuilah dialah yang menghapuskan kenikmatan sementara dialah yang memisahkan pertemuan di dunia dialah malaikatul maut

5162453 hemos conseguido un valioso empate que creo que fue justo por suerte pudimos mejorar en la segunda etapa y llegar al empate pero de haber un ganador tendr a que haber sido gimnasia

5162462 projectors suspended from the ceiling project computer generated images onto the tables and interfaces this images change in real time as if they were physically attached to the interfaces when players operate them also sounds are produced in relation to the movement of images since the interfaces have close relation to the reaction of images players can operate images and sounds in the same way when they operates ordinary interfaces and gradually feels these illusions as equivalent as the actual objects push twist turn and slide are the four features that each of the table specializes in
5162463 jesus does not look so much at the greatness of our actions or even at their difficulty as at the love with which we do them

5162486 me voy satisfecha porque luch con todo mi coraz n es un buen lugar y se los dedico a ellos

5162491 fue un recorrido relativamente bueno esperaba m s columpios y no fue as pero en lo personal fue descontrol de mi parte
5162492 ill call the deputy mayor for public health next summer ill put you right in the morgue
5162493 that would pay for your housing and meals and you wouldnt have so much debt
5162494 then go to your schools foundations division on their web site theres often scholarship money that doesnt get distributed because students dont want to take the time to write the essays or do the paperwork
5162495 its the first thing that everyone mentions the thing that everyone wants to know about him isnt that peculiar they say but i dont know that it is that peculiar
5162496 a lot of it makes an awful lot of sense and a lot of movie directors that ive worked with work in a similar way
5162497 for instance i never sat down and had a big conversation about my character with christopher nolan
5162498 im not trivializing it woody is certainly an eccentric individual but i think theres an awful lot of nonsense thats cooked up around the cult of woody allen
5162499 we got there and we didnt really know what we were going to do with it
5162500 the good thing is that woody shoots all of the exploratory stuff
5162501 because theres nothing worse than doing that thing where you rehearse something and something good happens and then you all sit around and go and that was great wasnt it that thing that happened
5162502 it never works so i appreciate the fact that he shoots all that working out stuff
5162503 and we did it for a long time that scene and we worked it in lots of different ways and we shot it in lots of different ways and i think whats finally there is a mishmash of things that we tried out but it was written so brilliantly that scene that it would have worked anyway
5162504 ive lived in england my whole life but my mothers from detroit
5162505 i essentially can be american as much as i can be english
5162506 its not a light decision at all to go into something that all of your family does for obvious reasons
5162507 and there was definitely a stage where i didnt tell anyone that i wanted to act even though i might have wanted to somewhere deep down my rebellion didnt really amount to much apart from wandering around at family parties and telling everyone i was going to be a painter
5162508 thats the thing if i was going to rebel properly i would have had to have been a banker or a rocket scientist but that side of my brain was not functioning at all
5162509 without wanting to come over all sort of feminist about it its just brilliant to watch a female director because there arent many of them around unfortunately she has a knack of just commanding everyones respect whilst being very witty and brilliant
5162510 its about two neighboring apartments in a building in downtown new york
5162511 catherine keener and her husband oliver platt and their 15 year old daughter live in one and the other one is home to a woman in her 90s who has two grandchildren who are me and amanda peet were sort of caring for her
5162512 when youre a 14 year old and youre fantasizing about where your lifes going to go i sat around fantasizing about playing a particular type of woody allen american heroine in a particular type of romantic bittersweet funny woody allen film
5162513 and suddenly i was sitting there with it in my lap is this really happening its very peculiar
5162514 but then youre set with a whole other set of problems
5162515 you know be careful what you wish for youve got to live up to your own expectations of yourself which is always a nightmare
5162516 is one of the first observations from about coms page on being a home buyer in a falling market of course youve got a lot of things to consider including how much you might lose by selling your current house just to snap up a bargain
5162517 dont be shocked if you hear throw in that plasma tv and weve got a deal
5162518 we lost our moral high ground and set a precedent that invites any country on earth to do exactly the same thing
5162519 but obviously they cant play in a big game with the likes of doyle or phil hellmuth but in this show they actually can
5162520 but you dont have to be a poker player to enjoy the show
5162521 you get a guy like scotty nguyen and to watch him work a room is absolutely amazing
5162522 the professionals can joke and needle each other and be more comfortable in a way that they cant when theyre playing for hundreds of thousands of dollars
5162523 plus the audience will learn a little bit about the game as the players explain why they played a hand a certain way
5162524 since ive become speaker my flagship issue has been energy security and addressing the global climate crisis
5162525 energy independence is a national security economic environmental health and moral issue
5162526 the notion that oil companies are just sitting on oil leases is a myth
5162527 any measure that reduces oil firms margins in america is likely to have the effect of diverting at least some investment to other countries and so exacerbate the shortage of fuel produced at home
5162528 america has only 1 6 percent of the worlds oil supply but we use 24 percent so drilling isnt much of a solution at all
5162529 equivalent of 30 years of current imports from saudi arabia
5162530 the planet is gods creation and we have a moral responsibility to preserve it
5162531 natural seepage from the sea floor is a much larger source of oil in american waters than is offshore drilling
5162532 america can achieve true greatness when we work together to make certain that every voice in america is a voice that will be heard
5162533 i think everybody on the planet has been trying to give him some kind of obstacle
5162534 were trying to hes kind of crossed the bridge and taken swimming to the next level
5162535 people can question all they want but the facts are the facts ive got the results to prove it
5162536 the least they could have done was given us a gift
5162537 the feature saves the buyer at most just a few hundred dollars a year the annual value of the forgone interest
5162538 each candidate is carefully pandering to a smorgasbord of special interest groups ranging from gay lesbian and transgender people to children of illegal immigrants to working mothers to evangelical christians
5162539 there is one group no one has recognized and it is the group that will decide the election the angry white man the angry white man comes from all economic backgrounds from dirt poor to filthy rich he represents all geographic areas in america from urban sophisticate to rural redneck deep south to mountain west left coast to eastern seaboard
5162540 weve had comments from angry brown men a filipino american chippewa indians black men and lots of angry white women
5162541 so i really did strike a chord and i guess it is that people feel like theyre not being listened to by our government people want some fiscal sanity they dont want people to just stand there with their hands out and be given something for doing nothing there are a lot of people who feel like theyre pulling the freight for the rest of the country and theyre sick of it
5162542 i suppose so tepidly he was all wrong on immigration but hes right on national defense environmentally hes got to be more proactive than bush was no one could be worse than bush
5162543 i think people are supporting him out of emotion rather than a rational analysis of his policies
5162544 if you want more taxes on people who really make this country run working americans to support yet another generation of sit on your butt and collect a check slackers then obamas your man

5162554 yes we are aware of the similarity and have changed the page to the
5162555 does not require us to sacrifice our own security and welfare to the convenience or advantage of others self preservation is the first principle of our nature when our lives and properties are at stake it would be foolish and unnatural to refrain from such measures as might preserve them because it would be detrimental to others
5162556 tell me not of the british commons lords and ministerial tools i scorn to let my life depend upon the pleasure of any of them
5162557 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5162558 what makes the temptation of power so semmingly irresistable maybe it is that power offers an easy substitute for the hard task of love it seems easier to be god than to love god easier to control people than to love people easier to own life than to love life
5162559 i have a twenty five year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies

5162592 when i chopped the last stroke i really thought it cost me the race
5162593 but it happened to be the exact opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i ended up making the right decision trying to take a short fast stroke to get my hand on the wall first
5162594 i was more or less trying to count my strokes hoping id be dead on at the turns im disappointed because i know i can go faster but there was nothing i could do i handled it the best way i could
5162595 when i flipped at the 50 and i still saw how far ahead he was and he was the world record i thought it really crossed my mind for a split second theres no way

5162618 honestly its the parades that give me the most heartburn
5162619 no matter how well i plan them anything goes on the day of the parade it gives me nightmares except i call them fair mares
5162620 you get all kinds the prima donnas the ones who seem like pros the ones who think theyre pros the ones with knees shaking so hard you wonder if theyre going to get to the microphone
5162621 and with some the minute they get on stage you can tell theyre going to have a career out of this d j snuggles the beatboxer was one of them a performer at the top of his game
5162622 most of the people who work at the fairgrounds even the garbage guys know about the parades and are ready for them
5162623 but one year a van that was running an errand came down the street toward one of the bands and just tried to squeeze through it was terrifying its stuff like that that gives me fair mares

5162663 this is an occasion for the 1 5 billion muslims to look at the seriousness of this decision
5162664 the west is accusing muslims of extremism and terrorism if someone exploded a bomb on his body he would be right to do so unless the british government apologises and withdraws the sir title
5162665 the sir title from britain for blasphemer salman rushdie has hurt the sentiments of the muslims across the world every religion should be respected i demand the british government immediately withdraw the title as it is creating religious hatred
5162666 sir salmans knighthood is a reflection of his contribution to literature throughout a long and distinguished career which has seen him receive international recognition for a substantial body of work
5162667 it is simply untrue that this knighthood is intended as an insult to islam or the prophet mohammed
5162668 without religion how will people know the difference between right and wrong
5162669 i think ive found a country where religious kooks who run it are crazier and dumber than our american leaders in some ways its a little reassuring

5162673 i regret that i have but one life to give for my country
5162674 i do not want my grandchildren to grow up in that kind of religious world
5162675 i think ive found a country where religious kooks who run it are crazier and dumber than our american leaders
5162676 avowedly secular rushdie is a self described atheist he is a distinguished supporter of the british humanist association
5162677 is part of the pattern that people who are members of the muslim faith are very much part of our whole wider community and they receive honours in this country in just the same way as any other citizen

5162728 the concern had previously been that we were close to a threshold where the atlantic circulation system would stop
5162729 we now believe we are much farther from that threshold thanks to improved modeling and ocean measurements the gulf stream and the north atlantic current are more stable than previously thought
5162730 the bottom line is that the atmosphere is warming up so much that a slowdown of the north atlantic current will never be able to cool europe

5162748 i hope he intends to honour the pledge this time
5162749 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5162750 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5162751 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5162752 im the hall monitor in this family and nobody likes the hall monitor
5162753 a sickening sweet smell i dont think its ever going to go away
5162754 t here are no military installations in the city of
5162755 the attack was short sharp and deadly enough to send the georgians fleeing in humiliating panic
5162756 the western media especially cnn is feeding you complete horseshit russia did not invade georgia first
5162757 missile defense washington and poland just moved the world closer to war
5162758 the signing now insures an escalation of tensions between russia and nato and a new cold war arms race in full force it is important for readers to understand the ability of one of two opposing sides to put anti missile missiles to within 90 miles of the territory of the other in even a primitive first generation anti missile missile array gives that side virtual victory in a nuclear balance of power and forces the other to consider unconditional surrender or to pre emptively react by launching its nuclear strike before 2012
5162759 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation
5162760 us troops on monday july 14 began military exercises near the russian border in ex soviet ukraine and were poised to launch them in georgia amid tense relations between moscow and washington a ceremony inaugurating the was held off ukraines black sea coast against anti nato protests and a hostile reaction from officials in russia sea breeze 2008 includes forces from armenia azerbaijan belgium britain canada denmark france georgia germany greece latvia macedonia and turkey the us georgia joint exercises will be held at the vaziani military base less than 100 kilometers 60 miles from the russian border with a total of 1 650 servicemen taking part
5162761 this is a formula for an injection of us military and naval forces into georgia of indeterminate scope and duration it will certainly involve the presence of hundreds if not thousands of uniformed us military personnel on the ground and a substantial number of warships in the region the us is introducing this military force into a situation that remains highly unstable and combustible raising the possibility of a direct military clash between the united states and russia
5162762 the guidelines are designed to minimise the use of animals in scientific research through focusing on the three rs the replacement of animal research with other types of research when possible reduction of the number of animals used in research and refinement of research techniques to minimise pain and distress
5162763 when it is necessary to study animals in medical research all involved have an obligation to care for the animals in the best ways possible
5162764 but the issue remains though that while we have these great documents there is still no compulsory training for new and existing researchers on the laws and the best ways to reduce pain and distress
5162765 and they are not trained in the many excellent alternatives like computer modelling for example that can do just as good a job in testing without involving animals
5162766 at the moment there is a feeling there is far too much animal testing going on because of a lack of knowledge in many quarters and unfortunately a document while encouraging is not going to change that
5162767 i sometimes ask myself why am i a republican but then i realize i am sooo not a democrat
5162768 there are a lot of people that are really hostile
5162769 i think a lot of people are blaming the republican party and george bush for a lot of problems
5162770 but i think it really brings out the best parts of being a republican youre going to be pushed on what you believe in and what you stand for every day
5162771 its fair to say the democrats have been ahead of us
5162772 we realize the importance of catching up the effort into making certain we get young republicans plugged in
5162773 but theyre learning about the whole ticket senator obamas message is really that of the democratic party
5162774 we realize theres a certain segment of our population tend to be young people but not necessarily that gets most of their information from computers and through the internet
5162775 the videos are really unique and something a lot of people saw on a grass roots level
5162776 i went to the state republican party convention in spokane and people came up to me and recognized me from the video and that kind of freaked me out a little
5162777 republicans think that government should only do what people cant do for themselves
5162778 its harder for people who dont own property to care about property taxes
5162779 for an older person its either that or mow the lawn if its someone thats younger its either go doorbelling or go to seafair
5162780 i think theyre move red org a small group of young activists who have had success with self promotion mostly through pessimism and negative attacks
5162781 but i think the democratic youth outreach is more comprehensive
5162782 id like to think that it has more to do with dino rossi
5162783 thats where the passion comes from how close it was
5162784 its amazing to know with 100 people at our barbecue if every person here gets one other person to vote we win
5162785 the memories came flooding back from a good time in my life

5162791 they have left everyone of us the ultimate gift which is that we all get to be kids forever
5162792 were certainly going to investigate it and i certainly wouldnt mind it
5162793 im absolutely floored by the honesty integrity and thouroughness of this cornerstone online casinos work
5162794 and i have already sent a nomination to the board for the writing medal its this kind of brilliance that really helps the world at large
5162795 im happy prof regener furnari invited me to join the team
5162796 and this will be a great highlight for my resume as i look for employment after college
5162797 its a tough world out there for employment within the online casinos sector
5162798 so i invited strong students to help me in this project hopefully this experience will help them gain meaningful employment later on
5162799 because it allows the entire general public to learn about things they never before furthermore it may even convince them to go out and buy the professors book
5162800 this great work will mean high profits for our firm
5162801 and were also very honored that the author and student research team chose our firm to share its work with the world
5162802 but only because of the high expectations and standards of our online casinos project we have worked tirelessly for about a year now and we hope to release the best review of online casinos thought in decades
5162803 ive been working within the online casinos field for years and never before have i seen better work out of prof lakendra bach
5162804 well be releasing the final version of our online casinos study this evening
5162805 which will make the twilight hours at the local book shops very interesting
5162806 basically were looking at new ideas within the online casinos realm of thought that have never really been put in writing before
5162807 and this is what makes the release such an exciting event for our community new ideas means new developments and success for our area

5162827 taking the cans out to the street always makes me feel important
5162828 yeah for some reason it just makes me feel important
5162829 well it should because it really is a useful and responsible job you know doing chores is the very best way for kids to get good self esteem
5162830 yeah because then they know that their parents really do need them and they also know that theyre competent and can do things that are actually useful so that gives them good self esteem
5162831 and next year ill teach you to mow the lawn and you can feel really useful
5162832 i dont think well be paying you to mow the lawn well just be giving you the gift of self confidence

5162848 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5162849 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5162850 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5162851 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5162861 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting divorced in the first place things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
5162862 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
5162863 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
5162864 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
5162865 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily
5162866 when you can cut the incoming freshman class in half putting half on tuesday and half on wednesday it eases the strain that it puts on the campus traffic patterns
5162867 we found splitting it helped tremendously last year thats why the university continued that approach this year
5162868 when you start looking at the entrance to the university on port republic the entrance right off of main street and the entrance off of university boulevard those are the three primary entrances to the university youll see most of the traffic coming in and out of
5162869 everybody feels it and we felt it a little with the students being gone
5162870 ive worked in this town for awhile and i know what its like when the students come back into town weve been planning for a long time and weve bulked up events
5162871 and if jmu students wants to be part of that community thats great
5162872 a buddy of mine bought it for the engine for 150 dollars
5162873 he was on his way to the junkyard with it when i bought it off him
5162874 here in the rockingham county fair races weve got a teacher a truck driver a secretary an accountant its diverse
5162875 i worked as a flag man at a race four years ago in mechanicsville and loved it
5162876 theyre a swell bunch of people even if i dont win nothin i have fun
5162877 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5162878 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5162879 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
5162880 they were the closest to us before the war and now they are the most frightening enemy
5162881 it feels like your own brother has cut off your head
5162882 after what happened it should be clear that they should have self determination
5162883 the reality is that for 15 years at least south ossetia and abkhazia have been independent in fact
5162884 its not true the goal of russia is peace in the caucasus
5162885 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
5162886 substantial mental impairment at the time which would enable him to be found guilty of manslaughter
5162887 the calls related apparently to the sexual activities of cathy podestas boyfriend steven bannister and included that it was believed he was hiv positive he said
5162888 in the interview the accused said his mother was extremely upset about the calls and the fact she may have contracted the disease
5162889 substantial mental impairment amp squo amp squo at the time which would enable him to be found guilty of manslaughter
5162890 if i were called in to rename web 2 0 i think id call it gilligans web
5162891 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5162892 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5162893 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5162894 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5162895 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5162896 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5162897 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5162898 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5162899 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5162900 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5162901 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5162902 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5162903 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5162904 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5162905 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5162906 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5162907 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5162908 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
5162909 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered
5162910 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
5162911 take the knickknacks you want but these are reserved for the daughter that deserves them
5162912 and i will dash them one against another even the fathers and the sons together saith the lord i will not pity nor spare nor have mercy but destroy them
5162913 now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling
5162914 pay no attention to those biblical glorifications of merciless slaughter and destruction behind the curtain the great and powerful
5162915 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it
5162916 found out the bible has soooooooooooo many holes and wasnt even translated correctly into english so what really are we reading
5162917 nihilism is not only the belief that everything deserves to perish but one actually puts one shoulder to the plough one destroys
5162918 nihilism is not only the belief that everything deserves to perish but one actually puts one shoulder to the plough one destroys
5162919 the influence that nietzsche has had on other philosophers and policy makers is quite profound
5162920 this is an incredible find not only the earliest sound film shot in australia using the then new technology of sound recorded directly onto film but also the earliest australian sound film to be found he said

5162922 private practice at first glance looks like its about to die but by the end of its premiere tonight it has miraculously come back to life apparently without even the aid of a tall handsome mysterious script doctor
5162923 people at first were not so much concerned with what the story meant what they wanted to know was where these lotteries were held and whether they could go there and watch
5162924 baptist minister would never divulge what happened during that interview
5162925 three graybeards and one younger man a member of the rising generation
5162926 oh yeah i remember it all i was the one who sold her the poison can you believe it
5162927 give a man a fish and hell eat for day but teach a man to fish and hell eat for a lifetime
5162928 ladies and gentlemen ill be brief the issue here is not whether we broke a few rules or took a few liberties with our female party guests we did but you cant hold a whole fraternity responsible for the behavior of a few sick twisted individuals for if you do then shouldnt we blame the whole fraternity system and if the whole fraternity system is guilty then isnt this an indictment of our educational institutions in general i put it to you greg isnt this an indictment of our entire american society well you can do whatever you want to us but i for one am not going to stand here and listen to you badmouth the united states of america gentlemen

5162941 nanotechnology is one of the three pre eminent environmental law issues
5162942 once people get a handle on climate change theyre going to look back and say this is really the other big thing we need to be focusing on
5162943 theres interest in nanotech in the legal field because of the unknowns and the nuanced challenges it creates for existing frameworks
5162944 attorneys and law firms doing regulatory law see a fundamental disconnect between the current setup and the reality of nanomaterials the novel and fundamentally different properties they bring
5162945 the fundamental question seems to be are nanomaterials new chemicals or existing
5162946 epa decided that there is no subcategory of nanomaterials under tsca size is irrelevant
5162947 the scientific consensus on nanomaterials is that nano does not mean merely tiny but rather materials that have the capacity to act in fundamentally different ways
5162948 our concern is that health and safety research and environmental impact research is absent
5162949 the shape of litigation in nanotechnologies remains to be seen in many ways
5162950 for nano related products liability the high stakes health effects are still a ways down the road and were unlikely to see it until next generation device and pharmaceutical spaces
5162951 insurance companies and reinsurers are similarly interested like lawyers because they see this great unknown that is moving forward
5162952 insurance companies and reinsurers are ahead of the curve in terms of risk projection risk identification quantification and management but thats who they are and what they do
5162953 the big challenge is coming to grips with the fact that there is a considerable amount of ambiguity and uncertainty associated with the commercialization of nanotechnology
5162954 in the past a vacuum of regulation has proved unhelpful to insurers
5162955 lack of regulation is never helpful to liability insurers and the insurance industry should lobby for clarity
5162956 currently agencies seem to be more focused on studying the issues than regulating them
5162957 that trend may be moving toward more regulation it may be that nanotechnology transitions toward a more mandatory regulatory type scheme than what currently exists today
5162958 if the government arrests someone it has to prove why it has done so otherwise the arrest will be wrong this is why some case or allegation of he being a simi member or a member of indian mujahideen has been leveled against him
5162959 he has no communication with simi this is a wrong notion and you should be asking mulayam singh why he is supporting them
5162960 my son is innocent he has never even had an argument with sister or any of his relatives he just teaches
5162961 i know him personally he is not a simi member and these allegations against him are false the central government has lost control and this is being done to increase the pressure on simi
5162962 to win here the feeling is a little bit more special

5162964 that if somebody were to take it away from me he would have to play an incredible tennis schedule win the biggest tournaments dominate the game basically i think rafa totally deserves it

5162973 the idea is not to go crazy and start to have ice cream three times a day
5162974 but it is certainly possible to have a healthy diet with low saturated fat intake by having one serving of high fat dairy a day
5162975 a good healthy dose of skepticism is good for people
5162976 its not that having high fat is protective its that being on a diet may be bad for reproduction

5162991 the terracotta figures were manufactured both in workshops by government laborers and also by local craftsmen the head arms legs and torsos were created separately and then assembled studies show that eight face molds were most likely used and then the clay was added to give them individual facial features once assembled the intricate features such as facial expressions were added
5162992 the terracotta figures are life like and life sized they vary in height uniform and hairstyle in accordance with rank the colored lacquer finish individual facial features and replica weapons and armor used in manufacturing these figures created a realistic appearance

5162994 eindhoven heeft ook een posof club met die vereniging hebben wij twee jaar geleden een festival georganiseerd vijfduizend mensen kwamen er op af wij zijn naar eindhoven uitgeweken omdat we in tilburg geen geschikte locatie konden vinden

5162999 the president will address the nation at 1 00pm 0700 gmt
5163000 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall
5163001 he has seen the sentiments of not just the elected representatives but various institutions who all asked him to move in a particular way and do not destabilise things here
5163002 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter
5163003 they have already suffered significantly as a result of the strike and now they are experiencing an additional loss of work made worse when they can find a job by having to work without a contract under old terms and conditions
5163004 there are some who feel we have all the time in the world to make this deal
5163005 this advisory motion is not in the best interests of sag members or any sag members across the country
5163006 it could delay and prolong the negotiations by emboldening management with a false belief that sag actors are split on the issues
5163007 nothing is happening and we are no closer to a deal than we were six weeks ago
5163008 in failing to bargain realistically with the amptp and remove unattainable items from the table our negotiating team controlled by the current hollywood leadership has pursued an agenda that has more to do with politics than with securing a beneficial contract and has betrayed the trust of the membership
5163009 sag and amptp full committees which combined number over 100 people will meet face to face again when we have reached a deal and shake we are all hopeful that will happen soon
5163010 claims by sags negotiators about informal talks are no more true today than they were when first made two weeks ago
5163011 negotiations concluded when the producers presented their final offer on june 30 and no meetings are scheduled
5163012 mediation is an option available any time the parties mutually agree to it
5163013 mediation does not guarantee that negotiations will accelerate to an agreement and often has slowed the process down as recently seen in the wga negotiations which included mediation
5163014 it has not up to this point been viewed as something the parties feel would facilitate an agreement
5163015 sag has made significant compromises to reach tentative agreement on the resolved issues
5163016 we also believe that what we are asking for to close the gap and make this deal is extremely reasonable and addresses the actual needs of actors and their families in these times of technological advances and economic challenges
5163017 all of the new media terms in the producers final offer including those related to original new media programs are subject to a sunset clause that protects both performers and producers by allowing the two sides to reevaluate all of the new media terms in three years and bargain from a point of greater knowledge about the markets development
5163018 nos hicieron creer que cada uno de nosotros es una media naranja y que la vida s lo tiene sentido cu ndo encontramos la otra mitad no nos contaron que ya nacemos enteros que nadie en nuestra vida merece cargar en las espaldas la responsabilidad de completar lo que nos falta
5163019 but as for me and my household we will serve the lord
5163020 we will serve the lord our god and obey him
5163021 pretty radical but we think it makes the most sense
5163022 theyre proposing some pretty innovative and in some cases difficult things to do
5163023 its too early for me to predict how this is going to be received
5163024 anything is possible if you have enough money to do it
5163025 we just cant tweak our way out of this flooding
5163026 we were shocked by the volumes of water coming out of this watershed
5163027 and the success or failure of such an effort really depends upon whether you can get all the stakeholders to agree if there is not a consensus on how to proceed something like this could be held up at many stages
5163028 the first thing they say when they visit is can we go downstairs

5163037 perjalanan ini bukan tentang berapa banyak permen yang telah saya kumpulkan tapi tentang bagaimana saya menikmatinya dengan berbagi dan berbahagia
5163038 the business is flourishing and there is a good reason for dreamworks to be hiring so many people
5163039 were in the one part of the entertainment business that just continues to show tremendous growth in the international market in particular
5163040 this will give us a better and more productive space to build a bigger pipeline of feature films
5163041 it changes the experience for moviegoers it changes the movie theater environment and it changes the artistic tools that storytellers and filmmakers have
5163042 the biggest thing thats come out in our lifetime in movies
5163043 the amount being paid to the industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content that we own and control is far too small
5163044 if that does not become the case as far as warner music is concerned we will not license to those games
5163045 ecosystems from which people other than the recording industry have derived the majority of value created
5163046 music publishers see music based games as a growth opportunity in an otherwise struggling music business and theyre trying to grab as much of that growth as they can
5163047 it took a lot of star power to knock batman off his perch but tropic thunder did well
5163048 as the summer is winding down people seem to be in the mood to have fun and laugh at the box office
5163049 nothing is happening and were no closer to a deal today than we were six weeks ago
5163050 they intend to simply sit still until the upcoming board elections are concluded rather than make the unpopular moves necessary to make a deal
5163051 the willful inaction of our negotiators is costing our members money every day
5163052 embolden management with a false belief that sag actors are split on the issues

5163106 this is nonsense these are techniques used alongside animal research only about 10 of medical research involves animals from time to time non animal techniques do come along that replace animal tests but their adoption is rarely controversial as they are almost invariably cheaper and quicker the vast majority of scientists who undertake animal experiments also use non animal methods it is a case of using the appropriate technique for the question being asked of course new animal techniques such as transgenic animals are regularly developed so the situation is very fluid
5163107 i actually kind of stumbled onto turkish coffee as a possible product idea by a coincidence while i was searching for ways to stop smoking
5163108 as anyone who has tried to stop smoking knows after meals can be one of the worst times to deal with the urge to smoke
5163109 i decided to prepare turkish coffee after my meals to deal with my urges and it sure has worked for me
5163110 takes several minutes to prepare which keeps a person busy
5163111 before i bought i researched through the internet and talked with several
5163112 i get a lot of orders from the u s military probably because they are discovering turkish coffee in the gulf and iraq
5163113 many people think that the turkish coffee is a special blend that is only grown in turkey so it has to be exported and bought separately

5163124 mas de la mitad de los alumnos que salen de la primaria no saben leer escribir ni contar poco se hace para sanar esta calamidad
5163125 lo que plantemos es saber porque la educaci n b sica de primaria y secundaria tiende a darle principalmente prioridad a las reas cient ficas al ingles y a la inform tica mientras que poco o casi nada le preocupa la materias como la historia la literatura y las derivadas de la filosof a como la l gica tica etc
5163126 por qu cambian el fundamento de los estudios de la ense anza b sica es claro que quieren desaparecer o minimizar estas materias sino por qu dar prioridad a las materias cient ficas y cibern ticas podemos decir que la respuesta es prefieren lo til que lo honesto santo tomas de aquino divide el bien entre honesto til y deleitable a til es un medio para alcanzar un fin superior b honesto se desea por si mismo es meta limite del movimiento apetitivo c deleitable lo que aquieta el deseo cuando ya tiene lo que se deseaba
5163127 de donde se concluye que estos tres bienes tienen un orden natural en el cual se debe educar a la juventud primero en fijarse metas luego usando para alcanzarlas lo til despu s tener lo deleitable ahora bien sin duda la educaci n basica esta fundada en la utilidad lo economico a caso queridos lectores ignoran que ante la incapacidad del gobierno mexicano para controlar emigraci n de millones de paisanos al vecino pais por la falta de empleo en nuestro territorio trata el gobierno mexicano de dotar con estos elementos ingles computaci n entre otros a los emigrantes para que puedan ingresar a laborar de aquel lado del rio bravo
5163128 estamos de acuerdo que el gobierno mexicano debe procurar una vida digna a los ciudadanos pero en que momento
5163129 proponemos una reforma educativa que busque la formaci n del hombre de una manera integral tomando en cuenta la historia la literatura y la filosofia a la historia es maestra de la vida para adquirir la prudencia se requiere la experiencia de los ancianos no somos los primeros en la tierra otros han estado antes que nosotros que tuvieron sus propias experiencias por qu no aprovecharlas la experiencia de la vida del obrar humano de los xitos fracasos la vida de los grandes hombres de los tiranos de los h roes y de los traidores la podemos recibir por la historia saber que es lo que ha hecho grande a los hombres sin ignorar el papel que dios juega en la historia
5163130 que nuestros hijos conozcan la historia de m xico la historia universal o de lo contrario seguiremos perdiendo nuestras ra ces seremos cada d a menos mexicanos no saben queridos padres de familia que nuestros j venes tienden mas a imitar a personajes de televisi n de grupos de rock e incluso deportivos producto de la mercadotecnia que los j venes aprendan lo que corresponde a dios los que han luchado por el y lo que corresponde a la revoluci n mundial y a sus secuaces con una vision equilibrada de la historia nacional
5163131 b la literatura que estudien la literatura nacional y universal cada pueblo tiene su propio genio y reservar un lugar a los genios universales el hombre sigue siendo el mismo siempre salido de las manos de dios creador llamado a la vida sobrenatural debilitado por el pecado original redimido por jesucristo la literatura cl sica describe al hombre como es su cuerpo su alma su inteligencia y sus pasiones anhelos tentaciones con sus victorias y derrotas
5163132 nuestros productos patrios deben ser los primeros en el mundo excelentes precios merecedores de confianza y si soy obrero demostrare tener amor a la patria trabajando en esto la ciencia patria ha de levantarse a grandes alturas y alcanzar la estima del mundo entero y si soy sabio y trabajo en ello tendre amor a la patria la juventud de nuestra patria debe ser la mas brillante y de mas recio car cter que todas las del mundo si soy maestro profesor sacerdote o padre y trabajo en aras de tan noble ideal con abnegada persistencia sera de buen ley mi amor a la patria la fe de nuestro pueblo ha de ser firme como las monta as gigantescas mas alla de las nubes si contribuyo a ello amo a mi patria la moral de mi pueblo ha de ser brillante y pura como el ojo de los ni os amor a la patria que ni degenera en ciega idolatria de lo propio ni quiere aniquilar a otras naciones ni quiere dominar al mundo amor a la patria que al estimar su propia raza no aborrece a los pueblos extranjeros porque sabe que todos somos hijos de un mismo padre

5163138 we regret that the u s still refuses to admit the real cause for what happened which is that georgian president mikhail saakashvilis regime in violation of all its international obligations unleashed a war against the people of south ossetia
5163139 we took up station guarding the opposed landing on the abkhaz shore when all of a sudden four high speed targets were detected we sent out an iff signal and the targets didnt react receiving a command from the flagship we got into formation and right at that moment the unidentified targets opened fire on the ship formation and flagship the cruiser was damaged and a small fire broke out aboard then fearing for seaworthiness the flagship withdrew from the firing area

5163147 in georgias far region of south ossetia russian tanks are going through villages inhabited by the georgian population and throwing people out of the houses pushing people into concentration camps that they are setting up in those villages and separating men and women and doing worse kind of atrocities ive heard of since the balkans or the war in chechnya
5163148 several hundred kilometres or miles removed from south ossetia where villages are again inhabited by georgians they are throwing out every single georgian man or woman and children
5163149 they moved into the town of gori and they ransacked the town looted the town these are regular russian troops they go into houses they destroy houses there is all this documentary footage around that can prove it they are taking things like furniture toilet seats killing people terrorising people
5163150 this is freedom in general at stake this is not about some far away remote country about which we know little
5163151 im sickened sickened of this cynical and absolutely unfounded allegation

5163153 you know what germany told the world they were attacked by poland in 1939 the soviet union was attacked by finland in 1939 soviet union was attacked by afghanistan in 1979
5163154 didnt the world learn enough i am really sickened that there are people in the west asking these questions because thats exactly what the russians want its our territory for gods sake theyre killing our people
5163155 the russians never meant any ceasefire this is a kind of ceasefire that i dont know they had with afghanistan in 1979 or that germany had with poland in 1939 there is no ceasefire they are moving
5163156 frankly some of the first statements from washington were perceived by the russians almost as a green light for doing this because they were too soft
5163157 everything the americans had achieved from the cold war is being undermined and destroyed right now

5163179 oy that puny little blade isnt worthy of a three year old now my sword oh it is a rare prize
5163180 got it off an rouge noble who though he could cheat his way to a larger fortune by robbing the king beautiful isnt she made by geovonich the finest swordsmiths in the land
5163181 how dare you imply that i stole it i had it made
5163182 it was forged in the far east by a group of monks they train their whole lives making works of art from metal that never breaks they use special techniques to make the metal hard durable and light when they gave me the sword and found out what i was going to do with they were a bit distraught they told me they never wanted to make an instrument of death when i refused to give it back they cut off their own hands saying that they would never again allow their talents to be used for death
5163183 yes i can honestly say any swordsman worth his salt would give his left arm for this
5163184 how dare a pathetic waste like you insult my honor
5163185 i may just have to kill you for that that is unless you get down on your knees and beg for forgiveness
5163186 not much for words are you maybe a taste of steel with loosen your tongue
5163187 take a look at my blade it is not shiny or made by any sect of special monks but there is one thing my sword had that yours doesnt
5163188 it is the scars of battle i know nothing about this blade other than its mine it is the warrior who makes the weapon not the other way around your sword could split mountains in half but it does you little good if you cant use it
5163189 when you serve anothers dream you will find your own fulfilled

5163201 enough was enough i thought to myself my knees can handle this from now on
5163202 i have been proposing and i am proposing russia act as a guarantor of south ossetian autonomy within georgia
5163203 i love ossetians as a president and as a ordinary citizen of this country i admire and respect ossetian history and culture every ethnic ossetian has been an inseparable part of georgian history for centuries we are proud of you and our unity georgia is strong for its diversity georgia has never been and will never be a mono ethnic country georgia belongs to all of us regardless of our ethnicity lets take care of our country together lets together avoid the violence lets work together for a better future lets forget everything negative that has happened in the past and lets together think about our common future
5163204 the firing positions of georgian troops that had shelled the city of tskhinvali and the positions of peacekeeping forces were suppressed by the ordnance and tanks of formations of the 58th army stationed in the outskirts of the south ossetian capital
5163205 the georgian troops that entered south ossetia are within the range of the firepower of the 58th army units in the future any shooting in the responsibility zone of russian peacekeepers will be stifled
5163206 they georgian troops gathered the girls like cattle locked them up in a building and burnt them alive
5163207 we personally saw how a georgian tank ran over an old woman who was running away with two children they knifed down a year and a half old kid
5163208 a tank with a banner georgian special forces on its front leveled a memorial cemetery in the yard of secondary school 5
5163209 there is no other name but that of genocide to describe the forms the georgian forces action has taken because these acts have become mass scale in nature and have been directed against specific people against the civilian population and against peacekeepers who were carrying out their duties to maintain peace the information we are receiving attests to the fact that crimes of the most serious kind have been committed people have been murdered burned crushed by tanks and had their throats cut
5163210 saddam hussein of course needed to be hanged for destroying several shiite villages but not the current georgian leadership which in less than an hour drove tanks through children and old people and burned people alive in their homes these leaders need to be protected
5163211 it is very clear that the us is reaping in georgia what it sowed in kosovo let us review what happened in that conflict the us attacked a sovereign state and one that happened to be an ally of russia for actions that took place entirely within its own borders and could in no way able construed as aggression against another state it devastated the infrastructure of serbia seized a piece of its territory and then elevated kosovo to the status of an independent puppet state
5163212 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
5163213 control is all about imposing your view of reality on the minds of others since overt political persecution is no longer widely accepted the elites have resorted to fighting wars over hearts and minds western media manipulation is not readily noticeable since if that were the case the simulations plausibility would fall apart immediately as was the case in the soviet union this makes them far more insidious and dangerous to freedom than any repressive dictatorship for in the latter one knows one is a slave while too many westerners continue to be believe they are free whereas in fact they are also slaves like the rest of us

5163260 it is a minefield as everyone has such strong feelings about it our portrayal is based on lengthy research
5163261 the romans used a number of ways to crucify people and this was one of the most common and effective methods
5163262 the makers wanted something that wasnt the typical image that would surprise the viewers this is not an attempt to be iconoclastic but to get people to look again at the events surrounding his death
5163263 they have clearly decided to go for this option because its unusual and will jolt viewers and challenge them about their assumptions
5163264 their portrayal causes a problem as it seems to ignore what the bible says
5163265 theres a lot of significance attached to the traditional image that has been lost in this version and is likely to upset those who dont like a move away from what theyre used to
5163266 thats a serious and dangerous thing to do but sadly utterly predictable and regrettable jesuss nails went through his hands not his forearms we should be true to history and the events that occurred

5163285 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5163286 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

5163290 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5163291 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5163292 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5163293 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5163294 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5163295 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5163296 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5163297 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5163298 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5163299 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5163300 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5163301 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5163302 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5163303 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5163304 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5163305 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5163306 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5163307 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5163308 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5163309 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5163310 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5163311 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5163312 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5163313 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5163314 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5163315 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5163316 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5163317 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5163318 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5163319 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5163320 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5163321 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5163322 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5163323 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5163324 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5163325 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5163326 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5163327 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5163328 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5163329 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto

5163335 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5163336 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5163337 im for morality but morality goes beyond sex to human freedom and social justice evangelists cannot be closely identified with any particular party or person we have to stand in the middle in order to preach to all people right and left i havent been faithful to my own advice in the past i will be in the future
5163338 oh how important is my bible the most important book in our lives
5163339 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
5163340 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
5163341 almost all of them have been sent to the area close to the conflict zone
5163342 they of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages
5163343 but the current georgian rulers who in one hour simply wiped 10 ossetian villages from the face of the earth the georgian rulers which used tanks to run over children and the elderly which threw civilians into cellars and burnt them they georgian leaders are players that have to be protected
5163344 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats it is a real shame
5163345 it is ridiculous to ask us to do this because georgia will never use force against its own people as simple as that
5163346 yes theyre approaching the us state of georgia the other fools they dont know what theyre talking about
5163347 yes its the russkies alright other states could have helped georgia but we didnt feel like it we just dont like you to be honest i just hope they dont reach texas
5163348 do unto others as you would have them do unto you
5163349 clearly the weight of historical and medical evidence indicates that jesus was dead before the wound to his side was inflicted and supports the traditional view that the spear thrust between his right rib probably perforated not only the right lung but also the pericardium and heart and thereby ensured his death accordingly interpretations based on the assumption that jesus did not die on the cross appear to be at odds with modern medical knowledge
5163350 science without religion is lame religion without science is blind
5163351 the brotherhood of man and the uniqueness of the individual
5163352 the mind can proceed only so far upon what it knows and can prove there comes a point where the mind takes a higher plane of knowledge but can never prove how it got there all great discoveries have involved such a leap
5163353 youre supposed to be on disability leave because speedway cant accomedate your drs orders
5163354 y a rien qui marche aujourdhui jai pas de chance jai tout loup
5163355 si verdad qu curioso ahora yo ya soy mayor que l y sin embargo siempre le ver como a ese se or mayor que lo sabe todo
5163356 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5163357 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5163358 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5163359 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5163360 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5163361 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5163362 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5163363 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5163364 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5163365 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5163366 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5163367 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5163368 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5163369 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5163370 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5163371 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5163372 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5163373 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5163374 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5163375 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5163376 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5163377 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5163378 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5163379 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5163382 america needs to stop supporting georgia what saakashvili is doing is no better than what saddam hussein did and if george bush is supporting that like hes supporting georgia hes no better than saddam hussein

5163390 theres a lot of personality infused in just the design alone
5163391 you always do a great job i love reading all your stuff
5163392 suddenly there was a massive explosion which hit a house down the road from us
5163393 our windows shattered and i jumped for cover i grabbed my son and wife and ran down to the basement where i was joined by dozens of other civilians the bombing only got worse it was relentless and went on for hours i never thought it would come to this georgians bombing us not in my wildest imagination
5163394 georgian snipers are taking down anything that moves even outside the towns hospital which is making it hard to deliver the wounded they are not sparing anyone
5163395 houses are being hit around us by rockets we have no food but its too dangerous to go out
5163396 there were bodies lying everywhere in the streets around ruined buildings in cars there is hardly a single building left undamaged
5163397 grad missiles are falling they are taking the city we are running out of ammunition wheres our f ing help
5163398 it all happened so quickly suddenly we were in the middle of heavy fighting i saw our neighbours house get a direct hit i took cover with the kids in the basement it was terrifying
5163399 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
5163400 i was in the hospital on friday where i saw many civilian wounded the hospital was later destroyed by a georgian jet
5163401 russia will not close its eyes on the deaths of russian citizens in south ossetia
5163402 we saw the impact of the air strikes buildings on fire we could hear the russian jets above us in one strike the pilot missed the intended military base instead hitting two apartment blocks
5163403 when we arrived flames were pouring out of the buildings and people were still trapped inside we saw injured civilians being pulled from the buildings
5163404 everything should be included in the system including aircraft carriers
5163405 starting with the fourth submarine we will begin modernizing this class the modernized borei submarines will be the core of russian naval nuclear forces until 2040
5163406 we are aspiring not only to introduce new technologies not only to compete with the west but to take completely new steps which would allow us to look at submarine technologies of the middle of the 21st century

5163410 that was always my favorite part of going back to school
5163411 russias primary goal today is to ensure peace in the caucasus and prevent the further aggression on georgias part and the killings of civilians this goal should be attained through political diplomatic and economic methods russia has such levers
5163412 as soon as the first shot has been fired and aggression started all peacetime laws and agreements become invalid except the geneva humanitarian conventions
5163413 sever diplomatic relations with tbilisi evict the georgian embassy from moscow and stop absolutely all political relations with georgia
5163414 when politicians and diplomats lose then the military start acting it is necessary to admit this defeat and issue an order to the military to defeat the georgian armed forces this has still not been done
5163415 the soldier and the officer need to have a clear order either defense or attack they have to be given a concrete task to smash and eliminate an aggressor when a soldier is told that he should help enforce peace a soldier doesnt know what to do
5163416 behind georgian president mikheil saakashvilis back stands washington he obeyed washingtons will and in fact unleashed war destroyed a city killed about 2 000 peaceful civilians and smashed our peacekeeping battalion
5163417 our peacekeepers armed only with assault rifles and 2 3 magazines had been fired upon by heavy artillery for almost 24 hours
5163418 saakashvili is a fascist puppet and a new goebbels who is misleading public opinion and creating some political camouflage today

5163424 what then is the spirit of liberty i cannot define it i can only tell you my own faith the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understand the minds of other men and women the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interest alongside its own without bias the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded
5163425 the spirit of liberty is the spirit of him who nearly two thousand years ago taught mankind the lesson it has never learned but has never quite forgotten that there may be a kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest
5163426 the use of history is to tell us past themes else we should have to repeat each in his own experience the successes and the failures of our forebears

5163430 we want television screens in the west to be showing not only russian tanks and texts saying russia is at war in south ossetia and with georgia but also to be showing the suffering of the ossetian people the murdered elderly people and children the destroyed towns of south ossetia and regional capital tskhinvali this would be an objective way of presenting the material

5163432 over the course of the past year the congregation for the doctrine of the faith has studies the proposals which you presented on behalf of the house of bishops of the traditional anglican communion during your visit to the offices of this dicastery on october 9 2007
5163433 one can only assume that they are just waiting for the end of the anglican communion in order to offer similar arrangements to catholics in the church of england and elsewhere it wont be long the lambeth conference is nearly finished

5163438 there is the scientistic world view that believes the only valid reality is that which can be physically measured and that everything can be explained in terms of its material components if you ask them to explain love they say that love is a chemical reaction in the brain theres even a name for this chemical phenylethylamine and where do you find this substance in chocolate which is why

5163456 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5163457 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave

5163480 how to effortlessly apply the power of creative visualization to transform your dreams into reality
5163481 anytime you suffer a setback or disappointment put your head down and plow ahead
5163482 dont let someone elses opinion of you become your reality
5163483 i advise you to say your dream is possible and then overcome all inconveniences ignore all the hassles and take a running leap through the hoop even if it is in flames
5163484 too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears
5163485 forgive yourself for your faults and your mistakes and move on
5163486 you dont get in life what you want you get in life what you are
5163487 when you want something you have to be willing to pay your dues
5163488 if you view all the things that happen to you both good and bad as opportunities then you operate out of a higher level of consciousness
5163489 you cannot be wimpy out there on the dream seeking trail dare to break through barriers to find your own path
5163490 other peoples opinion of you does not have to become your reality
5163491 if your opponent is quick to anger seek to irritate him
5163492 you know the difference between cannibals and liberals cannibals only eat their enemies

5163497 hospitability is the foundation of my business philosophy virtually nothing else is as important as how one is made to feel in any business transaction hospitality exists when you believe the other person is on your side the converse is just as true hospitality is present when something happens for you it is absent when something happens to you those two simple propositions for and to express it all
5163498 how the delivery of that product makes the recipient feel
5163499 if they are conceding it to us then it cant be too valuable to them

5163515 we need to know because the amount of alcohol per head of population is a very strong predictor of alcohol related problems particularly things like liver cirrhosis violence motor vehicle accidents and suicide
5163516 we need to know how much alcohols actually being sold and consumed in the australian population we dont have good estimates of that at the moment
5163517 we do have survey data on what people tell us they drink we know that tends to underestimate consumption for a variety of reasons and probably accounts for about 60 per cent of the alcohol that we know is sold at best
5163518 the alcohol industry collect it themselves they pass it on to private market research companies
5163519 you can purchase the data for a very high fee 5 000 or 6 000 to buy data that the industry i think as a condition of being allowed to sell this product should be providing the government
5163520 i dont see why there should be a trade secret or it should be restricted to people with the capacity to pay those sort of amounts of money
5163521 but it certainly provides information that public health and other people can use to argue for changes as we have seen in new south wales for example some of the best recent data has been released by the bureau of crime statistics indicating rising rates of alcohol related assault
5163522 if we could link that sort of data to where the alcohol is being sold we would have a clear idea of what sort of products were contributing to that and we could then build a case for more restrictive policies or more targeted policies to attempt to reduce that harm
5163523 i think that changing the way that some people drink is much more important than counting and measuring the overall consumption of the community

5163573 the imperial powers descended upon china like a swarm of bees looting our treasures and killing our people
5163574 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5163575 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5163576 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5163577 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5163578 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5163579 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5163580 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5163593 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5163594 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5163595 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5163596 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5163597 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5163598 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5163599 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5163600 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5163601 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5163602 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5163603 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5163604 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5163605 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5163606 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5163607 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5163608 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5163609 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5163610 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5163611 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5163612 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5163613 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5163614 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5163615 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5163616 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5163617 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5163618 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5163619 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5163620 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5163621 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5163622 no one likes to be perceived or seen as being arrogant and i dont like that i dont like it and i admit its a problem for me
5163623 if i get asked a question i normally give a straight answer and some people perceive that as arrogance
5163624 thats the way i approach things i try to answer everything truthfully i try to answer everything as directly as i possibly can i call things as i see them
5163625 some people see that as arrogance i admit that and it is a problem for us and it is something i have to work on
5163626 we get more and more complaints on motorcyclists driving like that especially the high performance bikes
5163627 he was able to stop his vehicle on the bayway and basically cut off their route of escape
5163628 we figure this is going to be something that is needed for the community
5163629 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5163630 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5163631 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5163632 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5163633 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5163634 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5163635 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5163636 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5163637 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

5163643 a friend of mine introduced me to it i got sold right after he told me that it was cheaper and ive made really good friends through it the server crashing once in a while is a hassle plus the constant disconnections make it a little annoying
5163644 however the main reason why i use it instead of other sites like facebook and mig33 is purely money saving
5163645 i really didnt see the big fuss about it until my young sister whos been using it for a couple years now convinced me that it was a fun alternative to other sites like skype
5163646 i use it for networking and social purposes when im at home with very little airtime and it does not require a pc
5163647 its heartbreaking to see that my sisters children are orphaned while the culprits are roaming the streets

5163682 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5163683 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5163684 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5163689 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5163690 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5163691 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5163692 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5163693 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5163694 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5163695 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5163696 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

5163700 i know im a fringe socceroo but if i can continue to plug away perhaps the rewards will keep coming
5163701 mark had a phone call from the miami heat because their numbers are down and they needed some extra players to train
5163702 in terms of his long term future it was in his best interests to do that
5163703 he asked us if we were okay with it and we are
5163704 it just means he wont get here for another week but he was never a chance to play against melbourne
5163705 bruce might play some minutes on friday night against the tigers
5163706 the games will be a good opportunity for everyone to play decent minutes
5163707 brad is out for a week with a grade one strain of his driver muscle which he did friday
5163708 its more a precaution not to play him at this point of the pre season
5163709 its a good opportunity for the young kids we wont flog mahersy brett maher and you have to remember they wont have chris anstey david barlow or sam mackinnon
5163710 michael clarke and andrew symonds showed they could do the job in the world cup and the recent tour of the west indies so i guess that is the right choice for the time being
5163711 i am not sure if they will go hopefully a decision will be made soon
5163712 if australia does go i am not sure if they will want to take a specialist spinner or stick with what they have been doing
5163713 he played a few games in the west indies his batting has really come on in the past few years and his bowling is going ok
5163714 he is definitely in there as an allround option to go with michael clarke and andrew symonds
5163715 anyone would jump at the opportunity to represent their country if they do pick out a 15th player
5163716 i didnt know james orthwein well but i did share one of my lifes most memorable moments with him and my family back on jan 21 1994 that was the day that i purchased the team stats from mr orthwein
5163717 i have a great black and white photo of the two of us sitting at a table that day with my entire family standing behind us it is a day that i will never forget and a memory that i will always cherish on behalf of my family i would like to extend sympathies to the orthwein family
5163718 from the day i bought the team i have tried to do the right thing
5163719 i accomplished what i set out to do the team and the organization are winners now and the fans will have a lot to cheer about for many years to come
5163720 jim was a private man who thrived as a fisherman outdoorsman and painter
5163721 yet he understood business and he had an enormous talent to see what was important and then connect his product be it candy or cola or beer or the then broken and ridiculed patriot franchise to the public
5163722 of course when youre training your whole life to get to the olympics you train for gold
5163723 but honestly a silver around my neck three times at the olympics means more to me than anything
5163724 i knew izbasa had beaten me in prelims so i was a little more nervous
5163725 i had a little bit of hope inside me but seeing how beautifully she did her routine i knew
5163726 if i go out in public the military will be more than happy to walk with me and tell me to get my butt back to the hotel
5163727 its a little weird when people walk past you and they scream and start crying
5163728 weve all had some experience with that kobe most of all
5163729 fans are passionate we have security with us at the same time were not untouchable we can move around and shake hands
5163730 the average man of the same age needs about 2 000 calories a day but with phelps due to swim 17 times over nine days of competition in beijing he is bringing a whole new spin to the phrase breakfast of champions
5163731 well anyway i was most peeved to have to listen to your call twice when you won caller of the week and the announcer thought you were so onto it but you were wrong

5163734 obviously we were concerned for a while but he came back onto the ground and while he was still limited were hopeful it was just a minor twist and that he might even play next week against the eagles

5163739 by putting her name in nomination youre putting people on the spot
5163740 having a roll call just chews into your broadcast time
5163741 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way
5163742 plamen is a very important part of the team if you have an engine and you take out a piece of that engine you need time for it to start working correctly
5163743 plamen is the right piece of this engine and his return is important for us to get confident before the quarterfinals
5163744 our thoughts and prayers are with the students who were injured and their families as well as chris and his family
5163745 you can phrase it a lot of different ways but we just have to get better up front
5163746 if you dont have a good offensive line you just aint going to be very good period
5163747 ill never be able to get that out of my head i guess you learn to move on and its something you have to live with
5163748 i remember him getting into the car and saying god wants me to go to michigan
5163749 his fathers dream was to watch him play college football and so the first time he comes out of the michigan stadium tunnel and the first hit he takes its going to have a different meaning than it would have
5163750 i dont think its so much that hes putting up a brave front i think hes a brave person i think hes a courageous person and i think hes a faith filled person
5163751 thats going to have a lot of bearing on how we finish this year
5163752 the line has a lot to do with that running game too
5163753 it gives us an opportunity to prove ourselves hopefully those teams will be doing well when we face them
5163754 that way well be able to show the nation what we can do
5163755 do you have last months you can use that you know

5163841 theres no way around it but its a really large project and prices have escalated over the years that figure includes everything construction engineering and legal costs as well as easements for forced mains and pumping stations
5163842 i already spent my 25 000 i dont need a sewer and neither do the rest of the homes in my neighborhood of the 26 homes here i would say all but three have installed new septic systems in the past few years
5163843 there has always been a need for sewer down there and a lot of homeowners have come forward asking for it
5163844 you have high groundwater poor soils and small lots theres a lot of runoff after rainstorms
5163845 last summer we finished the comprehensive wastewater management plan that the state requires we have to demonstrate that we have adequate treatment plant capacity in order to get a permit
5163846 do you want the board of water amp sewer commissioners to pursue construction knowing that the cost may be 31 000
5163847 we dont want people to feel like we are ramming it down their throats
5163848 we want to give them the opportunity to vote yes or no the are different stages and the project will be approved in stages so that everyone has a voice but we cant save this capacity for ever if they turn this down there are other areas in town that also need service
5163849 im not really for the union im happy with the way things are here
5163850 whenever you get any small issue you get a group of people yelling out there thats not right
5163851 we dont have an incentive for people to stay poor not zero sum their gains as they move up do not come at our expense china fear that they will catch up so we will fall behind untrue china has improved its standard of living is by selling us stuff they can make more cheaply than we can which is good for both of us chinas success increases our success improves our lives

5163858 we did the audit with rise engineering some time ago and at that time renovating town hall electrically would have the biggest bang for the buck

5163869 this is a gesture to abu mazen and the palestinian people for the upcoming month of ramadan

5163872 we ask israeli to change its conditions for releasing prisoners and we ask for the release of all prisoners without exception
5163873 let me around the wife and the kids and i will let you know
5163874 does having to evaluate or examine a persons belief system seem counter to the way the holy spirit works
5163875 i am the way and the truth and the life
5163876 there really are no words i could stand up here all day long and try to explain it but its been a gift of a year weve been together for five years and this year has been the most dominant that weve ever been its just an awesome car and it hasnt been one of those cars thats run a tenth faster than everyone that final there it was a tenth of a second good race the driver had to do his job and i think im driving good because its tight racing its constant suck it up moments
5163877 theyre going to take all the points away and im going to show up at the last race and try and win the race if someone else wins the championship im going to walk over there and shake their hand we know the rules we read the rulebook i knew coming in that if we won every race coming up here they were going to take all the points away weve been doing it this way for a year now and im not going to be a hypocrite and say it was only good last year because it helped us as good as were running if we cant close the deal at the end of the year so be it and someone else is going to be the powerade champ we have a great team no matter what happens if we didnt show up at the last six races we still have had a great season
5163878 its nice to be able to redeem yourself in a seven day period
5163879 its funny hawley comes up to me before the final and says jack i want you to completely get out of your mind what happened last weekend dont even think about that i said frank we dont teach mind games at the school were not supposed to be doing that
5163880 imagine being a little league player and you get to pitch against mickey mantle frank hawley has been all of that to the sport to have him come back in adds a whole other dimension to this and hell no i wasnt going to cut him any slack
5163881 like the last thing we needed was another tough funny car i was so happy for him when he won his rounds and he was happy for me all the way up to the final round so that was cool it was just a fairy tale weekend it really was
5163882 closing out a spot in the top 10 is good
5163883 we go into indy a little bit more relaxed the crew gave me such a great consistent race car a couple of times it wanted to move over toward the centerline but it was a pretty smooth car all weekend long we just stunk in the middle part of the season nine races without a round win we had to kind of take a couple of steps backward to kind of start picking away at this weve been consistent for a few races now i think were starting to get quick and i think if we can take that into cold weather tracks we will be contending for the championship
5163884 we did a good job today but we were also pretty fortunate you dont expect kurt johnson and dave connolly to go red against you but well take it
5163885 our car was struggling we qualified 11th and we knew wed have out work cut out for us
5163886 we need to carry this momentum into the countdown indy is the biggest race of the year no question about it but come charlotte the inaugural nhra carolinas nationals race sept 11 14 were running for the powerade world championship and we want to win a fifth championship weve got all the ingredients to make that happen even against the likes of allen johnson kb racing and warren johnson and that group were poised and were ready to fire were getting that look back in our eye
5163887 we got over our tranny problems shifting that we had on saturday
5163888 the ghost is not a weapon its a way of life
5163889 if in other sciences we should arrive at certainty without doubt and truth without error it behooves us to place the foundations of knowledge in mathematics
5163890 people who directly and indirectly supported the coup were appointed as members of organizations responsible for taking action against me
5163891 jag kan inte klaga alltf r mycket det r inte resultatet vi ville ha men med tanke p ndringarna jag var tvungen att g ra r det ber mv rt vi var det b ttre laget n r det g ller bollinnehav och tryck men vi utnyttjade det inte i den andra halvleken

5163897 oxfam fits very well in the middle of this changing attitude in the uk about values

5163901 desarmar a la generalitat valenciana que ha abierto una grieta en el frente cl sico
5163902 lo que ser a terrible es que el psc se supeditara a los intereses del psoe y de hecho el psoe lo intenta forzando reuniones de barones para convencer al presidente de la generalitat pero no le ha salido bien
5163903 una reuni n de ese tipo no va a generar tensi n por el contrario puede ser un mbito que resulte positivo

5163911 lenovo has provided ideapad and other notebook pcs and video cameras to more than 100 athletes from more than 25 countries and 29 sports who are participating in the program their blogs are presented on the website www lenovo com voicesofthegames to date there have been 1 374 athlete postings on the forum reaching more than 8 5 million olympic fans through conversations on third party blogs and social media sites
5163912 the lenovo voice of the summer olympics is not going to be measured by the web 1 0 metrics of millions and million of impressions but by the web 2 0 measure of thousands and thousands of conversations between athletes and their fans
5163913 gets to travel all over the world and stab people with swords
5163914 the deceased was on top of the ice cornice and was warned by his brother that it was unsafe and he attempted to get off the ice cornice and it collapsed underneath him
5163915 its been a good season weve had good snow and good crowds up here and this is the first incident weve had
5163916 people should be aware that these ice cornices can be unstable and if youre unsure of your ability to ski in certain areas then dont do it
5163917 its unusual for three people to die in one day and we heard they were experienced people too so were putting safety first we always do
5163918 the ski patrols and the medical centre staff were on the site of the accidents very quickly and they reacted the way we want them to
5163919 at the end of the day skiing is not a particularly dangerous activity and it is rare to have a fatality
5163920 the two men who hit trees they hit them in the wrong spot
5163921 youve only got to look at their tv ads because if you advertise wild times at these resorts then youre going to get people doing wild things
5163922 there seems to be a lack of emphasis on education on getting lessons on safety
5163923 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
5163924 the happiest people dont necessarily have the best of everything they just
5163925 americans from all walks of life from across the country
5163926 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
5163927 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
5163928 from his background he has a deep understanding of what american families face
5163929 one of my favorite people of all time is ms
5163930 so i wish all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate just the joy of being able to stand up and say that in front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge
5163931 and hed be like man the pizza is good today
5163932 i just wanted to make sure i took every single moment in and every single swim in every single moment with my teammates so i would remember them
5163933 to swim in the same era as him has been awesome
5163934 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5163935 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5163936 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5163937 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5163938 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5163939 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5163940 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5163941 hes more naturally suited for longer distances itll be change for him but i think itll be a good one
5163942 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5163943 im not supposed to give out boxes but its for the baby right ill see what i can find
5163944 yeah i want those curtains that like block the light out i guess
5163945 these are all blackouts let me know if you need anything else
5163946 made it clear we wouldnt be leaving until we signed
5163947 ive emailed for a price and will report back once ive gotten one
5163948 oh wow want did you email them for a price with the monitor and the controls and the cabinet and
5163949 i think robs point is an important one lithium and nimh batteries are a pretty decent amount of en
5163950 maybe you could hit him with your keyboard you sure do look brave when youre holding it you know
5163951 good job sixpoints very well stated szab has designed something truly amazing we will no doubt
5163952 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5163953 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5163954 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5163955 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5163956 and they threaten you they say if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5163957 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5163958 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5163959 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5163960 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5163961 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5163962 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing
5163963 they know they can keep doing what theyre doing because they can get away with it
5163964 theyre not getting punished and states arent doing more because they know regulators wont do a thing
5163965 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5163966 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5163967 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5163968 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5163969 good position to work with and others on the problem
5163970 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5163971 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5163972 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5163973 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5163974 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5163975 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5163976 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5163977 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5163978 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5163979 is an art space specifically opened up with the intention of giving new artists the opportunity to show their work as a lesbian artist myself i am interested to see other lesbian perspectives the repertoire of individual responses by different lesbians to the same stimuli is what we are keen to see and show why this painting you ask simply because some years ago as a young twenty something leafing through an art book in my lesbian london share house this one caught my eye i mean what is that nipple tweak about
5163980 but the sal on is much more than an art gallery
5163981 already weve had several musical ensembles use the space as a rehearsal venue from highly trained professionals such as the song company and cellist sally maer aka cello diva to local queer chamber choir door in the wall and the sydney pop choir both of whom i direct the music here is acoustic in the real sense theres not a microphone or an amplifier in sight in fact id be quite happy with just candlelight
5163982 why not turn this room into a dim sum restaurant
5163983 how many dumps did i have to take today i took a lot of dumps today
5163984 i hired a campaign manager to win the servant towel award people like that dont deserve to win it
5163985 however in hindsight i think it might have been better to have told him in front of john macarthur so that dad would just say grace to you
5163986 he told me look we wont be remembering this at your thirtieth wedding anniversary
5163987 of course i start to breathe after somebody passed gas
5163988 jeesh just told a story about being hit on by an old lady
5163989 im like a fountain of wit or the fertilizer of said fountain
5163990 holy crap we lost 99 48 in the season opener i see they stopped worrying about updating the score list
5163991 do you enjoy making people feel retarded you behave like that is your job in life
5163992 stephen sounds so smart when hes on the phone what happens when he hangs up
5163993 if you were mooned while you were marooned you would be a mooned marooned moon
5163994 hey thrower thrower thrower hey thrower thrower thrower huck thrower huck huck thrower huck
5163995 well youre her boss and shes your your your whatever
5163996 its hard to fill a gas tank on the shoulder of the interstate in 4 inch heels while someone is mocking you with a camera but thats what happens when you dont think the gas gauge really means it yet
5163997 its been a while since i took geometry its been even longer since you took geometry
5163998 you know what else is strange looking at a total stranger who looks totally familiar then comparing life stories only to realize that you are the only common link it was six degrees of john letoto and it was hilariously awkward i think its fair to say we both blame your camera
5163999 ill be away from my desk invoking a john maneuver
5164000 there are limits on what i will forge for you mr letoto
5164001 the three worst words in the english language as a brother
5164002 its her boyfriends car actually im a creep arent i
5164003 aaahhh the wisdom five sisters impart i still get my kicks but i dont get kicked
5164004 yup i get all dressed up to go to the grocery store or city hall or whatever its kinda funny if id done that during seminary id probably be married to a preacher boy right now whew that was a close call
5164005 johns a little coffee press strong and brown here is his handle here is his frown
5164006 being older and still single makes you more single more single than say katie mohler
5164007 were talking about logic and about the law of non contradiction in worldviews and im pretty sure theres a law that says if theres food being given away and letoto is present then letoto is eating
5164008 yeah the pee phrase kept coming out of order something about how he peed in worship it confused me
5164009 i like how we just had an extended conversation about ryans buttocks actually i dont really like that
5164010 thats hawaiian harassment and i dont have to stand for it
5164011 shipping will be extra to hawaii alaska or any of the other non contiguous u s states
5164012 in some northern countries they can use their watches to tell the time
5164013 they never know whether to come out the front or the back
5164014 tell me if taryns had any reading books about boys with muscles moments lately
5164015 i will be back tuesday im looking forward to my spanking
5164016 she was bigger so she was able to do stuff no she wasnt big boned she was hispanic
5164017 more liquid in your system makes the boogers come out faster
5164018 its like my car was trying to do a yoga pose my car was doing a headstand in a ditch
5164019 the first step is admitting you have a problem the first step is admitting im a stupid haole
5164020 im wondering how lucrative my five star hotel will be on mount doom
5164021 actually what i was thinking was i wish tina crouse was a couple years older
5164022 hes already got a girl it aint like she cant see hes fat
5164023 yes christopher god will even raise you from the dung of a polar bear
5164024 toto the kermit analogy fails because in this picture kermit is actually with a woman
5164025 taryn walker sarah alliett and one more big one i cant think of
5164026 i mean are people thinking itll up their chances of winning the servant towel award by taking me or something
5164027 im not a liar i just bend the truth without realizing it thats all
5164028 oh my arm pits are sweaty theyre sticky and i dont like it at all
5164029 ive been married for five years and i think the gospels way easier to understand
5164030 one girl six locations that means shes either got a really active social life or shes just fat
5164031 you know what the worst game to play with my family is monopoly try getting a whole bunch of jewish people together and see how that turns out
5164032 they asked you if you needed a nudge after they jostled you
5164033 you know what i cant understand people who come here to work out and take the elevator
5164034 but if there was no jesus we would worship you
5164035 shocking the glutes did i just say something about his butt
5164036 you know the partys gone south when you start singing twila paris on karaoke

5164038 im going to get ready and ask my wife do i look all right
5164039 i wake up each morning and think what would letoto wear and i put on lots of flannel

5164041 so for me once theyre out of the minor stage i can go for the young ones
5164042 i pulled an sbts and used a bunch of your pictures without asking only it was on our blog not a magazine thanks

5164047 oh no i just remembered i didnt flush their toilet this morning
5164048 when she was pushing and i saw the head coming out i thought to myself itll be a miracle if she ever walks again

5164050 i was trying to remember did i forget or did i never know
5164051 what do you mean were going to be a big bump on the skin

5164053 you know what i want to see you pull off a jacket with boardshorts
5164054 it seemed like it was something that wasnt widely understood or maybe that was just because i was talking to sean malinger
5164055 and i didnt get stuck out the window i was trying to see the stars
5164056 the only thing thats running through my head right now is that i really hope i dont fart

5164064 huh wow well it does bring to mind that sermon dr york preached toward the beginning of the semester and in a not so abstract sense you may have hit the skin on the head

5164171 has mccain told this story anywhere else before perhaps in his book
5164172 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5164173 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5164174 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5164175 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5164176 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5164177 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5164178 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5164179 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5164180 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there
5164181 the same answer would be toward this situation as soon as we are assured that georgians will not continue to use military force against south ossetians and against abkhazians
5164182 some of these things come back right away and theyre ready to go a lot of players play with these things
5164183 we have to realize that it isnt just antivirals that we need
5164184 we need to make sure that were prepared to treat people with antibiotics
5164185 certainly the idea that resident bacteria flora already present could play a role in developing pneumonia is relatively reasonable
5164186 if the 1918 flu had any impact that compromised immune function it could render a normal resident bacteria pathological
5164187 were hoping to get cctv footage of the card being used at that location so we can prove who was in possession of it at the time
5164188 at this point theres nothing to suggest the person who used the card was anyone other than the deceased as there was money and the card in his wallet which was in his pocket when he was recovered from the water in the viaduct
5164189 while the past six weeks have been incredibly difficult and they have been incredibly frustrating watching this entire saga play out in the public i can honestly say i am absolutely relieved now that there is clarity going forward and i now know what i am up against
5164190 while i am shocked and also saddened that it has got this far in terms of all the allegations and the charges i am more determined than ever to fight to clear my name
5164191 i now look forward to every chance and every possibility for all information and all of the facts to be played out in the appropriate forum
5164192 there are two sides to every story and i guarantee that both will come out in the end
5164193 a man may deal with theory and miss the whole impact of the truth
5164194 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5164195 people used to say about natalie but she doesnt swim fast enough
5164196 certainly theres an aspect of water polo where swimming is important and speed can come into play but its also about understanding the game and positioning
5164197 in water polo in our country i believe we put too much emphasis on the swimming in water polo 60 to 70 of the game is played vertically youre only horizontal or swimming about 30 of the time
5164198 sometimes i joke that im still learning how to swim i used to have like an anchor attached to my leg but im faster now
5164199 the first time i was just kind of happy to be there along for the ride filling my role
5164200 this time im a starter and i have more responsibility and i think ive grown as a player i feel like im a lot better than i was four years ago
5164201 i think this is the first tournament in my entire life where ive actually been totally confident its been a lot of fun playing and competing
5164202 its the opportunity its the fact that im standing here right now i just got to play in that arena in front of all those people waving flags my family gets to travel my brother gets to come watch his older sister play in the olympics thats the cool thing the things you can talk about when youre older the things you can give to your kids when youre older

5164213 i think it speaks volumes if they are not prepared to come and be accountable to forum leaders but obviously we are going to await formal advice as to whether they are coming or not
5164214 sometimes something like that happening can change the internal dynamic at home
5164215 my assessment is that leaders feel that the events in fiji are really casting a stain on the pacific the leaders want to be seen and have the forum be seen to continue to be leading international opinion and action on the issue
5164216 so its going to be taken very seriously whether or not the commodore is there

5164256 la afici n me llega desde peque o desde que un d a pas delante del televisor cuando mi abuelo estaba viendo una corrida y me llam mucho la atenci n despu s l gicamente se dieron otras circunstancias para que yo entrara en este mundo siempre por afici n eso s pero aquel fue el primer contacto no recuerdo qui n toreaba ese d a en la tele pero s me acuerdo de que la primera vez que fui a una plaza toreaban joselito enrique ponce y jos tom s y esa corrida fue la que me termin de enganchar despu s el toreo es una forma de vida m s que una profesi n hay profesiones en las que apartas la vida privada la personal de la profesional pero en sta no sta te involucra mucho y hace que todo gire en torno a ella por eso es distinta a las dem s
5164257 el miedo es algo que est ah que nace contigo lo que hacemos nosotros es que somos capaces de trag rnoslo y enfrentarnos a l y ese miedo se supera s lo dando siempre un paso adelante teniendo muy claro lo que vas a hacer estando muy seguro confiando en ti y estando dispuesto a arriesgar y a lo que sea el miedo te lleva a una situaci n en la que no se pondr a casi nadie el valor es precisamente tragarse el miedo y ser consciente de que te puede pasar algo pero lo asumes y te pones ah y gracias a tus conocimientos lo intentas llevar mejor
5164258 la sensaci n de cuajar un toro dura poquito son apenas 10 minutos lo que viene despu s es como una especie de nube en la que te sumerges pero lo bonito es cuando est s delante del toro lo cuajas y hay una comunicaci n con l hay faenas con algunos toros en las que est s completamente abandonado y pr cticamente es como si estuvieras toreando de sal n el toreo tiene muchas cosas bonitas y muchas muy duras pero esos momentos de compenetraci n con el animal son al final la recompensa a todo
5164259 la familia es la que te ha echado para adelante la que te ha dado de comer cuando no pod as subsistir por ti mismo pero se vive para ser importante uno y para ser figura del toreo la familia no puede ser algo que te ate tienes que tener capacidad de abandonar todo lo que pueda atarte a la vida y para ser torero tienes que tener valor para eso tambi n para poder vivir sin algo que realmente necesitas yo cuando toreo no sufro por nadie soy muy ego sta y me gusta vivir yo las sensaciones y no me preocupo realmente por quien hay fuera no me acuerdo de nadie despu s de la corrida eso s mi primera llamada es para mi hermano o para un amigo y despu s s llamo a mi madre
5164260 el toro es un animal al que amo y respeto y sobre todo conozco muy bien mejor que otras personas que creen defenderlo mejor de lo que lo defiendo yo convivo casi todos los d as del a o con l me s todas sus reacciones y eso hace que me sienta muy identificado con l la muerte del toro hay que entenderla como la vida misma todo acaba as todo tiene un principio y un fin todo acaba igual como acabamos todos la representaci n es as y adem s algo tan fuerte como es el toreo tiene que acabar de esa manera no puede terminar de otra forma
5164261 el d a que toreas los momentos duros van por rachas el miedo va y viene en los momentos de soledad de la habitaci n siempre piensas que puede pasar algo que te puedes equivocar t o se puede equivocar el toro pero lo normal es pensar en positivo eso es lo que te da fuerzas para vestirte y pensar en disfrutar cuando est s en una habitaci n y sabes que tienes cualidades que puedes dominar al animal eso es de lo m s bonito que existe tienes un miedo esc nico y un miedo f sico pero no te puede
5164262 el torero necesita la soledad para vivir adem s muchas veces cuando est s rodeado de gente te sientes solo entiendo que tambi n es dif cil pedirle a alguien que te comprenda por eso hay ocasiones en las que aunque est s con gente hablando y ri ndote por dentro hay un vac o interior que es lo que te provoca la soledad pero se aprende a vivir con eso cada uno lo lleva como puede pero debo reconocer que m no me disgusta esa soledad es una forma de buscar el equilibro para mantener todo ordenado y saber lo que quieres
5164263 cuando las cosas salen bien y todo el mundo te alaba es bueno saber que haces algo distinto y que lo llevas dentro pero tampoco hay que creerse nada el que es grande no llega nunca a creerse nada y no est re ido el creerte algo con el seguir evolucionando lo que s es cierto es que lo mejor del toreo es el toro y lo peor la mentira como en todas partes ste es un mundo en el que se mueven masas y dinero y por lo tanto hay mentiras como en todos sitios pero aqu sobran porque si el toreo es distinto tiene que ser distinto para todo la verdad del toreo est en el ruedo de barreras para dentro

5164268 we are going to saturate the market because we are looking for customer convenience
5164269 we believe that there is room out there for everyone
5164270 if this is a krispy kreme hometown why would they only have one retail store
5164271 if anything it might be a blow to the pride of krispy to have so many dunkins locally
5164272 krispy kremes problem continues to be in large part that it doesnt have enough outlets convenient enough to buy doughnuts and coffee coffee is an extremely convenience based business

5164278 in 1946 it was sitting in schenectady n y then it was sold with 90 others to canada canada kept them for 10 years and then sold them to the portuguese government where they sat until in 1982 southern parts in georgia imported them as scrap
5164279 i consulted on the set design for the film flags of our fathers and we provided all the gun mounts for the hbo series the pacific
5164280 i think i filled a much needed spot in the group
5164281 these guys will come over with tears in their eyes and the memories all come back
5164282 their children tell us that they have never talked about the war before what people dont understand is that these vehicles were their homes and their weapons and everything they possessed was inside them their stories are an invaluable piece of history
5164283 weve got to find bigger locations with parking wed like to get back there but not exactly like wareham this would probably be a clearance center we were close on a couple of things that havent materialized hopefully in the next year or so something will meet the criteria
5164284 its a metal frame building thats landscaped and well lit to have a department store feel
5164285 it will have an 18 000 to 19 000 square foot retail area and a 3 000 to 4 000 square foot processing area
5164286 over 125 years this is how we supported the ministry and rehabilitated lives
5164287 now theres so much competition in the recycling market its harder to raise funds our rehab centers are not government funded but are completely self sufficient from donations and marketing those donations the highest return on recycling is retail
5164288 we have to collect well sort well and retail well in an effort to play catchup with the world we have to go from older downtown locations we have to have a place big enough to draw enough traffic to support the rehab centers
5164289 were trying to draw people to us and get rid of the stigma of going to the salvation army stores
5164290 our competition has savvy operators you go in there and theyre very upscale twenty years ago there wasnt the resale market there is now in the last 20 years over 22 000 thrift shops have opened and most are for profit stores that are slick shiny and well lit to compete we have to do the same

5164293 what were seeing is a greater incidence of type 2 diabetes in the younger population
5164294 we never used to see type 2 until late adulthood there are a lot more overweight children and adolescents nowadays
5164295 with our economy the way it is it wouldnt surprise me if people started making cheaper less healthy food choices
5164296 but the hopeful side of the equation is that people can make meals that are both healthy and economical
5164297 the more processed it gets the less healthy it gets
5164298 how could he do that how could he cheat on his wife who has cancer

5164304 mens shirts are beautiful and well designed the collar can be frayed but the rest of the shirt has years left in it
5164305 i wanted to use something that would show elements of what it was before
5164306 her stuff was quality and the idea of green fashion is in keeping with the consignment shop idea
5164307 a lot of people have come in and asked to have similar items made in their sizes

5164311 weve been doing this at least once or twice a year since ive been the chief 2000 and this is the first time we didnt catch someone
5164312 we have to post publicly that were going to do this
5164313 each january in the local papers we tell the people that well be doing this during the year so its not like they dont know were going to do it
5164314 weve maintained the same guidelines that the abcc puts out and we adopted in 2000 if we catch anyone and bring them before the selectmen their license could be suspended or revoked any appeal of that action goes to the abcc and the commissioners there will see that we follow the guidelines
5164315 there was one establishment we caught in the past and they are really working with us the most theyve done a decent job bringing up their diligence
5164316 sometimes the establishment gets really busy we saw on a video that they were busy and an older lady working looked and checked the license there was a line behind the customer and the clerk was reading it fast they always card and the video showed her carding the person she just didnt calculate it correctly

5164337 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5164338 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5164339 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5164340 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5164341 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5164342 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5164343 there has to be effective enforcement of some sort there has to be reality to it

5164417 trustworthiness is the very first thing that we decide about a person and once weve decided we do all kinds of elaborate gymnastics to believe in people
5164418 the default is trust until theres a reason not to
5164419 we had made a decision how we were going to start the first two games and thats about as far as weve gone
5164420 we didnt play good as an offense as a whole
5164421 im not really pleased with what many of our offensive guys did early we didnt get a lot done rex was a part of that
5164422 as an offense we didnt play well but rex is a part of that
5164423 thats kind of how it goes sometimes you still want someone to step up and make a play but we didnt really have a lot of opportunities
5164424 that one drive at the end of the half was encouraging
5164425 but beyond that we didnt get our running game going 51 yards on 20 carries and got in a hole right away with penalties
5164426 smith hasnt told me anything ill just try to go back to work this week and get better
5164427 whenever he smith tells me to play i go in and play
5164428 weve got to go out and do a better job of trying to protect him
5164429 they called my number and i was able to get open and caleb put it up there
5164430 youre a lot taller if you reach with one arm so thats kind of how it went just a reaction trying to get up there and make a play
5164431 i just want more opportunities and hopefully going out there and playing well saturday night will help further that
5164432 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5164433 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5164434 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5164435 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5164436 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5164437 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5164438 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5164439 i dont know anyone out there who would get tired of playing with venus williams
5164440 we were really focused from the first point we really wanted to win
5164441 we feel like weve contributed to our country in a huge way thats really what its all about
5164442 le but monter la plus classe des boutiques de produits from tokyo
5164443 we looked up at the board and there were a lot of zeros up there with one big 8 and we added 1 in the eighth
5164444 it was a grind mentally and physically to bear down and make pitches
5164445 i just felt deep down inside that if i could just keep them there somehow keep them from scoring any more runs that wed have a chance to come back and win it and not let it get out of hand
5164446 we had some guys on and we just werent able to cash in
5164447 that was the difference today we were able to get those guys in sori gets a big hit ramy gets a big hit when we get those guys rolling were pretty tough to beat
5164448 i feel like im getting away with pitches i wasnt necessarily getting away with then just because stuff wise my fastballs got good life on it my slider and my splitter are both pitches im able to throw for strikes and also to strike guys out
5164449 its easy to sit in your chair and pump your chest out and not continue to work hard ultimately it comes down to your next start
5164450 theres a lot of people i still care about here in the bay area
5164451 i love coming back to stanford although i didnt have a chance to go back this trip the bay area is familiar to me and i always liked the bay area
5164452 when i get that many runs i think just throw strikes and be aggressive
5164453 everything was working with that many runs just continue to pound the strike zone
5164454 every time we come here we get some crazy games
5164455 we start out good with the uribe home run and we took advantage of the guy not throwing strikes he was all over the place and when he tried to find the plate we didnt miss them
5164456 i was trying to do too much trying to be very detailed on every pitch and i let it get the best of me
5164457 we have a very good team in all aspects of the game
5164458 we can play defense hit and pitch and our bullpen is very good i think were doing a good job of bringing the same effort level every day
5164459 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5164460 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5164461 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5164462 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5164463 the selectors and lawson exchanged hot words and there was plenty of drama when they sat down to finalise the squad for the champions trophy last week
5164464 this is not the first time the selectors have had problems with lawson and this time they want the board chairman to take some action
5164465 sie haben eine gute serie gesegelt und hatten sicher auch das notwendige gl ck f r uns ist die farbe der medaille egal wir freuen uns ber bronze
5164466 we will study the notice and then take appropriate action
5164467 he feels this is another attempt by some people in the board to cause him mental anguish and try to disturb his preparations for the tournament
5164468 i was so unhappy about their marriage he works so hard for his money and deserves a wonderful wife not this woman whos always been bossy and just wanted her own way

5164474 plamen is the right piece of this engine and his return is important for us to get confident before the quarterfinals
5164475 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5164477 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5164478 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5164479 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5164480 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5164481 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5164482 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5164483 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5164484 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5164485 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5164486 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5164487 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5164488 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5164489 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5164490 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5164491 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5164492 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5164493 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5164494 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5164495 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year

5164511 our quarterly economic forecast highlights a significant worsening in uk economic prospects there is now a distinct possibility of technical recession the level of uk unemployment is likely to increase to nearly 300 000 over the next few years reaching almost two million an increase above two million cannot be ruled out
5164512 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5164513 the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession
5164514 whilst a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate

5164517 londoners have so far been largely insulated from the price falls taking place elsewhere in the country
5164518 however sellers who choose to come to the market during the peak holiday season generally have a greater need to sell and as a result properties coming onto the market in july were on average 21 000 cheaper than last month
5164519 areas that are about to benefit from improved transport links appear to be avoiding the worst of the storm that is setting in elsewhere in the capital
5164520 when looking at trends in the market it is important to remember that uk house prices are significantly higher than five years ago
5164521 the current issue affecting the market is largely about the supply of credit a very different situation to the early 90s which was about high interest rates and

5164531 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5164532 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5164533 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5164534 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now

5164537 it the aircraft had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry it was approximately two miles from the runway
5164538 we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft which was also hoping to land at coventry

5164544 for me it was a chance to make an entire dvd from the ground up
5164545 ive loved animation since i was a kid particularly the warner bros shorts road runner was my favorite
5164546 but the trouble is i cant draw very well so i never really considered animation as a career fortunately technology came to the rescue
5164547 even the minutest crumbs of visual stimulation to that radio show audience were like puff pastry offered to starving prisoners
5164548 i founded twinkle so i could combine my interest in technology with my love of cartooning
5164549 id take artwork by my favorite comic book artists doug allen charles burns kim deitch dan clowes peter bagge lane smith chris ware cut it apart then reassemble the pieces as digital puppets for animation in flash
5164550 chris told ira we were the ones to do it
5164551 several times a year one of us will say oh that would be a fun thing to do and next thing you know youre up for four nights in a row it was very much in that model
5164552 we like to add something listeners cant get free just listening to the radio
5164553 i mean a radio show is the most static stage presentation possible and its kind of embarrassing to sell tickets just to hear someone read a script
5164554 i wanted to do the thing with ira but i didnt want to travel or meet anyone new and since i already knew tim and the sullivan buildings were in my own city and the topic was about old stuff i really like to draw it was perfect
5164555 this project is a tiny piece in todays growing interest in preserving the beauty and eloquence of turn of the century architecture
5164556 the performance is cool because its a collaboration between two masters of their particular mediums
5164557 so if you werent lucky enough to see them perform it live the dvd is the closest thing to it
5164558 the visual component was a surprise to the live audiences
5164559 people thought they were coming to listen to a regular this american life episode they didnt know theyd be seeing anything other than a couple of guys reading on a stage
5164560 even the minutest crumbs of visual stimulation to that radio show audience were like puff pastry offered to starving prisoners
5164561 i wanted it to feel more movie ish and less like a video presentation
5164562 ira is a radio guy so hes great on audio but he wasnt real clear on working with video
5164563 and hes not exactly a computer whiz still he got final cut express and he laid down all the slides and did the transitions and timing to create a rough cut for the dvd for a guy who had never touched the software to more or less put the thing together as you see it now thats pretty impressive
5164564 if i made a mistake and thousands of angry pri listeners sent back their dvds it would be my fault as far as i know no one has
5164565 aside from our own twinkle reels lost buildings is only the second dvd ive ever made
5164566 for me it was a chance to make an entire dvd from the ground up encoding menu design animation extra features and then have the files i made sent off to the mastering facility
5164567 if i made a mistake and thousands of angry pri listeners sent back their dvds it would be my fault
5164568 the artwork looked great the way they had it on stage blown up huge on a big screen but it would have been terrible on a computer or tv screen due to the limits of ntsc
5164569 i wanted it to feel more movie ish and less like a video presentation
5164570 but the fatal flaw was that chris designed the slides as tall rectangles or what i came to refer to as narrowscreen
5164571 this meant that some of the smaller images would be hard to see even on the biggest tv but the relative sizes and positions of the images were integral to chris storytelling so i made a second version of the slide show that blew up the images to full frame for those who want a closer look
5164572 and i find that most dvd menus are done by people who couldnt care less they never even saw the movie they just hack it out by the standard format
5164573 that allowed us to be unconventional with the menus themselves without baffling the viewer
5164574 there are a few labels but theyre mostly based around icons that chris and i chose
5164575 and the further you get into the extras the fewer labels there are
5164576 i figure that those who are interested enough to check out the extras will be willing to puzzle it out
5164577 if you look closely youll see that the icons on the main menu page are colored
5164578 but when you go to the first extras menu the icons are just chriss inks and on the second extras menu theyre pencil sketches its kind of a continuous deconstruction of his artwork that was my genius idea
5164579 chris is a bit of a curmudgeon to work with
5164580 he had so many revisions i had to update the images and redo the file six times then we had new files for timing and for audio it seemed never ending
5164581 there are two pauses in the dvd that i thought would end our friendship we had to process them like a married couple id say i know you feel its better to put the pause in here but i think you want to hold on this other moment here because thats where the feeling comes and hed argue and id say dont you think thats my area of expertise seeing as i work in a time based medium and you dont oh it was very bitter
5164582 it was great and really easy to work with john and the dvd is crazily beautiful
5164583 it was a huge draw and its hard to pitch i mean we do plenty of stories that have mass appeal but frankly this isnt one of them who cares about this stuff architecture geeks fans of pledge drive radio but we get 1 6 million people listening to our show every week and i guess its a curiosity for them to see what its like when we do something with images while keeping the style of the radio show
5164584 the most exciting thing for me is that you can design a full retail quality dvd on a single computer i consider it groundbreaking that you can do all that on your mac
5164585 the most exciting thing for me is that you can design a full retail quality dvd on a single computer
5164586 i consider it groundbreaking that you can do all that on your mac
5164587 and as someone who watches a lot of dvds i know what i want out of that if you do it right with the way you introduce it do the menus get into the features and the movie itself you can add to the effect of the film itself
5164588 there are plenty of great movies that do nothing with the dvd but for me its an opportunity to encode it and fiddle with it and decide how to surround it and that lets me create a new experience of it for people
5164589 i have a piece of tissue that looks like a spinal disc a sand bag tough as nails on the outside and like sand on the inside
5164590 in a month the torn tissue will be completely regrown and healed
5164591 i wish i could have had a procedure like this
5164592 this will lead to human treatments but they cant move as fast as we can
5164593 after a few weeks of lab growth it will turn into something that resembles a tendon but it has to be the mechanical equivalent and we dont know that were there
5164594 stem cells are very promising but what they do for horses may not work so well for humans because humans are the hardest animal to rebuild
5164595 often that injury is a complete tear the ligament is snapped in two and the ends ball up and even if you untangle them and pull them together they wont heal
5164596 so they take part of the patella tendon which is short and tough and stretch it and staple it to the bones so not only is your acl not working too well and you have to stretch it out but your knee hurts like crazy
5164597 if we can learn to grow a tendon that works right or figure out how to make the acl heal back together we can save a lot of people a lot of pain
5164598 the body knows how to heal itself were speeding up and concentrating the process
5164599 ninety three percent got better with a single injection and stayed better for two years
5164600 i will guess that five years from now insurance companies wont authorize surgery until the patient has tried and failed at prp
5164601 we dont always know how stem cells when injected into some tissues work their magic
5164602 veterinarians dont go back and study the horses tendons to figure out what the stem cells did to promote healing
5164603 there are all kinds of ways stem cells could work if we could understand how they are actually promoting better function of the tissue we might be able to further improve their therapeutic effects
5164604 youre putting in cells that want to grow that has to be under control
5164605 theres a nagging feeling that theres a cancer stem cell that when its agitated by exposure to carcinogens or radiation or something it goes nuts and that we cant identify it from the other stem cells

5164647 the arrival of western product in the early 90s came courtesy of saw gashed cds excess stock and deleted titles from western majors attempting to avoid taxation and disposal costs these cds had their cases cut to mark them as defective and were then shipped in to china through free market economic ports like guangzhou only to end up on the black market an end result that can be seen as a partial shooting in the foot for the western majors who then had to come in and fight against the pirate networks they inadvertently helped set up

5164686 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5164687 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5164688 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5164689 the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses than just a week and a half or two weeks ago so there are already consequences
5164690 i think they may not appreciate the magnitude of those consequences yet the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be

5164699 how the site used to work is completely different than how it works now
5164700 now theres sort of and this is a credit to digg from my perspective its harder and harder to predict what stories will go to the front page it used to be based on the numbers alone like if a story has 150 diggs itd go to the front page in the past it did feel like you were able to not control necessarily you could leverage power over your submission to get to the front page and thats harder and harder now
5164701 i speak to most of them and know them personally i talk to them on the phone its a network we all speak to each other all the people who get five or six stories a month on the front page we see each other on im and say hello to one another
5164702 if you have good content and not the networking if you dont know how to optimize content then theres no way to get to the front page unless you happen to be really lucky
5164703 while you need to first find an interesting article digg gives you that power to sell it if you dont have the power to sell it then its not going to make it to the front page im not saying that only power users are successful because there must be 5 000 to 10 000 people who can get a front page article its just that you have to sell the article and if you dont its not going to make it
5164704 i digg friends articles i do think it works both ways if you find yourself removed it is because you didnt digg me or werent around for awhile digg me and i will add you back freedom of speech is best and agree to disagree is my policy
5164705 my brother mark cuban is attempting to purchase the chicago cubs so i have been gravitating to stories about that
5164706 i generally come across those links in the chicago tribune since those will be the freshest and most relevant on the subject i feel stories on the cubs pending sale are of national interest to the digg sports community the digg community has confirmed this all but 1 of my submissions on this subject have gone front page
5164707 i think a lot of it is wives tales and it is certainly all speculation
5164708 the digg community is so large that i think it would take a very concerted effort of lots of diggers to bury a story that would otherwise have national interest i think a lot of stories that you would not think would appeal to the masses make it though artificially because people just do not care about the subject matter enough to take a positive or negative interest in it and it slides through this happens a lot with videos if the subject matter touches a nerve on some level people will respond one way or the other as along as there are algorithms there will be mit math geeks who crack them and figure out how to beat them i think it is a good thing that people probe for weakness that leads to improvement and innovation
5164709 heres the secret want to your stories to be popular and go to the front page blind digg blind digg everything the power users submit youll get there soon its a gross and disturbing display digg is a mere shadow of its former glory
5164710 its 4chan its lolcats its goat fucking stories its 12 year old bathroom humor that will make you king of the frontpage
5164711 some great obscure content there if you know where to look but its buried deep in the site i keep waiting for digg to right itself and the community to realign maybe one day one day i wont care much and will give up and will fade away with the rest of them for now its a bad habit i cant seem to break yet

5164727 i felt when i grew older id outgrow certain bands when it came to music that id stop enjoying rock when i was older that didnt happen i still enjoy some of the things that i did 10 years ago is that bad

5164729 what nonsense i dont even know what a panic attack is does it mean i thought i had a heart attack no such thing happened to me

5164732 the whole idea of announcing the project long before things had even begun to fall in place was to cash in on kishoredas 79th birthday august 4 the fact is nothing is ready yet it would take at least a year if not more for this ambitious project to concretise
5164733 it is a daunting task to put together a biopic on a man as colourful versatile adventurous and unpredictable as kishore kumar
5164734 im currently in new york finalising locations for the film that im going to direct for karan johar so i really dont know whats going on back home
5164735 they mustve their reason for announcing the project when they did i havent started any work on it ive just heard that im doing it
5164736 the films director shoojit sircar and i have known each other for years when i was told he was helming the project i didnt hesitate
5164737 how do i telescope a life so flush with genius

5164740 from a neurolinguistic standpoint harts and shermans comments confirm what i have learned about mccain and obama from the many speeches interviews and debates i have analyzed
5164741 sony ericsson wanted to make sure our first hsdpa handset was the perfect combination of style and function as all know hsdpa is a big leap forward in the speed of mobile functionality but as always sony ericsson does not deliver technology for its own sake
5164742 we believe the z750 is such a compelling offer because not only will it be one of the best looking clamshells on the market but it also provides the tools or applications which really let you get the most from these broadband speeds
5164743 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move
5164744 we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence
5164745 now my first question was the cone of silence comfortable that you were in just now
5164746 the stones have been in my family for years i added only the flowers and had them set together
5164747 and knows you there are far larger stones in the vaults i know i remember one necklace in particular that the lady mother leanore was fond of a sapphire the size of a walnut but he knows youd never wear them no matter how badly he might like to give them to you
5164748 if you have no more need of me lady ill be dressing myself now
5164749 absolutely mara thank you and thank you for agreeing to attend this evening
5164750 they are even lovelier on than in the box but the wearer is more beautiful yet
5164751 so badly that he died the perth magistrates court has been told

5164753 ive seen people transfer what they are talking about in the kitchen to the marae tea the aim of this research is to help capture transmit and revitalise the genre and provide some examples for coming generations of what is tapu and what is noa and of where and how to use genre
5164754 are the governments going to provide leadership or are they going to provide management
5164755 they seem very much these days into managing or micro managing the polls
5164756 but i think the community is saying look you to provide the leadership here and they can only provide the leadership if theyve got good advice and thats what we want to give them
5164757 there are experts and there are experts certainly in government groups but what we need is an independent panel thats going to speak without fear or favour
5164758 to win here the feeling is a little bit more special
5164759 in tennis slams are more important but for the sportsman the olympic games are more important than anything
5164760 that if somebody were to take it away from me he would have to play an incredible tennis schedule win the biggest tournaments dominate the game basically i think rafa totally deserves it
5164761 you know my english is not perfect so it is difficult to express something like this if i can help with something to bangladesh the people just have to tell me and its going to be a pleasure for me always
5164762 we are talking about an island that is the same size as hong kong island where we want to add things such as an airport so ultimately we are certainly looking at several billions
5164763 the kings presence always stabilizes problematic national situations and citizens and political parties always respect and want the king to be here the kings presence is definitely important because he is a symbol of national peace and stability
5164764 you are a runner and i am my fathers son
5164765 the next ballet i want to do is on our great river ganges
5164766 i have already made the script i want to bring the ganges on to the stage
5164767 it is a beautiful concept you know it starts with the mythological beginning of the ganges but it goes into todays time and issues associated with the river an environmental message will be given
5164768 i have 12 actors playing the roles of the kauravas and pandavas i play the role of draupadi our great epic mahabharata is then told from draupadis point of view

5164785 i have practised a lot on my finishing this week when things are not going your way you end up working a lot harder in training ive been doing that this week and thank god it paid off yesterday with it being our first win of the season its important to get off to a decent start to be fair i should have given us that last week when i missed that chance at kilmarnock it was nice to get the goal to help us do it against falkirk thats one win now and we can look forward to winning again next week
5164786 waduh kalau saya ga ada keinginan karena saya merasa ga punya kemampuan kalo buat saya presiden itu butuh pengalaman yang banyak pendidikan juga perlu
5164787 banyak juga parpol yang nawarin tapi saya yang ga mau mending saya jadi presiden kaos karena sampai belel masih dipakai tahan lama selain itu persyaratan jadi presiden itu usia 35 45 sedangkan saya umurnya 47 jadi sudah tidak masuk kriteria sudah ketuaan kalo si dik doank masih 42 masuk tuh
5164788 the lord of the rings the return of the king
5164789 all of us in new york hollywood and across the country should be concerned about how this failure to reach an agreement is impacting our members
5164790 they have already suffered significantly as a result of the writers guild of america strike and now they are experiencing an additional loss of work made worse when they can find a job by having to work without a contract under old terms and conditions
5164791 there are some who feel we have all the time in the world to make this deal
5164792 this advisory motion is not in the best interests of new york division sag members or any sag members across the country
5164793 it could delay and prolong the negotiations by emboldening management with a false belief that sag actors are split on the issues
5164794 nothing is happening and we are no closer to a deal than we were six weeks ago
5164795 in failing to bargain realistically with the amptp and remove unattainable items from the table our negotiating team controlled by the current hollywood leadership has pursued an agenda that has more to do with politics than with securing a beneficial contract and has betrayed the trust of the membership
5164796 sag and amptp full committees which combined number over 100 people will meet face to face again when we have reached a deal and shake hands across the table we are all hopeful that will happen soon
5164797 claims by sags negotiators about informal talks are no more true today than they were when first made two weeks ago
5164798 negotiations concluded when the producers presented their final offer on june 30 and no meetings are scheduled
5164799 mediation is an option available any time the parties mutually agree to it
5164800 mediation does not guarantee that negotiations will accelerate to an agreement and often has slowed the process down as recently seen in the wga negotiations which included mediation
5164801 it has not up to this point been viewed as something the parties feel would facilitate an agreement
5164802 sag has made significant compromises to reach tentative agreement on the resolved issues
5164803 we also believe that what we are asking for to close the gap and make this deal is extremely reasonable and addresses the actual needs of actors and their families in these times of technological advances and economic challenges
5164804 all of the new media terms in the producers final offer including those related to original new media programs are subject to a sunset clause that protects both performers and producers by allowing the two sides to reevaluate all of the new media terms in three years and bargain from a point of greater knowledge about the markets development
5164805 the president will address the nation at 1 00pm 0700 gmt
5164806 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall
5164807 he has seen the sentiments of not just the elected representatives but various institutions who all asked him to move in a particular way and do not destabilise things here
5164808 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter
5164809 during expansion work in the 18th century the monastery wanted to compete with el escorial
5164810 in the end the only part of the project that remained was the library which was completed in 1776
5164811 in the spirit of the counter reformation monasteries had to have a ceremonial hall aimed to impress
5164812 admonts benedictine monks chose the library since the rule of saint benedict pray work and study places special emphasis on reading
5164813 the architect josef hueber wanted light to flood this place and the mind
5164814 the library has regained its original brilliance and were now hoping to welcome over 70 000 visitors per year even though were off the tourists path
5164815 the books which we got back after the war still bear the camps stamp
5164816 the victims were all poor laborers and civilians this was a barbaric act carried out by the enemies of afghanistan at a time of celebration of independence
5164817 from now on our girls will be freed after their initiation rites so they can go to school
5164818 it was a long process punctuated by prayers and sacrifices to the ancestors
5164819 rites reserved for girls will from now on take place during the holidays
5164820 we would like sea shepherd to strictly keep from undertaking physical activities regardless of what kind of thinking it has on whaling
5164821 i believe the international community holds the shared view that a situation where physical interference causes injuries or threatens lives of those involved should not be forgiven no matter what sort of arguments sea shepherd has
5164822 president musharraf is not going to saudi arabia or any other country and he will fight impeachment constitutionally
5164823 lius injury has been diagnosed as something wrong with his hamstring but not with the bone
5164824 it is an accumulated injury due to long training and it will affect him if he uses power
5164825 it wont cause problems for the heats but im worried about the semi finals and the final
5164826 the march of the volunteers chinas national anthem is ringing out in every stadium
5164827 chinese lag behind in track and field despite all the efforts we have made to improve it is still a long way to go before we catch up with the world level
5164828 with events like track and field chinas pace in winning gold medals will slow down
5164829 this result was driven by strong global demand and improved spreads particularly in export markets where higher global steel prices offset rising raw material costs
5164830 our asian businesses particularly thailand where economic conditions continue to improve are producing consistent results
5164831 in the next five years theres no reason why demand cant stay strong due to bric brazil russia india china economies
5164832 in china there may well be some slower growth but demand for steel continues to very strong and weve still got russia and india going flat out
5164833 we can see little flashpoints in gas prices or a spike in joblessness but getting the whole picture is extremely difficult in part because were depending on government collected data which could often be three months later
5164834 is it a housing story is it a gasoline prices story is it an inflation story
5164835 we need to create other listening posts than the treasury department and the bureau of labor statistics
5164836 overall this is a hard story for journalists to tell because it isnt an event it isnt a person
5164837 and yet where they can get a handle on it its a story that people are eager to hear
5164838 unless they bring some comprehensive changes in the security this deployment will not affect peoples confidence
5164839 people are afraid to leave their house after 7 p m
5164840 i am still a student but this was an order from the commander of the academy that we should come out and search the vehicles
5164841 we are broadly questioning these people about their links and their involvement direct or indirect in bomb blasts in jaipur and other places

5164843 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5164844 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5164845 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5164846 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5164847 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5164848 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5164849 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5164850 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5164851 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5164852 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5164853 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5164854 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5164855 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5164856 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5164857 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5164858 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5164859 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5164860 my hunch is that a lot of this is new voter registrations
5164861 the move to the democrats in rhode island seems consistent with what is happening nationally rhode island seems to be fitting a national pattern
5164862 common sense would say that the republicans will lose registrations to the democrats and in some jurisdictions independents
5164863 i think a lot of this has to do frankly with the obama candidacy and the excitement he has generated
5164864 i think this is an area where there is a good indication that a lot of young people are part of this trend
5164865 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5164866 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5164867 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5164868 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5164869 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5164870 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5164871 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5164872 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5164873 who are open to doing something on the production side
5164874 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5164875 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5164876 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5164877 se marcan unos objetivos muy ambiciosos para evitar la tentaci n de hacer peque os progresos
5164878 these workers are most anxious to stay here the employer knows it and the employer is in an incredibly powerful position in respect to these workers
5164879 a lot of employers say they are fantastic workers they work day and night and they dont object

5164883 volatility of world gold prices accompanied with high levels as well as the increase of inflation rates in the kingdom had the impact of decreasing demand in tonnage terms
5164884 but the region is not experiencing the same economic concerns as other parts of the world and this positive economic outlook should enable the recent resilience in gold demand relative to other parts of the world to continue nevertheless the level of demand will continue to depend on both the gold price and its volatility
5164885 what we want to do is gear this toward the moms
5164886 its the moms who really need information and calming down their lives are kind of turned upside down
5164887 its what our grandmothers did literally combing it out one at a time our market is people who dont want to be bothered with it or dont care how much it costs
5164888 right after school it was going around madisons circle of friends she had so many there was no way i was going to have the time to deal with it
5164889 were already seeing it start to ramp up from summer camps
5164890 and blockbuster movies where lice are transferred from theater seat backs this summer have been our friend
5164891 it caused more alarm and anxiousness as parents didnt know how to identify it
5164892 by inviting them in to educate them and to help do two lice checks a year it kind of turned the whole issue around we saw a substantial decrease in the number of students
5164893 the issue is that people dont want to use a lot of the traditional treatments that were pesticide based
5164894 once you use those the removal still takes a lot of time
5164895 this is something they can do at home all it takes is a fine toothed lice comb good light and patience

5164910 any investment strategy that allocates significant portions of the portfolio to volatile or illiquid assets
5164911 the whole point of the new policy is to make it far less likely that congress will have to engineer a bailout
5164912 we made a lot of risks in serving in the first set in the second set we changed tactics and the result was better we could have done better but we lost finally
5164913 but were satisfied with the result we played against the world champions and it was a very close match

5164923 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5164924 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5164925 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5164926 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5164927 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5164928 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5164929 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5164930 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5164931 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5164932 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5164933 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5164934 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5164935 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5164936 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5164937 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5164938 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5164939 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5164940 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5164941 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5164942 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5164943 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5164944 a t on une fois vu un coup d tat se produire en france en allemagne en italie en grande bretagne au japon ou aux tats unis dam rique
5164945 tas raison cest presque toujours dans les pays du sud
5164946 normal a recoupe ce que je dis les pays riches sont au nord
5164947 il faut plut t inverser les termes de ta question
5164948 tu dois te demander ce qua de particulier le sud que le nord na pas
5164949 euh je vois ce que tu veux dire tu veux parler des immenses richesses en mati res premi res dont le transfert est organis depuis la p riode coloniale jusqu nos jours du sud en direction du nord
5164950 bien s r que ce transfert sop re en m me temps que lappauvrissement de limmense majorit de la population du sud
5164951 que ce transfert sop re parall lement lenrichissement dun poign e de nantis locaux maintenus au pouvoir par la force au sud par le nord
5164952 que cette minorit de nantis est partag e en petits groupes dint r t repr sentant chacun un pays diff rent du nord
5164953 que r guli rement ces diff rents groupes des pays du sud se relaient au pouvoir par la force pour garantir les int r ts des pays du nord
5164954 il faut pr ciser que ces int r ts sont ceux des multinationales dont les si ges sont situ s au nord
5164955 bien s r a veut dire quau nord aussi il y a des pauvres
5164956 oui sauf que ces pauvres l nont pas besoin de faire des coups d tat puisquils votent r guli rement pour lire des dirigeants politiques au service des multinationales qui organisent le transfert des richesses du sud vers le nord
5164957 si je comprends bien tes en train de me dire que les pauvres du sud et du nord se trouvent en fait du m me bord
5164958 et que donc en r alit la division nord sud cest du bidon que la ligne de fracture est ailleurs
5164959 dis moi alors que transf rent ces multinationales dun pays comme la mauritanie
5164960 tu veux dire que la mauritanie ne peut pas faire partie de lupm
5164961 a reste quand m me une ancienne colonie fran aise
5164962 a veut dire que ces multinationales ont leurs si ges sociaux en france
5164963 a veut dire aussi que les fran ais pauvres et leurs coll gues mauritaniens ont des int r ts communs
5164964 tout fait et quils peuvent envisager de sorganiser pour les faire valoir ensemble
5164965 to my knowledge there was no diplomatic contact between the v i government and the peoples republic of china i spent my own money to bring local gifts for my hosts
5164966 but nothing can compare to the time i spent in changchun china 40 singular and surreal days there were 45 of us international sculptors from angola to swaziland to the faeroe islands samoa and the caribbean the bahamas grenada barbados and haiti
5164967 theyre still students the hook getting them here today is community service
5164968 as a little guy i used to make things out of mango seeds
5164969 whatever i could find i grew up in savan and i went to dober school until the 5th grade when we moved to new york
5164970 it was a terrible time strikes and a harsh winter what do you do when things are bad you come home
5164971 i have an 18 year old son regel just starting college in the states
5164972 malaysia libya brunei and i became close living together dining touring and dialoguing on different levels
5164973 for most of us it was the first time working on this scale executing a life sized or larger sculpture proved to be more of a physical than a technical challenge for some
5164974 for me it required climbing up and down a shaky scaffolding and moving a ton of clay transforming a 12 inch scale model into a three meter bronze piece requires understanding materials and engineering concepts especially structural and aesthetic balance
5164975 the centerpiece for the park is a 23 meter sculpture created by five of chinas most favored sculptors which consists of three girls and a dove of peace
5164976 it makes me feel really proud to know my sculpture will be there
5164977 ill be a little nervous or have some anxiety tomorrow
5164978 but i think if you dont have that there is something wrong with you
5164979 with the greens the way they are i figured i had to shoot 67 or better to have any chance of being near the leaders
5164980 to go through 72 holes without bogeying would have been pretty wishful thinking
5164981 thats while i am having all these surgeries this year
5164982 its nerve racking sending your first child to school youre dropping them into the hands of a stranger and youre just walking away
5164983 whether theyll have trouble or not is as much about temperament as anything
5164984 shes still under the impression that shell be in the same class as her brother
5164985 the most important thing for parents to keep in mind is their kids emotional states are going to be largely influenced by their parents emotional states
5164986 if the parent acts worried this conveys to the child i need to be fearful
5164987 like were a dashboard with these instruments kids can read
5164988 i love you and school is going to be so much fun
5164989 youre going to make new friends and soon youll be the best counter in this house
5164990 anything you can do to make this less strange and less unfamiliar and less scary would be a good thing
5164991 show them that you keep your promises that when mom says shell be back in hour shes back in an hour
5164992 id say im sorry but youve got to go to school
5164993 i did feel sorry for him but i couldnt let him know that
5164994 youre always walking a fine line between taking charge and being a good listener as a parent but at the moment of the drop off that is not the time to be a good listener this is time for the teacher to take over
5164995 i worried about whether he would be able to do it on his own would he know how to unpack his lunch box would he make it back inside off the playground
5164996 but lo and behold i had prepared him and he was fine
5164997 our oldest daughter she loved school the only time she cried was at the end of the day because it was time to go home and she wanted to stay
5164998 and he got aggravated at school because he was learning he wouldnt get his way
5164999 it all depends on how you the parent present school to them
5165000 to offer consumers more choice and flexibility in how they purchase channels
5165001 the inescapable logic is that by 2011 satellite radio subscribers will face monopoly price hikes by a company with the incentive and ability to impose them
5165002 i dont think there will be any downside for consumers
5165003 consumers who may have been interested in the prospect of satellite radio but were put off with the lack of alternative pricing plans
5165004 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
5165005 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
5165006 as soon as the storm passes through people are going to want to rent mopeds
5165007 and i dont think anyone would have beaten him with a run like that today
5165008 i told you all i was going to be no 1
5165009 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
5165010 anything is possible the human body is changing so you never know
5165011 i aim just to win but when i saw the replay i was amazed
5165012 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
5165013 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
5165014 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
5165015 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
5165016 it is the boards responsibility placed on it by the government to provide information for people mainly parents with young children
5165017 i think part of the problem is that the bbfc is an industry body rather than a public body
5165018 often one of the reasons why the certificate doesnt appear is that the art departments working on the publicity havent featured it into their designs
5165019 although the studios are not legally obliged to abide by the guidelines the board expects them to do so
5165020 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
5165021 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
5165022 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
5165023 im going there pittsburgh in the beginning of september and with an approach that im going to make the team
5165024 its kind of a back port if things go bad there
5165025 ive been following pittsburghs lineup tough great bunch of older and younger players
5165026 een donkere huid beschermt tegen ultraviolette straling en laat in een tropisch klimaat met veel intensieve zonuren voldoende zonlicht door om vitamine d aan te maken in een europees klimaat is dat niet het geval je kunt dus zeggen dat de plek waar je woont je huidskleur be nvloedt
5165027 it would be hard for abc not to make a play for leno
5165028 he is still at the top of his game and the thinking is that a lot of ad dollars would follow him to another network
5165029 which of the existing supreme court justices would you not have appointed
5165030 califone have always been stupidly underappreciated and the further we stumble into the 21st century the more this music starts to feel both familiar and necessary
5165031 it may be the most sophisticated political satire ever made in hollywood
5165032 califone have always been stupidly underappreciated and the further we stumble into the 21st century the more this music starts to feel both familiar and necessary
5165033 it may be the most sophisticated political satire ever made in hollywood
5165034 die spd braucht endlich mehr disziplin und zwar thematisch und personell
5165035 wir d rfen nicht den eindruck erwecken wir seien ein wilder h hnerhaufen
5165036 wir m ssen uns jetzt damit besch ftigen wie das jahr 2020 aussieht
5165037 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5165038 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5165039 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5165040 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5165041 i hate my hands i hate you i hate the piano
5165042 he sat in the corner very quietly and at no point interfered there were a few nice occasions when id make suggestions and you could see the father smiling
5165043 the problem wasnt his attitude but the tone he set for other parents it became more competitive
5165044 weve made it clear weve posted signs that parents are welcome in our building but not upstairs in the studios or in rehearsals unless specifically invited by a faculty member they want to protect their own children but they also spy on others to compare talents
5165045 its something we have to deal with and hope that students understand that its very difficult to change the parents
5165046 we can only intervene when there is some action taken within the building
5165047 my body has been making people laugh since i was a teenager
5165048 i hated the music but looking back on it rock and roll was fun back then
5165049 yeah i gained even less respect for them than i had previously
5165050 the musicians are in the front making music the drummer sits behind them and bangs on things like a baboon
5165051 when youve been drumming all night long and its 8 30 in the morning and youve been shooting since 4 30 p m the day before
5165052 its very sticky on the throne as they call it
5165053 they call it a modesty pouch it has a little drawstring its remarkably similar to the pouch i used to carry my multisided dungeons and dragons dice
5165054 and one geek that i think gets short shrift is the comedy geek i was the kind of kid who would sit with a tape recorder in front of the tv for the monty pythons that would play at midnight on sundays on pbs recording on a cassette id listen to it over and over again memorizing all the songs and sketches
5165055 my parents were bohemian hippie types who lived on a houseboat in seattle in the 60s
5165056 my mom wanted to name me thucydides after the greek historian my dad wanted to name me rainer after the poet rainer maria rilke my middle name is dietrich after dietrich fischer dieskau the opera singer somehow or other it ended up being rainn with two ns go figure
5165057 it sucked when i was in junior high school and getting made fun of and slapped around a little bit
5165058 but its worked out pretty well in my professional life its a name people remember
5165059 basically what happens with every comedy script in hollywood is its shipped off to will ferrell and jack black and ben stiller
5165060 if they all pass the studio goes ok now what the expletive do we do with this
5165061 my name was on a list of five people the studio would consider to do the movie with
5165062 i met with the producers and really responded to it i love the physical comedy and the silliness of it and the rock and roll
5165063 but i also love the fact that in this time of very dark r rated comedies its a sweet movie with an almost john hughes feel a curiously old fashioned feel good comedy
5165064 rainn brings an intensity to whatever he does that makes dwight ring like a smartly tapped bell
5165065 and for dwight he combines a number of traits from classic nerds to rural types into something that is pretty unique
5165066 you wouldnt believe the number of times i get the phrase you dont understand
5165067 people in hollywood always talk about likability i kind of feel thats bull
5165068 i think if you make a character specific really make him live and breathe people will get on board likability or not
5165069 if you can see the characters heart in some way even as warped as dwight schrutes is they will get on the train and millions have gotten on the dwight train
5165070 several key problems that lie beneath the emirates glittering facade
5165071 dubai is still an autocracy where real evidence of an opening for true democracy proves hard to find and where far less political reform has occurred than in neighboring gulf states including even saudi arabia
5165072 an extreme nanny state in which every aspect of their financial lives has been taken care of
5165073 a weekday visit to any of dubais major shopping malls reveals legions of able bodied young men drinking coffee and playing video games
5165074 theres no technological reason why you cant play cross platform but theres a philosophical reason why design doesnt want to do it if we have to compromise one platform to support both then we wont
5165075 a couple of members of our team gained a lot of experience working on shadowrun and no matter how well you fine tune it you end up with a player base thats polarised
5165076 pc guys say ps3 guys have aim assist and the controls nerfed for them
5165077 theres no technological reason why you cant play cross platform but theres a philosophical reason why design doesnt want to do it if we have to compromise one platform to support both then we wont
5165078 a couple of members of our team gained a lot of experience working on shadowrun and no matter how well you fine tune it you end up with a player base thats polarised
5165079 pc guys say ps3 guys have aim assist and the controls nerfed for them
5165080 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
5165081 it moves what the rules were from 1993 to the new world we live in but it maintains civil liberties
5165082 provide specialized equipment technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel
5165083 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
5165084 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise
5165085 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
5165086 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
5165087 in the right direction however the vagueness of the provisions giving broad access to criminal intelligence to undefined agencies is very troubling
5165088 sister a real terrible thing has happened to our town
5165089 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street
5165090 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
5165091 this town has constantly been changing it had opened its heart to change but now i sense anguish within people
5165092 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
5165093 a lot of good workers were taken away a lot of good families are gone
5165094 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive
5165095 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
5165096 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
5165097 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
5165098 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
5165099 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
5165100 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
5165101 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
5165102 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
5165103 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
5165104 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
5165105 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
5165106 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
5165107 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa
5165108 i heard there was work here so i came first to get settled if it works out then i will bring them
5165109 before we tolerated everything they did to us at the plant we worked very hard but we lived free
5165110 now we have no work we are not free and we have no idea what will happen to us
5165111 in view of americas determination to set up a missile defence shield in europe the military is reviewing all its plans to give washington an adequate response
5165112 it is really unfortunate that russia chooses to react by putting nuclear warheads in different places if indeed it does that when the rest of the world is not looking at some kind of old fashioned superpower conflict
5165113 at a beach in france while the russians took berlin
5165114 all the russians have to do is turn off the oil and gas spigot
5165115 the deal gave the russians the right to continue patrolling
5165116 georgian army killed about 2000 citizens of russia russia protected its citizens
5165117 missile shield potential first strike target for power it is intended to deter

5165122 ive got boatloads of cash stashed away in different bank accounts i dont really need to work for a livin i was just doing a favor to president george bush senior who kinda wanted me to follow in his footsteps i really wasnt hoping for no reelection
5165123 i dont really care what happens now it can be anyone as long as it aint no woman or queer
5165124 this is a horrible blow to the country and its people the watergate scandal and nixons subsequent impeachment were minor compared to this embarrassing disaster
5165125 its about time hes done enough damage to americas economy its time we repaired severed international alliances and worked on rebuilding and stabilizing our economy
5165126 and that was with my fist this is really a non story
5165127 i hate those dykes this is off the record right
5165128 the strap on ellen takes puts my meat to shame
5165129 so far weve only sold one and that was to the department of agriculture for research but we think its a hot item just look at what it did for that hilton slut
5165130 id shoot anyone in the face who asked me if i carry that video thats disgusting
5165131 como o mundo muito grande ser dif cil o seu cumprimento
5165132 ah a frescura na face de n o cumprir um dever faltar positivamente estar no campo que ref gio o n o se poder ter confian a em n s respiro melhor agora que passaram as horas dos encontros faltei a todos com uma delibera o do desleixo fiquei esperando a vontade de ir para l que eu saberia que n o vinha sou livre contra a sociedade organizada e vestida estou nu e mergulho na gua da minha imagina o tarde para eu estar em qualquer dos dois pontos onde estaria mesma hora deliberadamente mesma hora est bem ficarei aqui sonhando versos e sorrindo em it lico t o engra ada esta parte assistente da vida at n o consigo acender o cigarro seguinte se um gesto fique com os outros que me esperam no desencontro que a vida
5165133 estamos convencidos de que as reformas contidas no tratado de lisboa s o necess rias para tornar a europa mais democr tica e mais eficaz e que lhe permitir o responder aos desafios com que os nossos cidad os est o confrontados

5165135 de todos os europeus que queriam votar neste tratado e foram impedidos pelos seus governos
5165136 summer heat continues in short supply continuing a trend that has dominated much of the 21st centurys opening decade
5165137 there have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at midway airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 thats by far the fewest 90 degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930
5165138 the suns surface has been fairly blank for the last couple of years and that has some worried that it may be entering another maunder minimum the suns 50 year abstinence from sunspots which some scientists have linked to the little ice age of the 17th century
5165139 cycle 23 which hasnt finished yet looks like it will be long at least 12 to 13 years and cycle 24 which has still to start looks like it will be exceptionally weak
5165140 based on the past armagh measurements this suggests that over the next two decades
5165141 temperatures have already fallen by about 0 5 degrees c over the past 12 months and if this is only the start of it it would be a serious concern
5165142 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5165143 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5165144 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5165145 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5165146 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5165147 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5165148 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5165149 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5165150 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5165151 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5165152 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5165153 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5165154 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5165155 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5165156 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5165157 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5165158 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5165159 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5165160 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5165161 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5165162 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5165163 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5165164 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5165165 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5165166 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5165167 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5165168 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5165169 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5165170 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5165171 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5165172 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5165173 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5165174 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5165175 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5165176 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5165177 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5165178 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5165179 i truly believe that the florida division of elections every decision that came from their office favored bush
5165180 hannah montana and miley cyrus best of both worlds concert
5165181 a lottery and you know that with lotteries you lose most of the time
5165182 theres nothing like taking a nice quiet bomb apart to steady the nerves
5165183 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5165184 its the first thing that everyone mentions the thing that everyone wants to know about him isnt that peculiar they say but i dont know that it is that peculiar
5165185 a lot of it makes an awful lot of sense and a lot of movie directors that ive worked with work in a similar way
5165186 for instance i never sat down and had a big conversation about my character with christopher nolan
5165187 im not trivializing it woody is certainly an eccentric individual but i think theres an awful lot of nonsense thats cooked up around the cult of woody allen
5165188 we got there and we didnt really know what we were going to do with it
5165189 the good thing is that woody shoots all of the exploratory stuff
5165190 because theres nothing worse than doing that thing where you rehearse something and something good happens and then you all sit around and go and that was great wasnt it that thing that happened
5165191 it never works so i appreciate the fact that he shoots all that working out stuff
5165192 and we did it for a long time that scene and we worked it in lots of different ways and we shot it in lots of different ways and i think whats finally there is a mishmash of things that we tried out but it was written so brilliantly that scene that it would have worked anyway
5165193 ive lived in england my whole life but my mothers from detroit
5165194 i essentially can be american as much as i can be english
5165195 its not a light decision at all to go into something that all of your family does for obvious reasons
5165196 and there was definitely a stage where i didnt tell anyone that i wanted to act even though i might have wanted to somewhere deep down my rebellion didnt really amount to much apart from wandering around at family parties and telling everyone i was going to be a painter
5165197 thats the thing if i was going to rebel properly i would have had to have been a banker or a rocket scientist but that side of my brain was not functioning at all
5165198 without wanting to come over all sort of feminist about it its just brilliant to watch a female director because there arent many of them around unfortunately she has a knack of just commanding everyones respect whilst being very witty and brilliant
5165199 its about two neighboring apartments in a building in downtown new york
5165200 catherine keener and her husband oliver platt and their 15 year old daughter live in one and the other one is home to a woman in her 90s who has two grandchildren who are me and amanda peet were sort of caring for her
5165201 when youre a 14 year old and youre fantasizing about where your lifes going to go i sat around fantasizing about playing a particular type of woody allen american heroine in a particular type of romantic bittersweet funny woody allen film
5165202 and suddenly i was sitting there with it in my lap is this really happening its very peculiar
5165203 but then youre set with a whole other set of problems
5165204 you know be careful what you wish for youve got to live up to your own expectations of yourself which is always a nightmare
5165205 allow the president to invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion and you allow him to do so whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose and you allow him to make war at pleasure
5165206 no more men would be called out and no more money expended than would be absolutely necessary to bring the present state of hostilities to an end
5165207 those three standards accomplishing ones stated programs exercising assertive executive leadership and assuming accountability for the actions of the executive branch are good benchmarks against which to judge any president
5165208 a kind of memoir centered on the act of running
5165209 i knew that if i did things half heartedly and they didnt work out id have regrets
5165210 whats crucial is whether your writing attains the standards you set for yourself in this sense writing novels and running full marathons are very much alike basically a writer has a quiet inner motivation and doesnt seek validation in the outwardly visible
5165211 running is both exercise and a metaphor running day after day piling up the races bit by bit i raise the bar and by clearing each level i elevate myself in long distance running the only opponent you have to beat is yourself the way you used to be
5165212 being eighteen till you die means you die when youre eighteen
5165213 the kind of wonderful day when you expect to see mel torme appear out of nowhere leaning against a grand piano as he croons out a verse from autumn in new york
5165214 it was a helen keller hand under the water moment lordy i can finally see cold fusion right there in the bathroom stall it was the greatest feeling ever my endorphins leaped at this new opportunity hugging it and feeling all its splendid corners my thats better
5165215 although i failed to get the hang of some of the fundamental tenets of recovery i believed i was an asset to every treatment center i wheeled through
5165216 reporting can be obnoxious no matter who is asking the questions about what but all this was the more so because the reporter wanted to ask deep probing questions about himself even for me it was a new level of solipsism
5165217 so other than being addled from an unspeakable habit a little smelly and a touch on the amazingly obese side i was good to go ready to star in one of those car commercials where the kids crack wise in the backseat while dad says something sage and knowing into the rearview except i didnt have a car and the kids did not belong to me i had never married their mother or established my paternity i had no insurance and i had not paid taxes in several years
5165218 i know some of you will thumb through the book and go directly to the end to find out what happens
5165219 well dont waste your time because that is not the way i write
5165220 r amp b music had always consisted of love songs now songwriters started exploring the color barrier with their songs papa was a rolling stone and love child come to mind as examples of this shift
5165221 i told the guys that rich and i would go out and warm up the crowd with some comedy
5165222 and then we would play or attempt to play the tunes we rehearsed one bit melted into the next until we ended the show and had both forgotten entirely about the band sitting behind their instruments waiting to play
5165223 if i think we could make the movies like up in smoke today and i tell them no i was incarcerated for nine months simply because i made those movies back in the 70s and 80s it is in the court records i was incarcerated for nine months for taking responsibility for a box of glass water pipes that was shipped across state lines
5165224 cheech and i met with the heads of columbia pictures to pitch our next two films when we met outside the columbia offices cheech asked me what stories we were going to tell them i told cheech that i had a few plot lines i was working on wed have to just improvise
5165225 cheech was wearing the suit he wore in nash bridges
5165226 and was very straight and dry in answering the questions

5165228 this is about generating new revenue streams for musicians the record companies take a piece of the tour and the merchandise but they cant take a piece of this
5165229 i cant believe im entrusted with the legacy of the most famous words in the world
5165230 i realized i could help musicians generate new revenue without feeling like theyre selling out
5165231 its almost like shes giving a scholarship to these people who are being creative
5165232 it by itself is not going to save the music industry but its certainly a nice plus

5165236 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
5165237 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
5165238 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
5165239 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
5165240 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
5165241 russia should welcome having democracies on its border not threaten them

5165247 i just wanted to say that i had a great experience with your service on 3 28 08 i was the last job scheduled for the day and we started at 6pm i asked your crew to unload my antiques at 3 different locations in the city they had a great attitude the entire time even though it was late and they must have been exhausted i will definitly recommend your company to people in the future

5165262 we expect a strong first first half 2008 09 having already had a good start to 2009 mainly driven by continued strong global steel demand and prices he said
5165263 realised prices in the first quarter will be slightly higher than last quarter
5165264 the pricing environment in the global steel market is offsetting those cost increases mr omalley said
5165265 as we move from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 our raw material costs specifically coal and iron ore will go by about up 1 2 billion
5165266 our total raw materials cost taking scrap and alloys into account will increase by about 1 6 billion
5165267 cost escalations are a challenge not just in australia but globally
5165268 well continue to work on cost reductions but productivity improvements are an important part of our business as well
5165269 in the next five years theres no reason why demand cant stay strong due to bric brazil russia india china economies he said
5165270 in china there may well be some slower growth but demand for steel continues to very strong
5165271 and weve still got russia and india going flat out
5165272 we see the supply and demand dynamic remaining quite tight

5165283 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5165284 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5165285 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5165286 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5165287 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america

5165291 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5165292 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
5165293 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
5165294 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
5165295 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better

5165318 we have worked very hard to develop a comprehensive selection of custom badges and acces sories for distribu tors to provide to their custom ers the release of our catalog coupled with the launch of our fully interactive web site www signa turebadges com is the culmination of our arrival as a traditional yet in novative product and service pro vider
5165319 our timing as to the completion of this catalog was dependent upon our attainment of the correct mix of styles and products suf cient to justify this signi cant investment
5165320 we realize that the ability to signi cantly expand our business was dependent upon the completion of our catalog and web site
5165321 we are aware that imple menting the neces sary infrastructure to support our expected business growth is critical we have been diligently putting in place the appropri ate production and customer service re sources to successfully support our sales and marketing efforts
5165322 we have been under the gun for several months to expand our production capabilities and i am confident this relocation will allow signature to be more responsive and competitive
5165323 we have always emphasized the importance of planning for growth so that we do not fall short of our ability to fulfill customers expectations this relocation fits right in with our long term plan for expansion
5165324 albatross and its follow up man of the world were untypical of fleetwood macs stage material
5165325 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5165326 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5165327 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5165328 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5165329 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5165330 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5165331 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5165332 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5165333 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5165334 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5165335 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5165336 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5165337 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5165338 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5165339 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5165340 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5165341 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5165342 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5165343 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5165344 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5165345 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5165346 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5165347 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

5165350 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5165351 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5165352 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

5165360 people are now coming out of the closet on the word empire
5165361 the fact is no country has been as dominant culturally economically technologically and militarily in the history of the world since the roman empire
5165362 ive argued that not since the roman empire has anyone had such extraordinary power as the united states after the cold war

5165428 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
5165429 in the summer of 2007 as arctic sea ice reached a record low the northwest passage opened between baffin bay and mcclure strait also known as mclure strait passing through parry channel this opening would be the route through the arctic most conducive to large scale shipping as of early august 2008 arctic sea ice was not expected to set a new melt record although its extent was well below the long term average whether the northwest passage would open as far north as it did the previous year remained in question but the sea ice in a more southerly route one taken by norwegian explorer roald amundsen in the early twentieth century had begun to melt

5165433 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5165434 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5165435 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5165436 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5165437 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5165438 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5165439 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5165440 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al

5165448 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5165449 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5165450 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5165451 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5165452 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5165453 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5165454 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5165455 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5165456 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

5165460 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5165461 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5165462 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5165463 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5165464 wir sitzen oft im sessel und gucken vor uns hin was ist dann wohl in unserem kopf ich wei es nicht aber wir brauchen das beide
5165465 ich bem he mich t glich nur eine sache zu machen die besonders anstrengend ist

5165471 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out

5165473 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5165474 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines

5165513 i am delighted that the trust is not a factor in building an internet marketing opportunity if so it might be a good deal harder to succeed
5165514 in a position to pay the cost of 2 recruitment advertising on your page and help the team in any way i can
5165515 i have now been given the opportunity to advertise to hire i hope that all ads are free and workplace otherwise might be incurring additional costs in the construction of the matrix

5165517 well i guess that settles it no need to worry is refreshing to deal with someone who knows everything after all not every joe walking down the street who could create this system
5165518 opfm hyper matrix is a matrix that is completely legal inspected by a us attorney usa compliance with the regulation sic
5165519 apparently the 7 monthly contributions to pay for their costs of tuition at the university opfm makes it legal so much for the q amp a
5165520 the opfm hyper matrix was designed to pay commissions mass early
5165521 2x if the matrix is 15 levels deep then it must have 32758 members of the available space and 5 of the 32758 members would be 1638 therefore this is the answer how to accumulate figure payment of 1638 members in 12 days and then check the commission will be 11 000 per month
5165522 i do not want this because it is in my opinion the most common error in using the english language today but that does not make it more acceptable
5165523 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis

5165526 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5165527 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all

5165529 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5165530 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5165531 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5165532 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5165533 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5165534 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5165535 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5165536 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5165537 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5165538 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5165539 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5165540 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5165541 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5165542 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5165543 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both

5165549 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5165550 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5165551 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5165552 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5165553 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5165554 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5165555 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5165556 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5165557 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5165558 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5165559 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5165560 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5165561 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5165562 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5165563 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5165564 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5165565 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5165566 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5165567 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5165568 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5165569 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5165570 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5165571 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5165572 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5165573 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5165574 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5165575 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5165576 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5165577 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5165578 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5165579 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5165580 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5165581 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5165582 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
5165583 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5165584 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5165585 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5165586 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5165587 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5165588 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5165589 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5165590 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5165591 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5165592 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5165593 just so you all know we did set a record
5165594 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5165595 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5165596 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5165597 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5165598 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5165599 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5165600 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5165601 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5165602 i cant be one of those mothers who are addicted to pills
5165603 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5165604 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5165605 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5165606 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5165607 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5165608 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5165609 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5165610 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5165611 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5165612 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5165613 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5165614 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5165615 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5165616 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5165617 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5165618 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5165619 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5165620 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5165621 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5165622 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5165623 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5165624 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5165625 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5165626 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5165627 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5165628 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5165629 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5165630 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5165631 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5165632 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5165633 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5165634 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5165635 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5165636 if you want to find someone dont be a douch bag

5165643 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5165644 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5165645 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5165646 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5165647 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5165648 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5165649 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5165650 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5165651 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5165652 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5165653 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5165654 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5165655 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5165656 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5165657 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5165658 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5165659 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5165660 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5165661 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5165662 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5165663 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5165664 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5165665 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5165666 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
5165667 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
5165668 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
5165669 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
5165670 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
5165671 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
5165672 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
5165673 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
5165674 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5165675 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5165676 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
5165677 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
5165678 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
5165679 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
5165680 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5165681 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source

5165683 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
5165684 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5165685 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are unhappy with their lot some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
5165686 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women
5165687 im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5165688 its not councils view and its not mine its hard when youve got to defend something someone else has said were definitely appalled
5165689 its a public attack on women and a form of verbal and emotional abuse
5165690 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting if he wants to come and visit our service im more than happy to have a yarn to him about what hes saying
5165691 theyre very archaic comments i dont think he realises the repercussions of labelling women based solely on their looks
5165692 the article didnt paint a very good picture of the men here either but ive never been treated with anything but the utmost respect ive never walked into a club and been preyed upon theyve been lovely
5165693 on u street a total of eight youths have been picking up the paintbrushes and gently applying blue brown and green acrylic colors to the side wall
5165694 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5165695 if youre not familiar with the term i just used heres how to learn about it

5165700 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5165701 i cannot image america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
5165702 since ive become speaker my flagship issue has been energy security and addressing the global climate crisis
5165703 energy independence is a national security economic environmental health and moral issue
5165704 the notion that oil companies are just sitting on oil leases is a myth
5165705 any measure that reduces oil firms margins in america is likely to have the effect of diverting at least some investment to other countries and so exacerbate the shortage of fuel produced at home
5165706 america has only 1 6 percent of the worlds oil supply but we use 24 percent so drilling isnt much of a solution at all
5165707 equivalent of 30 years of current imports from saudi arabia
5165708 the planet is gods creation and we have a moral responsibility to preserve it
5165709 natural seepage from the sea floor is a much larger source of oil in american waters than is offshore drilling
5165710 america can achieve true greatness when we work together to make certain that every voice in america is a voice that will be heard
5165711 who do you want to win china or the united states

5165724 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
5165725 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
5165726 i dunno we had just moved here and he was cheep
5165727 president musharraf is not going to saudi arabia or any other country and he will fight impeachment constitutionally
5165728 kill the wander from the straitened rivalry relentlessness take the canon present day my pair of glasses whereon the imposture reverso apropos of every television
5165729 we lost our moral high ground and set a precedent that invites any country on earth to do exactly the same thing
5165730 ill call the deputy mayor for public health next summer ill put you right in the morgue
5165731 that would pay for your housing and meals and you wouldnt have so much debt

5165735 is ok with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press
5165736 research shows that the abortion decisions of many women are influenced primarily by their desire to be good parents
5165737 each candidate is carefully pandering to a smorgasbord of special interest groups ranging from gay lesbian and transgender people to children of illegal immigrants to working mothers to evangelical christians
5165738 there is one group no one has recognized and it is the group that will decide the election the angry white man the angry white man comes from all economic backgrounds from dirt poor to filthy rich he represents all geographic areas in america from urban sophisticate to rural redneck deep south to mountain west left coast to eastern seaboard
5165739 weve had comments from angry brown men a filipino american chippewa indians black men and lots of angry white women
5165740 so i really did strike a chord and i guess it is that people feel like theyre not being listened to by our government people want some fiscal sanity they dont want people to just stand there with their hands out and be given something for doing nothing there are a lot of people who feel like theyre pulling the freight for the rest of the country and theyre sick of it
5165741 i suppose so tepidly he was all wrong on immigration but hes right on national defense environmentally hes got to be more proactive than bush was no one could be worse than bush
5165742 i think people are supporting him out of emotion rather than a rational analysis of his policies
5165743 if you want more taxes on people who really make this country run working americans to support yet another generation of sit on your butt and collect a check slackers then obamas your man
5165744 you better have my money next time i see you bitch ass nigga or im gonna make sure something much worse happens to your ass
5165745 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5165746 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5165747 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5165748 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5165749 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5165750 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5165751 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5165752 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5165753 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5165754 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5165755 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5165756 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5165757 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5165758 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5165759 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5165760 the package was installed successfully you should now be able to use whatever functionality it adds or changes or not be able to use functionality it removes

5165776 sidang 29 november 1970 amanat dan keputusan keputusan no 5
5165777 it definitely means a lot just getting a win but it also means a lot just being able to finally get one in san diego
5165778 any time you come home you want to do the best you possibly can
5165779 we werent able to really go out there and succeed
5165780 i think thats more the focus its all about the team when you start focusing on your own goals youre going to get yourself in trouble the ultimate goal is to get to the playoffs and get to the world series one win doesnt really mean anything a 5 2 record would have been a lot better
5165781 every one of us on the starting staff tries to put up good innings and quality starts and hope for the best
5165782 we have been able to do that but unfortunately it hasnt gone my way thats baseball
5165783 i think when you really try to be extra fine you get yourself in trouble
5165784 thats when you put too much pressure on yourself thats something that i learned over the past month
5165785 this team will hit because weve all done it before
5165786 but until we pick it up well have to make sure we are at least getting the clutch hits
5165787 its nice to win two of three especially when you score six runs
5165788 he was due to win one because hes pitched some real good ballgames
5165789 this guy has had some tough luck in getting some decisions getting some wins hes pitched much better than his record
5165790 it was supposed to be a slider away but it was up
5165791 i looked up one time and he was throwing three strikes for every one ball
5165792 long has our nation the united states of america kept the forces of chaos at bay
5165793 by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe

5165797 i went through my first earthquake in june i was in athens greece on tour with the greenwich academy madrigal singers i was on the balcony when i realized i was shaking i didnt realize that the whole building was shaking i thought that i was about to faint i shouted to my roommate rebekah and she said that she felt it too my parents used to live in san francisco and she told me about the earthquake drills they used to have at the bank where she worked they tell you to go underneath a doorway because it is structurally where the building is the strongest the earthquake only lasted a couple of seconds but like you we were both somewhat scared but we were all ok and it turned out to be a great story to tell everyone about tour there is no reason to live in fear learn the facts about how to stay safe during an earthquake so you wont be as scared next time
5165798 you really should brush your teeth as a part of everyday personal hygiene if youre having trouble getting into the habit of brushing there are these really cool tooth brushes called tooth tunes they play part of your favorite song while you brush through your teeth the toothbrushes come in all different types of pop songs and are really fun to use
5165799 shes my only child so its a big change for the both of us im thinking a year or two from now ill have cooties and then its off to college its the beginning of her really growing up
5165800 the parents come in the first day and their eyes are as wide as the kids you can recognize the new parents right away they walk slower and seem more reticent than anyone else
5165801 most of them walk right in ready to begin there are few who have a hard time but not many
5165802 because of everything they have to accomplish in the day kindergarten usually doesnt have the same open door policy as preschool where parents usually come and go
5165803 mysterious is scary and maybe your child is taking the bus going into an environment with a lot of new kids its logical to be little nervous if you are apprehensive about what their day is going to be like
5165804 i think because hes my youngest and hes a busy little boy im going to miss him
5165805 actually makes me more nervous because now i understand just how demanding kindergarten is today
5165806 all the sitting thats required kindergarten is a lot more structured then when we were kids hes ready to do all the things school required he can even read but hes also very typical of a boy his age he doesnt love to sit still
5165807 im big on using the word fun to talk about school
5165808 kindergarten is fun and i would be talking about how much fun it is going to be what they are going to learn the friends they are going to make
5165809 dont just leave the child and run out the door
5165810 if you really anticipate this being a problem tell the school ahead of time maybe the school social worker can be in your childs classroom to lend a hand maybe the teacher can make a special effort to meet your child beforehand
5165811 the good teacher is experienced with this and wants to be there for you

5165850 when i was very young my half sister jenny died tragically she was a teenager and it was the 80s she left behind a wardrobe of brightly colored clothes rainbow stickers life size paintings doodles on lined paper and hundreds of tapes these constitute most of my memories of her its sad for me to look at these things and usually i dont but a couple of summers ago i found a tape of hers with a startling cover photograph this was footloose i couldnt stop listening it was a portrait of 80s love desire pain freedom and frenzy of being a teenager in a time of change by listening i could step into jennys shoes see things from her vantage point i could be emancipated by rock and roll and walkmen just as she had been we could listen together i asked my friend thomas to cover the album which sheltered as he is he had never heard before i was clear that i wanted to him to cover the whole album the point wasnt to rework any one song but to re imagine the picture they made together with a new footloose we could reply to the past tell our own story about being young this is what he made

5165861 legal context as the credit crisis wanes and corporate liquidity becomes more available deal making is sure to return to past levels of activity ask any of these dealmakers why they made their acquisitions and inevitably they will return to the brands equity trade mark assets however are very unusual types of property which require finely tuned warranties in merger and acquisition m amp a transactions in order to prevent costly set backs and even litigation key points both buyers and sellers in an m amp a transaction have a mutual interest in accurately defining the trade mark assets included in a deal but their interests may diverge when it comes to negotiating certain warranties buyers should seek wide ranging assurances of trade marks validity while sellers should try to resist giving general warranties beyond their knowledge prudent negotiators should also consider the duration of warranties and negotiate limitations on breach of warranty claim amounts practical significance many corporate deals are agreed upon in haste and neglect key trade mark issues that can cause serious problems and costly surprises years after a deal has closed through proper due diligence and clearly worded warranties this risk can be reduced

5165889 hari itu ialah persiapan paskah kira kira jam 12 yoh 19 14
5165890 datanglah orang orang yahudi kepada pilatus dan meminta kepadanya supaya kaki orang orang yang disalib tersebut dipatahkan dan mayat mayatnya diturunkan
5165891 tetapi ketika mereka sampai kepada yesus dan melihat bahwa ia telah mati mereka tidak mematahkan kakinya
5165892 filatus heran saat mendengar bahwa yesus sudah mati maka ia memanggil kepala serdadu dan menanyakan kepadanya benarkah yesus sudah mati
5165893 dan lantaran perkataan mereka yang mengatakan sesungguhnya kami telah membunuh isa al masih anak maryam rasul allah itu
5165894 mereka menerima riwayat dari orang orang yahudi dan nasrani yang masuk islam satu riwayat yang dinukilkan ibnu jarir menyatakan bahwa rupa isa disamakan kepada yahuda yudas itu sendiri sehingga dialah yang ditangkap dan dialah yang disalib
5165895 sesudah itu yusuf dari arimatea ia murid yesus tetapi sembunyi sembunyi karena takut kepada orang orang yahudi meminta kepada pilatus supaya ia diperholehkan menurunkan mayat yesus dan pilatus meluluskan permintaannya itu lalu datanglah ia dan menurunkan mayat itu yoh 19 38

5165898 dan kami telah jadikan isa putra maryam beserta ibunya suatu bukti yang nyata hagi kekuasaan kami dan kami melindungi mereka di suatu tanah tinggi yang datar yang banyak terdapat padang padang rumput dan sumber sumber air bersih yang mengalir
5165899 suatu tanah tinggi yang datar yang banyak terdapat padang padang rumput dan sumber sumber air bersih yang mengalir

5165904 menyamhut yesus di tahun 2000 yang diselenggarakan oleh oregon state university as februari 1996 silam seperti dilaporkan mingguan news week edisi 8 april 1996 ummat no 22 thn i 29 april 1996 11 zulhijjah 1416 h doktrin kebangkitan itu mendapat gugatan gugatan kritis
5165905 pernyataan di dalam injil kanonik dan apokripa tidak menampakkan keasliannya tetapi dengan cara mana kepercayaan kebangkitan kristus disadari mengambil bentuk dan mengabadikan diri baru setengah abad atau lebih setelah lahirnya agama kristen
5165906 terdapat khayalan yang aneh dan kekanak kanakan dalam injil apokripa mengenai kebangkitan yesus
5165907 ketika ia yesus sedang memberkati mereka ia berpisah dari mereka dan terangkat ke surga kenaikan yesus ke surga terjadi pada hari ia dibangkitkan dari kubur
5165908 selama 40 hari ia yesus berulangkali menampakkan diri dan berbicara kepada mereka tentang kerajaan allah
5165909 ingatlah tatkala allah berfirman wahai isa sesungguhnya aku akan mewafatkan engkau dan mengangkat engkau kepadaku dan membersihkan engkau dari pada orang orang kafir dan akan menjadikan orang orang yang mengikuti engkau lebih tinggi dari orang orang kafir itu sampai hari kiamat maka kepada akulah tempat kembali maka akan aku putuskan nanti di antara kamu dari hal yang telah kamu perselisihkan padanya itu
5165910 tuhan mematikan isa sebagai kematian biasa bukan dibunuh dan tuhan mengangkat derajat orang orang yang mengikutinya lebih tinggi dari orang orang yang menentangnya
5165911 tradisi kristen menurut injil serta pendapat sebagian umat islam menyatakan bahwa nabi isa setelah
5165912 arti yang tepat dari ayat ini ialah bahwa maksud orang orang kafir itu hendak menjadikan isa al masih mati dihukum bunuh sebagai yang dikenal yaitu dipalangkan dengan kayu tidaklah akan berhasil tetapi nabi isa al masih akan wafat dengan sewajarnya dan sesudah beliau wafat beliau akan diangkat tuhan ke tempat yang mulia di sisinya dan bersihkan diri beliau dari pada gangguan orang yang kafir kafir itu
5165913 maka dari itu arti pemahaman dia isa akan diangkat ke sisi tuhan ialah sebagai nabi idris yang diangkat derajatnya ke tempat yang tinggi sebagaimana tersebut di dalam surat maryam surat 19 ayat 57 begitu juga orang yang mati syahid di dalam surat ali imran ayat 169 dikatakan bahwa dia tetap hidup
5165914 golongan ini terhadap golongan pertama yang menyatakan nabi isa telah naik ke langit dan akan turun kembali mereka mengeluarkan kesimpulan hadits hadits itu ialah hadits hadits ahad yang bersangkut paut dengan kepercayaan yang tidaklah dapat diambil kalau tidak qothi tegas padahal perkara ini tidak ada sama sekali hadits yang mutawatir
5165915 bagaimana keadaan nabi isa sekarang dimana tubuh dan nyawanya bagaimana pendapat tuan tentang ayat inni mutawaffika wa rafiuka kalau memang dia sekarang masih hidup sebagaimana di dunia dari mana dia mendapat makanan yang amat diperlukan bagi tubuh jasmani itu sebagaimana yang telah menjadi sunnatullah atas makhluknya
5165916 tidak ada nash yang sharih tegas di dalam bahwa nabi isa telah diangkat dengan tubuh dan nyawa ke langit dan hidup disana seperti di dunia ini sehingga perlu menurut sunnatullah tentang makan dan minum sehingga menimhulkan pertanyaan tentang makanan beliau sehari hari
5165917 tidak ada dalam suatu nash yang sharih dan putus tentang isa a
5165918 hadits hadits yang menyatakan bahwa nabi isa masih hidup jasmani dan ruhani dan akan turun dari langit tidaklah sampai kepada derajat hadits hadits yang mutawatir oleh karena itu maka tidaklah wajib seorang mulim beritikad bahwa isa al masih sekarang hidup dengan tubuh dan nyawanya dan orang yang menjalani aqidah ini tidaklah kafir dari syariat islam
5165919 riwayat riwayat itu adalah kacau balau berlain lain saja lafadnya dan maknanya yang tidak dapat dipertemukan kekacau balauan ini dijelaskan benar benar oleh ulama hadits dan diatas dari itu semua yang membawa riwayat ini ialah wahab bin munabbih dan kaab al ahkbar keduanya itu ialah ahlul kitab yang kemudian memeluk islam
5165920 adapula hadits yang dirawikan abu hurairah tentang nabi isa akan turun apabila hadits itu shahih namun dia adala h hadits ahad dan ulama telah ijma bahwa hadits ahad tidak berfaedah untuk dijadikan dasar aqidah dan tidak sah dipegang dalam urusan yang ghaib
5165921 nabi isa meninggal dunia menurut ajalnya dan diangkat derajat beliau di sisi allah jadi bukan tubuhnya diangkat ke langit
5165922 bahwa isa a s kini masih hidup di langit bukanlah satu kewajiban untuk mempercayainya serta beberapa hadits yang berkaitan dengan kenaikan isa al masih dan akan turunnya kelak menjelang kiamat hadits hadits tersebut walaupun banyak kesemuanya bermuara pada dua orang saja yang keduanya bekas penganut agama kristen yaitu kaab al akhbar dan wahab bin munabbih tidak sedikit ulama yang menilai bahwa informasi mereka pada hakekatnya bersandar dari sisa kepercayaan kedua perowi hadits hadits itu
5165923 dan adalah isa salah seorang yang dekat pada allah minal maqarrabin
5165924 aku tidak pernah mengatakan kepada mereka kecuali apa yang engkau perintahkan mengatakan yaitu sembahlah allah tuhanku dan tuhanmu dan aku menjadi saksi terhadap mereka selama aku berada di tengah tengah rnereka tetapi setelah engkau mewafatkan aku engkaulah yang mengawasi mereka dan engkau pulalah yang menyaksikan segalanya

5165929 a wicked idea floated by musharraf haters send him to neharwali gali in old delhis daryaganj in india where the pakistani general was born and grew up till he was a toddler in an undivided india
5165930 according to pakistani writer tariq ali sanctuaries in manhattan texas and the turkish island of b y kada are being considered for musharraf
5165931 would prefer a large estate in pakistan preferably near a golf course
5165932 us secretary of state condoleezza rice more than hinted that musharraf is not welcome in the u s as a political refugee ironically musharrafs safest option is probably saudi arabia to where he exiled his current nemesis nawaz sharief but the whisky swilling dog loving media crazy dictator is not the ideal guest for the fundamentalist kingdom
5165933 most of what you see is his input along with mine said mr husain as a team of labourers slaved beneath the blistering sun he has gone into the detail he has been part of it and comes here to look at things mr husain a family friend of the musharrafs said the presidents wife sehba had chosen the curtains and fittings for the house estimated at 1 25 million

5165949 for a young kid i feel sorry for him because hes all that we got
5165950 hes good enough to come through but we have to try to protect him a little bit and get him through this first game
5165951 im out there on the field i hear whats happening in the huddle
5165952 i hear some of the confusions so im closer to it
5165953 after a couple snaps i relaxed a little more and got into a rhythm
5165954 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5165955 we are on a clear road towards nato membership for georgia
5165956 i am looking forward to the speedy withdrawal of russian troops which has not yet happened as we had expected
5165957 to show that we support the georgian people and also the government to deal with the work there is to do
5165958 the security zone is temporary this is not disputed by any of the parties
5165959 it is more important that foreign observers arrive so it is not only troops of the commonwealth of independent states cis

5165969 let the little children come to me dont stop them for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these
5165970 dont ever talk badly about their dad allow them to talk well of him
5165971 how the biological mom and dad navigate life for the entire future of their childs life
5165972 is the most critical part of the child having an opportunity to thrive versus just surviving or continuing in the brokenness and woundedness resulting from their parents divorce
5165973 most children of divorce do struggle with loving mom and loving dad and being able to express that in their everyday life
5165974 a lot of times kids act like theyre not listening but theyre hearing everything you say
5165975 intentionally find things in the other parent that you can say are positive point them out to the child give the child permission to love the other parent
5165976 forgiveness gives parents the ability to co parent without all the emotional drama without rehashing the past without hatred
5165977 i didnt want to spend the next 20 years of my life looking back pointing blame asking unanswerable questions
5165978 forgiveness becomes a gift to the parent to their children and to every other relationship in their life
5165979 why take so much energy grocery listing what he did wrong
5165980 just transact the business which is the business of supporting a child
5165981 to get sidelined into personal or marital issues and keep the conversation always and only on the children
5165982 remember that just because someone was not a very good spouse a child still deserves to get to love their parent
5165983 and this not so great spouse is a much loved parent
5165984 there is not a one size fits all answer to every complication in co parenting
5165985 but there are some foundational truths for communicating between parents and the lifelong effects
5165986 life was a story about me because i was in every scene
5165987 we are all fallen creatures and all very hard to live with
5165988 how good and pleasant it is when brothers can live together
5165989 the physical presence of other christians is a source of incomparable joy and strength to the believer
5165990 the more genuine and the deeper our community becomes the more will everything else between us recede the more clearly and purely will jesus christ and his work become the one and only thing that is vital between us

5166001 we began to log onto the terminals as well as inform the citywide dispatch supervisor that we were activating oem at this time and operations were to begin
5166002 they were telling us that we had a plane hit us in the pentagon and we now realized we were under attack wtc 7 could have been a target it could have been a serious target
5166003 with a very confused look he said who told you that
5166004 i found chief ganci we got a message that the buildings are going to collapse
5166005 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with bernies wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
5166006 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the pre eminentcomedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great
5166007 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
5166008 however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her

5166191 the formation of gorkhaland in the nepalese dominated tracts of darjeeling hills will not harm the majority bengali interests in the plains
5166192 during the independence movement when the entire hills was deeply involved in ousting british and demanding for statehood within indian union the then unified communist party was in full support of a separate statehood for darjeeling hills
5166193 it is true that the state government is greatly worried about the gorkhaland movement in the hills the involvement of the maoists could completely change the dimensions and leap frog the movement into a major political crisis in the nation which could be good for those who are vying for gorkhaland as gorkhaland will finally be put into the national agenda
5166194 maoists involvement in the gorkhaland movement as dangerous and intended to destabilize the state the entire north east and subsequently the entire nation maoists insurgency in the hills will at all cost be contended and nipped at the bud

5166270 ifc is partnering with kyrgyz banks to develop the countrys microfinance industry this will help the bank diversify its loan portfolio and grow stronger while at the same time creating opportunities for people to grow their businesses
5166271 ifc wants to help bai tushum make housing more affordable for people in the kyrgyz republic we are optimistic that our support will strengthen bai tushums mortgage business making it a model for other kyrgyz financial institutions
5166272 engage with the microfinance sector on a commercially viable and sustainable basis not as philanthropy the strategy exploits hsbcs strengths and focuses the business on its existing products and operations such as cash and liquidity management collections receivables currency remittances and cards
5166273 it confirms the faith of the microfinance industry that this business can be financially sustainable even while meeting the social objective of financial inclusion
5166274 we are particularly excited about arohans commitment to understand and satisfy client requirements through appropriate product design and high levels of customer service delivered in a cost efficient manner
5166275 in collaboration with other foundations and commercial banks provide start up capital to directly invest through equity or grants in scalable urban growth oriented microfinance institutions to make a diverse range of financial services accessible
5166276 clinicians must reinvent the medical record in order to stimulate the adoption of electronic medical records
5166277 when we started talking about this series there was an immediate recognition with people a kind of this is happening to me
5166278 kids are coming home the cost of living the cost of real estate in major cities is so crazy that for kids to get that step up in life they are going back home to parents to breathe and get a bit of financial relief
5166279 every home is a haven of hopes and dreams secrets and stories
5166280 when you start anything like this you sit down and ask what is the engine of a series if its a police or medical drama its the crime or the disease of the week but as anyone who is in a family knows the family is a pretty powerful engine in itself in terms of dramatic opportunities
5166281 that style of drama is something i think we all love perhaps not consciously but it does reflect our collective view of the world
5166282 in the case of packed to the rafters this is very affirming in its view of families theyre not perfect but there is this good solid core
5166283 bevan wanted to make a show about empty nesters and the idea of the kids coming back home to live
5166284 we went back in and looked at the document did quite a bit more work on that and thought a lot more about the characters who these people were and where to take them
5166285 we threw a lot of names around seeing who were potential starters we also wanted some marquee names in those two roles
5166286 we did a lot of different workshops with different contenders for the roles of the kids
5166287 you can test people individually but its only once you get them in the room and see the various permutations that you see how that chemistry works or does not work
5166288 and see how they are working the casting the chemistry or not between them all the physical locations costumes the sets and the story
5166289 i think its essential and i cant believe everybody doesnt pilot
5166290 its not a luxury its essential if you look at the overall investment youre making in a drama series the potential risk of reshooting an episode is expensive but thats a lot cheaper than getting to the end of a series and realising you had fundamental problems up front
5166291 once that machine starts and youre filming every day its hard to get in and make changes so the pilot gives you a chance to draw breath ask some tough questions about the show what you like what you want to fix what you want to make better
5166292 we didnt recast a single character from the pilot to the series because wed spent a lot of time making sure we got those relationships right
5166293 this is the world of the rafters so you have to think about the values of the rafters its their world view if you understand the characters well enough thats what drives the tone its how they would respond to a situation
5166294 particularly when times are tough family is always a haven its somewhere you feel safe and somewhere you go back to to regroup
5166295 were so ready for this one to be born there is nothing more we can do now its in the hands of the audience
5166296 healthcare providers should direct people facing serious illness or injury to a single high quality website that is comprehensive and regularly updated by objective unbiased experts
5166297 patients need to be trained to use the websites they are referred to the sites need to be more inclusive and contain not only information but support services and tools to help patients think through their situation
5166298 its the only 2 megpixel color camera on the market that delivers 60 images every second and thats just the beginning
5166299 this is more than an hd visualization tool for a microscope its a comprehensive imaging solution that requires no image capture software and very little training
5166300 have created the first personalized stem cells for patients with
5166301 by rewinding their skin cells to an embryonic state according to a study published thursday in the online edition of science
5166302 human versions of the so called induced pluripotent stem ips cells had only been made from skin samples provided by healthy subjects
5166303 were able to reprogram the cells into a type of adult stem cell and from that into nerve cells
5166304 what we now have in the culture dish is cells that have the same genetic makeup as the als patient and they are the same cells that are affected by the disease
5166305 means that for the first time scientists hope to be able to observe the development of the disease in the cells and from that possibly begin studies of treatments
5166306 there is no way we could go to an als patient and take these cells
5166307 neural cells were derived by the team using a method first developed by shinya yamanaka a researcher at kyoto university in japan
5166308 involves inserting four different genes into the skin cells causing them to revert to a primordial state similar to embryonic stem cells
5166309 immediate potential of the method is that it will reveal the chemical and molecular changes that occur in motor neurons before they degenerate
5166310 to test libraries of chemical compounds on the cells to see if they can intervene in this process
5166311 are now looking for alternative methods of reprogramming cells without using viruses
5166312 success at what researchers have long been racing to do create in the laboratory a plentiful supply of cells that have the same genetic makeup as a patient with a particular disease
5166313 had planned to create genetically matched stem cells through cloning patients cells a process that not only involves some medical risk to women who serve as egg donors but also requires the destruction of embryos
5166314 skin fibroblasts from the 82 year old patient with familial als to express four oncogenes including klf4 sox2 oct4 and c myc
5166315 a fter the oncogene retroviral transformation the researchers chose colonies that developed from the cells for the rest of their studies
5166316 treated them with retinoic acid and an agent that stimulates the so called sonic hedgehog cell differentiation pathway
5166317 resulting cells carried numerous markers of natural human motor neurons
5166318 carried a mutation in the superoxide dismutase gene that causes a hereditary slowly progressing form of als
5166319 experiments with cells from mice carrying sod1 mutations suggest that support cells called astrocytes release a toxic factor that kills the motor neurons

5166494 an unhappy columnist who writes what seems to me a plea for help and who confesses she is indeed in trouble should not be kept in harness by a newspaper hoping to win extra sales from her growing despair

5166539 it had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry it was approximately two miles from the runway
5166540 we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft which was also hoping to land at coventry

5166547 i hope you cant sleep and you dream about it
5166548 i will handle the issue within the party this only reflects that there are opinion differences among party leaders and it shows the democratic process does exist and we will discuss the matter within the party
5166549 me along with the rest of the company dancers are absolutely determined to keep this ballet alive one way or another
5166550 its possible we could make up that deficit by the end of the year
5166551 you dont have to worry that if theyre wearing a different color someone could get shot its not happening here
5166552 gang affiliation is cultural in so much that young people involved with gangs often have family members involved with gangs
5166553 when families move you can assume that the gangs will follow
5166554 there was a big emphasis on stopping gang activity giving our young folks things to do like sports and education we banded together and had great success
5166555 i could support changing the program but it is important they have something in comin ups place
5166556 its not like opening a 7 eleven on the corner you have to find the right place
5166557 if gangs are becoming more of an issue its important we know about it
5166558 the weakening korean won continues to trigger additional air cargo demand from korean exporters
5166559 that a lot of these guys are dead shot killed
5166560 so you gonna let me have a go on that thing
5166561 how did a supermarket paper beat other news media to the biggest political scandal of the day
5166562 cobiella asked if this is such scoop and this was first out several ed note nine months ago why didnt others pick up on it
5166563 that is the sixty four thousand million dollar question isnt it
5166564 the national enquirer gives the story cooties for all the times and boston globes the washington posts of the world that is partly because thirty years forty fifty years ago the national enquirer was very different than today it is this low brow celebrity scandal mongering thing
5166565 stop stop i dont want to go there i do not like it
5166566 and theres some places i dont want to go and in this case we really have tried to stay away from that aspect of the story
5166567 i want to hit the news element of the story i want to hit the fact that a man running for president had an affair and then lied about it to the american public and you know darn near blew up his own political party while doing it
5166568 we have other issues and besides he denied it and we swallowed it
5166569 we only have the indonesian flag left as the decoration is it okay for you
5166570 and then one little thing happened and then the club looks bad
5166571 to me that says that theres something wrong with the system not with the kids that somehow the system is failing to capture their imaginations or to transmit to them the importance of staying in school or even making them feel that there are possibilities for them within the school system
5166572 we need to be passionate about 100 percent of students graduating from high school
5166573 theyre going to be competing in a global society not just with someone down the street and if they dont have a high school education its going to be increasingly difficult
5166574 we need to start as early as their first year of high school start working with them in ninth grade making sure they have a personal graduation plan
5166575 if all they need is a half credit of government theyre not going to enroll for a full complement of classes
5166576 but they might enroll in night school or the credit recovery program
5166577 i think anytime you have one high school the kids are less likely to become lost
5166578 its hard for a young person to maintain that motivation when they fail multiple times
5166579 but if they drop out of school theres little hope of success
5166580 i dont have to defend anything the 2004 medal is mine nobody can take it away
5166581 i am here to shoot for the 2008 medal we are all doing the same trying to shoot for that gold the legs feel good im ready to go
5166582 but i too have my expectations and i havent come here to be second
5166583 its going to take guts heart and power if you want to medal you have got to run a smart race probably the best race of your life
5166584 the first few issues will be on the news rack so i want the cover to really be promotional
5166585 the first cover has a lot of action and attitude not tra ditional poses and the strategy is to position this magazine as a lifestyle title rather than a transportation title so that it gets that top rack space at stores such as barnes amp noble
5166586 the horse fills a pretty strong niche in the chopper scene and we were thinking we could grab another niche if we try
5166587 the print media arena is risky now but i think this would be considered an affordable luxury by the young adults were targeting hopefully it will capture their interests because the magazines that usually target that age group are not edgy but were going to try to be edgier with a look at the under ground culture
5166588 all day youve been looking at me constantly and ive been wondering why
5166589 yeah you are and basically you are the reason why derrick and i broke up
5166590 he saw you staring and immediately started to get insecure so i told him how are you ever suppose to ever deal with me being a model or actress he said that there was a good chance he could not deal with it so we both agreed it was over
5166591 thats a hard pill to swallow when you have a big chunk of your life taken away more than 25 percent of my life was spent suffering for a crime i didnt do being locked up in a cage
5166592 if i was guilty and if i was out there living i would have said lets just leave this thing alone
5166593 i pushed for the trial i thought they were going to drop it
5166594 my mother and father died with their son a convicted child molester they couldnt see
5166595 heard the voice of god to help this young man
5166596 if i had a dollar for everytime someone took a picture of that mural id be rich
5166597 the ones alive are not far from being up there for real
5166598 we hadnt shown a growth mode for years its been like a treadmill
5166599 as fast as we lost industrial demand we gained power demand
5166600 it worked out pretty well now were in a growth mode and the question is how do we balance this growth mode that seems to have some legs
5166601 now before you become concerned about longer term natural gas prices as a result of the sheer size of the haynesville please remember some likely natural constraints to the plays growth
5166602 plus increasing demand from the u s power sector should be sufficient in our view to prevent a u s gas glut from developing
5166603 we see the overall total barnett field gas production peaking in 2009
5166604 therefore new resource plays will have to be the growth driver after 2009
5166605 when you view supply growth in this context the possible emergence of new domestic resource play is more digestible
5166606 we maintain a business strategy and production plan based on a long term view we dont let short term variations in the market dictate our plans
5166607 shes my friend im not bothering her shes my friend
5166608 i already put four quarters in it should only say eight more
5166609 no not eight twelve it says twelve go ahead put money in
5166610 i already did and its not showing the money i put in wheres the manager
5166611 go talk to that man over there the black man
5166612 put your clothes in another machine and ill reimburse you four quarters was it
5166613 no five i put in another one because that woman told me to
5166614 im so sorry the machines fine its all fine im so sorry it was me it was my mistake it needed sixteen quarters not twelve
5166615 i was just in such a hurry i dont know what i was thinking
5166616 its okay im here for you i got you covered
5166617 youre just way ahead of it slow down and it will catch up with you
5166618 no but if you dont use theres no chance of her going up there
5166619 john mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption shows how far he is willing to go to win
5166620 despite all of his rhetoric about reform mccains willingness to accept money raised by tainted abramoff cronies like ralph reed shows that mccain simply cannot be trusted to bring change to washington politics
5166621 john mccain says he takes the high road and then he comes to atlanta and chows down on shrimp cocktail with an unindicted co conspirator
5166622 senator mccain knows exactly how ralph reed helped jack abramoff defraud indian tribes out of tens of millions of dollars
5166623 senator mccain should spare himself any further embarrassment by canceling this event immediately
5166624 raises serious questions about why he mccain didnt bring ralph reed before his committee was he concerned it would undercut his presidential campaign now you see ralph reed raising money for his campaign
5166625 ralph reed is not part of our fund raising organization in the state of georgia nor is he part of this event
5166626 i take the long view of politics which is that yesterdays opponent can be tomorrows friend or ally
5166627 i have found this to be the case with senator mccain i am supporting him because he is running on principled conservative positions on taxes judges terrorism energy values and the family i hold no position title or official role in the mccain campaign and am not seeking one
5166628 i was very intrigued when i heard reports that ralph reed was actively fund raising for mccain
5166629 i was curious as to whether or not senator mccain knew that ralph reed was actively fund raising for him
5166630 the whole process on both sides of the aisle is getting so politically charged
5166631 someone can certainly take issue with ralph reeds politics or his conservative views
5166632 but i would hate to think senator mccain would decline ralphs effort to recruit some people to attend a fund raiser in atlanta ralph has friends and he has enemies anyone whos been in politics for long the same could be said
5166633 im still pro life and im still in favor of marriage being between one man and one woman and i would like the next president who will select justices for the next supreme court to agree
5166634 one man and as many wives as he could afford
5166635 hey i coulda made it rain in denver on 8 28 08 but nobody asked me to
5166636 dont leave money on the table dont let anyone leave the table
5166637 how much money are you making who cares if you have a million users if you are losing money each month
5166638 nuestra preocupaci n es prestar asistencia a los heridos y familiares de las v ctimas
5166639 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
5166640 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5166641 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5166642 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5166643 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5166644 i just see the image of this family in american suburbia loading their kid into a suburban and driving them to school thats whats been going on
5166645 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5166646 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else
5166647 weve got a water dog so coming today seemed like a good idea
5166648 there are just so many things happening for dogs these days that as much as wed love to we cant even get to all of them
5166649 it has been an effort of the whole parish and the culmination of six or seven years of work
5166650 we have a growing community a committed group of parents and a whole group of parishioners enthusiastic about a grade school everything came together at the right time
5166651 now a whole new group will have christ at the center of all of their classes
5166652 it will help parents raise their children in the faith and it is a statement of hope in the future batavia is a vibrant city and its an opportunity to say that we want to be a part of that
5166653 its been a blessing to be able to meet all the parents
5166654 my photography helps people come back to reality the beauty of it
5166655 i have signed three decrees including one on the resignation of the government another on proclamation of a state of emergency in south ossetia and the third on setting up an emergency committee to settle the consequences of the georgian aggression
5166656 people in the mountain areas of the north grow very little rice so flooding like this can badly affect their livelihood
5166657 most of what you see is his input along with mine he has gone into the detail he has been part of it and comes here to look at things
5166658 fly into exile in saudi arabia where he is to remain for the next three months
5166659 they did not constitute sexual relations as i understood that term to be defined
5166660 therere strange things done in the midnight sun by the men who moil for gold
5166661 youre talking to me youre talking to me youre talking to me im the only one here
5166662 just tell me how you do it please we want to get pregnant again but i cannot gain 50 pounds again i just cant ill do anything do you take something
5166663 pinching is a way of controlling the rate of growth of a plant
5166664 its used more to control the overall shape of a plant
5166665 generally youre going to be finished with pinching by the end of june
5166666 cut the plant fairly close to the soil line give it water compost or mulch
5166667 so dont plant it where youll be seeing vast sweeps of brown spent plants for awhile
5166668 its just shocking i cant believe it all these years you have these copper gutters here and come to work one day and theyre gone
5166669 the price of copper has gone up and theyre police assuming thats why
5166670 explained anne carlino building supervisor for the libertyville civic center foundation which operates the building
5166671 somebody had to get up in a very difficult spot to get that gutter off
5166672 we see reports of thieves just taking copper wire off the utility poles
5166673 typically when we see the economy gets a little more tight if theres a profit to be made somebody is going to do it
5166674 unfortunately there is a market for stolen copper and things of that nature
5166675 its going to cost a lot more than that to fix the building
5166676 if we want to maintain our historic status the expectation is we replace them as they originally were on the building
5166677 something like this happening really points out this building is an important structure and its costly when something is taken
5166678 most painful workout there have been too many to pick one
5166679 im not sure people realize the schedules of these swimmers
5166680 its a tough grind in high school most swimmers practice before school and after school
5166681 if you have multiple kids swimming in a meet one is in the morning session and one swims later
5166682 youre at the meet from 6 a m to 9 p m sometimes but thats just how it is and you deal with it
5166683 every kid is watching swimming right now and thats great
5166684 but i wish broadcasters would talk more about phelps regime people dont have any concept how grueling it is
5166685 but swimming is not an easy sport the older kids swim so many laps it takes a lot of dedication
5166686 all of them tried other sports but they all migrated back to swimming
5166687 they made some of their best friends on swim teams and the sport gave them a great work ethic
5166688 football is something you cant do for the rest of your life
5166689 i plan on not getting any sleep or going to bed before midnight until then
5166690 of course then the beatles happened on ed sullivan and everything changed
5166691 it was almost like you had somebody from your own generation all of a sudden you had a contemporary or a peer
5166692 you go back and you look at the old radio playlists and you had all these different things
5166693 today everything is so narrowcast nobody gets any cross pollination which i think is a huge loss
5166694 all i wanted to do was record myself it never occurred to me i could actually have a real studio
5166695 of course everybody wants to do the record in the basement and come up with a grammy
5166696 but thats not going to happen at least i dont think it is
5166697 most of the people that live in naperville and the muslims that live here are professional people
5166698 we mix with them on the same level and theres nothing that singles us out or makes us different
5166699 theres a misconception about what islam stands for and the alleged connection of islam to violence
5166700 when you couple it with the so called war against terror and the focus on global negativity of islam that has made things very difficult for muslims
5166701 this has helped the muslim community mature faster in the united states and build up their own identity
5166702 it is hard to find a good balance between how much you can afford and what is good for your kids
5166703 i dont think that people really focus on the issues of affordability and access of child care for young children
5166704 we want to help policymakers and elected officials understand the issue
5166705 i see this as a vehicle to educate the public and create new advocates
5166706 unless they bring some comprehensive changes in the security this deployment will not affect peoples confidence
5166707 people are afraid to leave their house after 7 p m
5166708 i am still a student but this was an order from the commander of the academy that we should come out and search the vehicles
5166709 orang kristen menganngap kalau keimanan mereka baik namun keyakinan lain berbahay mereka juga memandang keyakinan komunis juga berbahaya bagi saya semua keyakinan berbahaya
5166710 kita semua ateis saya hanya percaya lebih sedikit tuhan dari anda saat anda memahami kenapa anda menolak semua tuhan selain tuhan anda anda akan paham mengapa saya menolak tuhan anda
5166711 penderitaan agama adalah disaat yang sama pernyataan penderitaan nyata dan sebuah protes melawan penderitaan yangnyata agama adalah pandangan dari orang orang tertekan hati dari dunia tanpa hati dan jiwa dari kondisi kondisi tanpa jiwa ia adalah candu masyarakat
5166712 mungkin kalau banyak para pemimpin agama besar memiliki gangguan temporal lobe dan ini membuat mereka merasa memiliki visi dan pengalaman mistik
5166713 sebuah keyakinan tetap idiosinkretis tidak biasa dalam kebudayaan yang dimiliki seseorang
5166714 model evolusioner setiap potongnya sama indahnya sama cerdasnya sama memuaskan secara moral dengan mitos kisah dan konsep teologi yang menua dan mereka dapat menjelaskan meramalkan dan diterapkan dalam lingkup penting dan berguna secara social
5166715 langfristig ist das sicher richtig so wie wir langfristig auch eine bessere welt wollen
5166716 man k nnte ja mit dem abbau des verfassungsschutzes so anfangen dass man diejenigen die uns bespitzeln herausrechnet
5166717 dass man dem biologisch m glichen optimum von 120 jahren sehr nahe kommen kann
5166718 unser gr tes problem ist dass es zu wenig barrierefrei zug nglichen wohnraum gibt
5166719 der wohnungsmarkt reagiert nur sehr z gerlich auf die ver nderten anforderungen die eine alternde gesellschaft stellt
5166720 all of us in new york hollywood and across the country should be concerned about how this failure to reach an agreement is impacting our members
5166721 they have already suffered significantly as a result of the writers guild of america strike and now they are experiencing an additional loss of work made worse when they can find a job by having to work without a contract under old terms and conditions
5166722 there are some who feel we have all the time in the world to make this deal
5166723 this advisory motion is not in the best interests of new york division sag members or any sag members across the country
5166724 it could delay and prolong the negotiations by emboldening management with a false belief that sag actors are split on the issues
5166725 i dont want to sound like im a sore loser but i think those two other girls were using their arms

5166736 aar shareholders and senior russian executives inside tnk bp had repeatedly raised concerns with robert dudley and bp regarding the companys failure to adhere to russian laws including labour regulations

5166739 mick davis is a very clever man he has very cleverly put a bid on the table reflecting a movement of metals prices generally but we are in a different niche and it is a very good niche
5166740 there is an awful lot of doom and gloom in the stock markets and cash is king you cannot expect people not to take a pile of cash when it is on the table
5166741 we are concerned that shareholders because of the general state of the markets may be tempted to accept an offer that would deprive them of exposure to a hugely attractive business in a hugely attractive industry
5166742 platinum group metals should be disconnected from all other metals two months ago the stronger for longer price scenario based on infrastructure growth in china and india was to a certain extent exploded and metals prices fell off a cliff and platinum was no exception
5166743 but the dynamics that drive the platinum price are completely different to those that drive copper steel and iron ore
5166744 the platinum price is driven by the number of cars put on the road and the ever tightening emissions regulations in every country in the world
5166745 over the last several years i have expected mick davis to come calling i always thought that when that happened seeing as there are only three major platinum producers in the world there would be a feeding frenzy
5166746 has taken a couple of obvious would be buyers out of the picture

5166759 during the recent retail price increases by supplier companies the lack of transparency around the profitability of their supply and generation arms has led to confusion in the media and among the wider public
5166760 how can a company which has been making good profits overall be justified in increasing its retail prices even with record commodity prices
5166761 my view is that the lack of transparency as to the accounts of our major energy supply companies is potentially problematic both in terms of the reputation of the industry itself and in terms of good policy making
5166762 i would be particularly interested to hear your views on the merits of requiring vertically integrated energy companies to report the accounts of their supply and generation businesses separately

5166777 people are here today because they are interested in french culture so this is amazing for us
5166778 most of the people that live in naperville and the muslims that live here are professional people
5166779 we mix with them on the same level and theres nothing that singles us out or makes us different
5166780 theres a misconception about what islam stands for and the alleged connection of islam to violence
5166781 when you couple it with the so called war against terror and the focus on global negativity of islam that has made things very difficult for muslims
5166782 this has helped the muslim community mature faster in the united states and build up their own identity
5166783 ive been playing ever since i was in junior high i have always played in bands
5166784 a lot of the stuff that theyre doing now is stuff that they did back in the 50s and 60s with a different twist on the rhythm and on the distortion
5166785 when youre feeling down you just mess around and it feels good
5166786 i like rock because its loud and its fast and its kind of crazy all at the same time
5166787 i just like bands that have great guitar players pretty much
5166788 i took lessons at el rey and now shes taking lessons at el rey so its kind of an institution

5166791 the remoteness probably helps the criminals i would think somebody could stash a car make their way through the woods and after the robbery easily get away without being detected
5166792 if you do your homework you figure out how to stash the car and go through the woods who is going to find you on foot

5166795 it is fascinating when a hedge fund is having someone on its behalf go out to beat the bushes to find perspective buyers
5166796 youve got an activist who is taking more extraordinary steps than usual
5166797 banks take on a degree of reputational risk particularly when theyre advising a hedge fund

5166799 most painful workout there have been too many to pick one
5166800 im not sure people realize the schedules of these swimmers
5166801 its a tough grind in high school most swimmers practice before school and after school
5166802 if you have multiple kids swimming in a meet one is in the morning session and one swims later
5166803 youre at the meet from 6 a m to 9 p m sometimes but thats just how it is and you deal with it
5166804 every kid is watching swimming right now and thats great
5166805 but i wish broadcasters would talk more about phelps regime people dont have any concept how grueling it is
5166806 but swimming is not an easy sport the older kids swim so many laps it takes a lot of dedication
5166807 all of them tried other sports but they all migrated back to swimming
5166808 they made some of their best friends on swim teams and the sport gave them a great work ethic
5166809 football is something you cant do for the rest of your life

5166833 often lost admidst the mesmerizing tapestry of faith groups that comprise the american population is also a vast and growing population of those without faith
5166834 the present survey has detected a wide and possibly growing swath of secularism among americans the magnitude and role of this large secular segment of the american population is frequently ignored by scholars and politicians alike
5166835 in all sixteen percent 16 described their outlook as secular or somewhat secular while seventy five percent 75 described their outlook as religious or somewhat religious
5166836 the greatest increase in absolute as well as in percentage terms has been among those adults who do not subscribe to any religious identification

5166838 some democrats seem to think that beating sen elizabeth dole r is simple its not
5166839 the incumbent and her campaign team are savvy as evidenced by her television onslaught a few months back that built her a comfortable polling lead state sen kay hagan is a good candidate and the democratic senatorial campaign committee dscc is already showing their financial commitment to this contest but its still a very tough road
5166840 please note senator john edwards is no longer affiliated with this center and cannot be reached at this number
5166841 thank you and we look forward to speaking with you
5166842 this type of outreach is critical to increasing the influence and strength of this underserved population in this years and future elections

5166844 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama

5166854 the goal of the party convention is that people leave with a clear idea of what the choices are between the two candidates and two political parties
5166855 from his background he has a deep understanding of what american families face
5166856 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5166857 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5166858 i was very shocked to receive the bad news that my sister had been shot and killed in cold blood not far from the satellite station
5166859 as we go out preaching the gospel against violence some people who claim to be men are going out killing our people we have to stop them in their tracks once and for all
5166860 but i think you take an example like bosnia when we went in and undoubtedly saved lives we did not have u n approval but there was a strong international case that had been made that ethnic cleansing was taking place and under those circumstances when we have it within our power we should you know we should take action
5166861 whereas iraq persists in violating resolutions of the united nations security council by continuing to engage in brutal repression of its civilian population thereby threatening international peace and security in the region
5166862 i believe in roe v wade and i come to that conclusion not because im pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually i think they they wrestle with these things in profound ways in consultation with their pastors or their spouses or their doctors or their family members
5166863 so then sen obama youre against federal funding for embryonic stem cell research right not exactly
5166864 que yo sepa el nico que habl con l diputado espinoza es marcelo schilling
5166865 it is hard to find a good balance between how much you can afford and what is good for your kids
5166866 i dont think that people really focus on the issues of affordability and access of child care for young children
5166867 we want to help policymakers and elected officials understand the issue
5166868 i see this as a vehicle to educate the public and create new advocates
5166869 its just shocking i cant believe it all these years you have these copper gutters here and come to work one day and theyre gone
5166870 the price of copper has gone up and theyre police assuming thats why
5166871 explained anne carlino building supervisor for the libertyville civic center foundation which operates the building
5166872 somebody had to get up in a very difficult spot to get that gutter off
5166873 we see reports of thieves just taking copper wire off the utility poles
5166874 typically when we see the economy gets a little more tight if theres a profit to be made somebody is going to do it
5166875 unfortunately there is a market for stolen copper and things of that nature
5166876 its going to cost a lot more than that to fix the building
5166877 if we want to maintain our historic status the expectation is we replace them as they originally were on the building
5166878 something like this happening really points out this building is an important structure and its costly when something is taken

5166896 im not going to talk about conversations with the campaign
5166897 i think that would be up to first of all john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5166898 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5166899 pour les s ries cela ne devrait pas tre un gros probl me mais sil ny a pas dam lioration cela aura certainement une influence
5166900 going into week 3 this is the only game that we game plan in the preseason
5166901 the rest of the games we just kind of do what were doing that week so we throw in the full game plan and we treat it like the regular season
5166902 when guys are in the training room theyre not out here practicing youve got to be willing to release them and live with it and pick up other people for more competition
5166903 i wouldnt expect a resolution any time soon but we will get these guys we will hunt them down
5166904 we may get a few extra false alarms i dont have a problem processing those

5166907 you dont have a good escape path many of the roads in barrington hills are dead end streets if someone becomes aware of your presence you have no way out
5166908 of course then the beatles happened on ed sullivan and everything changed
5166909 it was almost like you had somebody from your own generation all of a sudden you had a contemporary or a peer
5166910 you go back and you look at the old radio playlists and you had all these different things
5166911 today everything is so narrowcast nobody gets any cross pollination which i think is a huge loss
5166912 all i wanted to do was record myself it never occurred to me i could actually have a real studio
5166913 of course everybody wants to do the record in the basement and come up with a grammy
5166914 but thats not going to happen at least i dont think it is
5166915 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
5166916 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5166917 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5166918 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5166919 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5166920 i just see the image of this family in american suburbia loading their kid into a suburban and driving them to school thats whats been going on
5166921 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5166922 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else
5166923 just unfurling a banner in tiananmen square took every ounce of courage i had
5166924 in some parts of china 10 000 yuan or about 1 400 is the price of life
5166925 they tried to block the view and asked us why are you doing this then they tried to take our banner
5166926 we said no and they threatened to put us in jail for five days
5166927 na deeglike ondersoeke deur die spesialiste en chirurge is daar tot die gevolgtrekking gekom dat indien hulle nie dadelik opereer nie nathan dit nie deur die nag sal maak nie

5166941 they dont even come to the pool its just like they put their heads down and look at their feet they know whats coming
5166942 you can ride for a longer time you burn more calories and see some of the world while youre doing it
5166943 i saw a guy this morning dropped off by a taxi

5166945 we see a ton more people riding in our neighborhood

5166966 when you want to blather away into the ether collecting the accolades and shunning the negative response youre not advocating for speech to be free youre advocating for talk to be cheap
5166967 a leftist idea can be recognized by three earmarks it will be
5166968 and threaten use of the coercive power of the state to extract compliance
5166969 i could tolerate leftists if they had any coherent ideas for a better way to do things but they dont they cling stubbornly to failed brain fart dreams that have been attempted over and over again with disastrous results but they never learn when better ideas come along they simply screech and holler at them then fling feces like the monkeys they are
5166970 extremism in defense of liberty is no vice moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue
5166971 i have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
5166972 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
5166973 how a politician stands on the second amendment tells you how he or she views you as an individual as a trustworthy and productive citizen or as part of an unruly crowd that needs to be lorded over controlled supervised and taken care of
5166974 i came down on that first downhill and i was charging hard
5166975 i hit the brakes and i think i hit a wet spot because before i knew it i was laying on the ground and rolling down the hill
5166976 i was kind of a little nervous in the first moto watching the gate and all but i guess thats normal once i got out there though i felt pretty good it feels really good
5166977 i wish i had this training when i was there before
5166978 it helps take away the enemys advantage on us i know what i am looking for now
5166979 we give them the ability to think like the enemy
5166980 we can now see if anybody has been there and if we are being tracked
5166981 when people dont get the information or treatment that would allow them to manage illnesses at an early stage or avoid a disease altogether the costs of health care escalate and the burden of expensive late stage medicine often falls to publicly funded health services
5166982 an important strategy to reduce chronic illness and the costs associated with it is through prevention via regular monitoring and educational initiatives
5166983 whether youre legal or illegal its always been assumed that your medical information is private and cant be used against you
5166984 the doctor patient relationship is sacred and im not sure that has really been challenged until now were in uncharted territory
5166985 if people have enough money to send home which is what many of them are doing then theyve got money to pay some of their medical bills
5166986 but health directors have to defend the essential public health services practically every day
5166987 i sincerely believe that this bill puts families at risk on the highways and would result in death or serious injury
5166988 i am deeply concerned about 9 1 2 foot boats meeting a school bus
5166989 the buses travel primarily on rural roads and often in the dark during the early morning and early evening hours
5166990 when there is time to thoughtfully avoid the consequences of this bill
5166991 it kind of breaks my heart but its a good change
5166992 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5166993 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5166994 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5166995 its incredible the lord has blessed us with antibodies our whole lifetime
5166996 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
5166997 i remember when i first saw oceans twelve i didnt get why the jokes were funny it was way too long and the plot was so incomprehensible that i nearly walked out of the theater
5166998 we have beaten germany in the final defeating both real and imagined demons along the way no longer are there ogres or superstitions one can be the favorite and win one can play the ball and live and one can be small and be grand
5166999 we had only three female ring controllers here in the province and they were not even enough but the passing away of maphangule leaves us poorer
5167000 she has walked her mile and she will be sorely missed no one can replace her
5167001 she was always there for all of us and she will always be remembered by the family
5167002 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
5167003 she was once sexually abused by her stepfather and so hates all men
5167004 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
5167005 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
5167006 we have to go to the board and ask for additional money and i believe that they balance the budget by you know transferring it from surpluses in other accounts
5167007 not only does it mean a lot of wear and tear on their cars and they replace their cars fairly often but the increase in gas prices has really been kind of a huge shock every realtor is an independent contractor so all their expenses and things they pay for themselves
5167008 somebody drives a truck up to the store to deliver their product and they give you an invoice and on top of it is a fuel surcharge so weve now also been asked to pay a fuel surcharge from a lot of folks and many of those grocers are refusing to pay for it and theyre just saying look you need to build that into the cost of your business and not slap me with an additional charge
5167009 i think in the short run its likely that well see somewhat of a downward trend in gas prices largely for two reasons i think one the weak economy certainly is affecting it and also as the gas prices have gone up the demand for gas has gone down which has helped put a downward trend on gas prices
5167010 i do have two different social security numbers for you ones corporate and im assuming one is your birth one and the one i have here is xxx xx xxxx that is correct yes do you have any idea on how i would have gotten this information nope
5167011 the only vital record that has a social security number that the public can see is a death record
5167012 you can just go down to the register of deeds and look it up and it actually has your social security number on it that i did not know im just going to read this number and you can let me know you can decline to answer i just want to know if this is your social security number xxx xx xxxx yeah does that surprise you that i found that at the courthouse yes actually it does
5167013 i have no idea if theres a way to change them
5167014 most agencies including our own will redact any personal identifiable information to protect the public and we certainly do that on a routine basis so when it comes to public records that does not mean that anyone can request that personal information and get it
5167015 when you have these documents in a governmental repository and it does require the affirmative step of an individual coming in there looking up the records and then copying down the information or making a copy of the record that serves somewhat as a deterrent
5167016 a man will rise and run until his shoe lace gains independence he shall fall and break the record
5167017 made it clear we wouldnt be leaving until we signed
5167018 ive emailed for a price and will report back once ive gotten one
5167019 oh wow want did you email them for a price with the monitor and the controls and the cabinet and

5167022 good job sixpoints very well stated szab has designed something truly amazing we will no doubt
5167023 it would be really funny then youd find out edith got raped and youd go where in the hell did that came from
5167024 im thinking about trying comedy do you have an open mic night
5167025 no but i have a comic sick tonight can you do about 15 minutes

5167028 vi forventede at mange af bagerierne ikke fulgte reglerne men det er alligevel overraskende at det er s mange
5167029 mange gange sker der det at vi p l gger en indehaver at f re logbog eller at registrere sin virksomhed men s lukker den og skifter ejer og s m vi starte forfra
5167030 det er meget konkurrenceforvridende og en skamplet p branchen at nogle driver forretning p den m de hvis du skal drive et bageri efter reglerne er det benh rdt arbejde n r du ikke betaler alt det du skal som moms og feriepenge er det jo noget lettere
5167031 der er uden tvivl mange flere der ikke f lger reglerne
5167032 i sincerely believe that this bill puts families at risk on the highways and would result in death or serious injury
5167033 i am deeply concerned about 9 1 2 foot boats meeting a school bus
5167034 the buses travel primarily on rural roads and often in the dark during the early morning and early evening hours
5167035 when there is time to thoughtfully avoid the consequences of this bill
5167036 but the bill to bring such reservation in all private higher educational institution is still pending we demand of the
5167037 im not sure it would speak to anyone else except maybe the people in a one block radius but to me its the sound of my neighborhood
5167038 we have an interest in sound and we have an interest in eavesdropping on people
5167039 to build a positive culture with effective communication we need to first of all get the basics right people need to understand what is expected of them and trust has to be built with their employer the employee has to believe that their employer will provide the workplace and support for them to effectively carry out their role and contribute to the performance of the organisation the role of the employer is that they need to provide a safe physical and psychological environment the workplace must encourage and demonstrate good practice standards and good working practice should be encouraged and this starts with the employer when an employer visibly meets their legal responsibilities and provides effective management this sets the standards for everyone else in the organisation we tend to let culture and communications evolve in our organisations this can work when an organisation is small or new however there comes a point e g growth when we must proactively start to drive our culture and communications

5167045 hypsilophodon had elongated legs and a stiffened counterbalancing tail that suggest it was almost certainly a fast runner
5167046 the plates might have functioned to support the ribcage during fast running
5167047 that as the body of the dead hypsilophodon individual rotted and collapsed the bones from the skin came to be closely associated with the internal bones
5167048 our careful reexamination of the specimens shows however that the bony plates are always closely associated with the outside surface of the ribs from the front end of the ribcage and are certainly not armor
5167049 on tuesday we are organising a meeting with trinamool congress chief mamata banerjee the purpose of the meeting is to discuss industrial growth of the state and how to make it happen without people being affected
5167050 this is a very positive move we always look forward to such scopes we welcome this step whole heartedly

5167055 i think indian muslims are in a safer place because the indian muslim has a stake and space in indian democracy
5167056 its a very huge thing that we are part of a democracy and indian muslims can aspire to become a shah rukh khan can aspire to become irfan pathan the president of india and that makes the muslims far more hopeful than those in other parts of the world
5167057 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy
5167058 you cannot only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
5167059 i cannot get a house in mumbai i wanted to buy a flat in mumbai and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan
5167060 now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in mumbai because they are muslims then what are we talking about
5167061 as a threat and muslims as figures of fear and hate
5167062 i think it is i would accept that i dont think that the muslim leadership has bothered to clear the air about what islam actually is
5167063 the community is also allowing itself to listen to the fundamentalists who actually are not their leaders at all
5167064 no no no no jawaharlal nehru was a leader of muslims and thats the way it should be you dont need a muslim leader for that
5167065 you look at all the politicians whether it is atal bihari vajpayee or indira gandhi or anybody the minute its a muslim question you get all the dariwalas bearded people and maulvis only to speak
5167066 there is a resurgence of the moderate liberal voice which is now taking on the affairs of the community
5167067 there were a lot of conspiracy theories and there still are understandably in that part of the world
5167068 i said to the pakistanis you are all going to think this is sabotage but i do not have evidence of that we think its mechanical failure we have looked at the records of the us air force we have found a number of failures maybe 20 or 30 where c130s behaved this way
5167069 we cant wait for a plane to drop out of the sky
5167070 initially i thought maybe it was benazirs brother but no one has ever taken credit for it and those things are not the kind of things you do by yourself pakistan is not the kind of place where those things do not come out
5167071 it seems there was a mechanical failure for a c 130 in colorado and the same thing happened a c 130 had gone into gyrations in the air over colorado it was not as close to the ground they pulled it out
5167072 it was the steering mechanism is the way he described it to me it did not crash but it went through these gyrations up in the air and the pilot pulled it out i had always thought c130s were the workhorses of the air i was quite surprised when the air force described to me what they had discovered
5167073 these pilots did not have much experience flying c130s and they flew so low
5167074 the use of a chemical agent to incapacitate the pilots and thus perpetuate the accident therefore remains a distinct possibility
5167075 they are driving their new platforms heavily and want to keep their momentum going by introducing new products at new prices

5167078 the specific enhancements in this release are in the area of soa and strengthening weblogic for soa
5167079 selective cross pollination of bea features into the first release of 11g
5167080 weve updated wls to support all the latest releases of standards including ws web services standards which are important for building soa infrastructure and applications
5167081 enables true composite application building by making it easier to wire together disparate applications into components
5167082 a standard thats really geared toward allowing single sign on which is near and dear to the hearts of soa folks
5167083 where an application is composed of different parts running on different machines and in different environments
5167084 selectively install components and of those components they can selectively start a subset so they only install and run what they need
5167085 gives users less to break and less to look at when they track problems down
5167086 customers will need to decide whether to go with eclipse jdeveloper or both because oracle designated both as strategic
5167087 before then if you wanted an external optical drive you had to use a proprietary or scsi connector and that wasnt cheap
5167088 whenever you bump up performance by such a great level you open up the opportunities for apps people havent thought of yet
5167089 dont forget this is faster than ethernet so all of a sudden usb 3 becomes a very viable way to connect external drives that will be as fast if not faster than an internal
5167090 some notebooks werent living up to battery life and the only difference was one had a webcam which turned out to be a usb device internally that caused the usb ports to stay active and thus drain the battery
5167091 i am confident that none of the documents have been released
5167092 i was shocked that something like this would occur i never dreamed it would i deeply regret that this happened
5167093 the camera pans the cocktail glass behind a blind of plastic plants i found the lady with the fat diamond ring then you know i cant remember a damn thing i think its one of those de ja vu things or a dream thats tryin to tell me something or will i ever stop thinkin about it i dont know i doubt it subterranean by design i wonder what i would find if i met you let my eyes caress you until i meet the thought of missess princess who often wonder what makes her work i guess ill leave that question to the experts assuming that there are some out there theyre probably alone solitaire i can remember when i caught up with a pastime intimate friend she said bet youre probably gonna say i look lovely but you probably dont think nothin of me she was right though i cant lie shes just one of those corners in my mind and i just put her right back with the rest thats the way it goes i guess baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you careless whisper from a careless man a neutron dance for a neutron fan marionette strings are dangerous things i thought of all the trouble they bring an eye for an eye a spy for a spy rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh tell me that shes not dreaming shes got an ace in the hole it doesnt have meaning reality used to be a friend of mine cause complete control i dont take too kind christina applegate you gotta put me on guess whos piece of the cake is jack gone she broke her wishbone and wished for a sign i told her whispers in my heart were fine what did she think she could do i feel for her i really do and i stared at the ring finger on her hand i wanted her to be a big pm dawn fan but i had to put her right back with the rest thats the way it goes i guess baby you send me set adrift on memory bliss of you
5167094 equality in job loss women are increasingly vulnerable during recessions
5167095 it now appears that unlike in decades past families can no longer rely on womens employment to help boost family income during a downturn
5167096 families are more economically vulnerable as wives are no longer insulating families from economic hardship in times of higher unemployment and falling or stagnant real wages
5167097 the remarkable fact is that this is going to be the first recession from one peak to the next that weve seen a decrease
5167098 because of this women may be more susceptible to the impact of the business cycle than they were when they were more highly concentrated in a smaller number of noncyclical occupations like teaching and nursing
5167099 in the past two economic downturns as job losses have forced women out of the workplace a sort of angel has appeared to guide their way and re label their unfortunate circumstances as virtuous
5167100 im so glad that at long last this fiction has been officially acknowledged
5167101 after the hoopla over this report blows over i suppose well return to parsing the reasons why upper middle class women blow 100k on an advanced degree and then sit at home im paying for mine i fully intend to use it as far as im concerned they can choose whatever rationale they want as long as it doesnt stick to the majority of women who dont even have a choice
5167102 the issue is not a woman genuinely choosing to stay home the issue is the way that women either are forced into that choice or assumed to be making that choice freely when the reality is that market and cultural realities force that choice upon them
5167103 equality in job loss women are increasingly vulnerable to layoffs during recessions
5167104 when we saw women starting to drop out in the early part of this decade we thought it was the motherhood movement women staying home to raise their kids we did not think it was the economy but when we looked into it we realized that it was
5167105 a seemingly small decline but those 2 2 percentage points erase more than 12 years of gains for women
5167106 many states have established special investigative units or task forces on child predators
5167107 few states have devoted similar investigative resources toward cracking down on internet fraud
5167108 internet crime costs basically nothing to execute can be highly lucrative and involves little risk of being caught and punished we need all 50 state attorneys general focused on this problem
5167109 preoccupied with the need to build up the blockade fleet secretary of the navy welles did not at first want to experiment with newfangled notions but rumors of rebel activities caused congress to force his hand with a low of august 3 1861 directing the construction of three prototype ironclads welles set up a naval board to assess the dozens of proposals no bid came from john ericsson the irascible genius of marine engineering who had contributed the screw propeller and several other innovations to ship design bitter about earlier feuds with the navy ericsson sulked in his new york office until a shipbuilder persuaded him to submit his radical design to the navy department ericssons proposal incorporated several novel features a wooden hull sheathed with thin iron plate would be overlaid by a flat deck 172 feet long with perpendicular sides extending below the waterline and protected by 4 5 inch armor plating the propeller anchor and all vital machinery would be protected by this shell which was designed to float with less than two feet of freeboard giving the craft the appearance of a raft and also presenting a small target to enemy fire sitting ont the dect was ericssons most important innovation a revolving turret encased in eight inches of armor and containing two eleven inch guns this turret along with the shallow draft 11 feet light displacement 1 200 tons about one fourth of the virginias displacement and eight knot speed would give ericssons ship maneuverability and versatility she could almost literally dance around a heavier enemy and fire in any direction
5167110 the loan waiver largely remains on the paper because of the fund crunch being faced by the district central cooperative banks
5167111 the farmers were also badly stressed because of the inadequate or spurious supply of fertilizers particularly di ammonium phosphate dap and such factors combined with the state governments illogical eligibility criteria for the loan waiver and fresh credit and procedural delays drove farmers to private moneylenders again making nonsense of the whopping loan waiver and a fresh credit plan of the government that has dazzled the world
5167112 even the nationalized banks have given loans to farmers who presented no objection certificates from the dcc branches that were unable to advance loan
5167113 from now on our girls will be freed after their initiation rites so they can go to school

5167119 a very clear cut demonstration of the wisdom of the leadership of augusta for looking into a trolley system that in every city that has one is subsidized from that citys general fund and ignoring a proven economic engine in the proposed ellis street option
5167120 traffic engineer steve cassell projected the cost of the ellis street project 10 years from now and that made it look like it would cost 300 million instead of the 150 million ballpark figure we were looking at
5167121 a canal is the craziest thing ive ever heard about
5167122 it would cost too much money to do if they want to do something with the canal let them improve the canal we already have
5167123 we dont need a trolley and we dont need a canal down ellis street
5167124 when i was a child i used to ride on a trolley in augusta we needed it we dont need it now
5167125 if people need to get from the medical center to broad street maybe they could walk and get a little exercise
5167126 after all were one of the fattest nations in the world
5167127 i dont see the funding coming we cant seem to run our transit system id rather see us improve service there i dont know how a trolley is going to be paid for it cant be paid for out of the general fund and i dont see another revenue source
5167128 i would prefer seeing the trolley because in other cities you go into the transportation is much easier
5167129 its much more conducive to the communities and much more conducive for the people in those different cities so im more in favor of the trolleys right now more so than that canal
5167130 personally i think the trolleys got a better shot theres a lot of information coming forth theres studies being made and from my perspective the trolleys got a pretty good shot
5167131 i think the trolley would be a 100 percent blessing to augusta it would move people from one end to another when we have problems with the parking and stuff we can move them around with a trolley and all the businesses will survive off of that from building to building from broad street to the hospital
5167132 i think the trolley idea is a good one that idea about the canal running down ellis street was totally impractical and how that didnt get shelved in five minutes i dont know i mean that was just an idiotic idea but the trolley idea i think might have some possibilities if you confine it to the local area
5167133 its not a good financial move not at this time trolleys are beautiful but how many people downtown would actually use a trolley maybe for a short time when the idea is new
5167134 i dont like either one of them its too much money weve got a whole lot more problems to face right now than whether weve got water or a trolley downtown
5167135 i dont think a canal would work trolleys would probably be helpful if they ran on electricity but a canal down ellis street i dont like that idea
5167136 the money i spend on a day is increasing almost daily but the money i get is not increasing at that rate
5167137 i have to look for money for rent and food i have to supplement my income through the sale of maputi at work
5167138 in the world the top percentile of rich people are millionaires but here beggars on the streets are millionaires
5167139 there is no currency in africa that is measured in millions
5167140 fundamentally the introduction of higher denominated notes is a good step in terms of enhancing convenience
5167141 but it cannot be used as a substitute to tame inflation
5167142 although it is going to be painful we need the pain for future benefits
5167143 as a matter of urgency bags of money would bounce back
5167144 if the authorities refuse to change the currency and assuming these guys will be there in august we wont be able to pronounce our money
5167145 theres a surrealism here thats hard to get across to people
5167146 if you need something and have cash you buy it if you have cash you spend it today because tomorrow its going to be worth 5 percent less

5167149 what if a crook comes to your house with a gun and forces you to open your safe
5167150 ive been involved in coastal research and coastal management in tasmania now for 30 years working both on shore birds and sea birds and in the 30 years that ive been involved in ive seen at a state level average a loss of 50 per cent of the numbers of birds and the mix of birds
5167151 there are birds that i remember seeing in the 80s that i havent seen now for 20 years
5167152 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5167153 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5167154 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5167155 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5167156 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5167157 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5167158 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5167159 its here for us to explore and now theres a guide for everyone to create their own tour of it
5167160 augusta has a rich historical and architectural legacy especially in downtown so this can be used as an educational tool for everyone
5167161 in addition to the educational value i think it will get more people interested in preserving these buildings and sites
5167162 when people come downtown for the tours we hope that they will also go to the restaurants and shop in the stores which will benefit the citys economy
5167163 this is an opportunity for people to take advantage of everything downtown has to offer from its historical sites to its businesses
5167164 to be a boy scout you have to be real outgoing love the outdoors and have leadership skills thats the most important thing
5167165 i know thats going to help me in my adult life
5167166 he took the initiative and none of this would have gotten started without him
5167167 it was a great eagle project and the start of something great for the river
5167168 i had a lot of fun before so i decided to do it
5167169 i wasnt applying myself in school and i really didnt like the high school drama
5167170 i know a lot of people frown on the ged but im confident im going to be successful
5167171 his desire to do something for the whole community is an ideal the boy scouts uphold
5167172 some days it didnt even look like we did much
5167173 people arent as motivated when it feels like 150 degrees outside but we did it
5167174 it was an ambitious thing to do but of course thats my son hes always been ambitious
5167175 this will be another feather in his cap im proud of him i know hell continue to be successful
5167176 to be a boy scout you have to be real outgoing love the outdoors and have leadership skills thats the most important thing i know thats going to help me in my adult life
5167177 almost all of your driving aids are done by local dealers like myself because the prescriptions cant be filled from a distance
5167178 this van is built generically then we turn it into an individuals van
5167179 and then what we have to do is fit the client into this vehicle
5167180 i couldnt hold a job if i couldnt drive back and forth to work
5167181 weve got veterans coming back from iraq and afghanistan that we get to help
5167182 you just cannot put a price on being able to help those guys that is awesome that is very important what we do isnt nearly as important as what theyve done for us
5167183 it has been an effort of the whole parish and the culmination of six or seven years of work
5167184 we have a growing community a committed group of parents and a whole group of parishioners enthusiastic about a grade school everything came together at the right time
5167185 now a whole new group will have christ at the center of all of their classes
5167186 it will help parents raise their children in the faith and it is a statement of hope in the future batavia is a vibrant city and its an opportunity to say that we want to be a part of that
5167187 its been a blessing to be able to meet all the parents
5167188 most painful workout there have been too many to pick one
5167189 im not sure people realize the schedules of these swimmers
5167190 its a tough grind in high school most swimmers practice before school and after school
5167191 if you have multiple kids swimming in a meet one is in the morning session and one swims later
5167192 youre at the meet from 6 a m to 9 p m sometimes but thats just how it is and you deal with it
5167193 every kid is watching swimming right now and thats great
5167194 but i wish broadcasters would talk more about phelps regime people dont have any concept how grueling it is
5167195 but swimming is not an easy sport the older kids swim so many laps it takes a lot of dedication
5167196 all of them tried other sports but they all migrated back to swimming
5167197 they made some of their best friends on swim teams and the sport gave them a great work ethic
5167198 football is something you cant do for the rest of your life
5167199 i plan on not getting any sleep or going to bed before midnight until then
5167200 of course then the beatles happened on ed sullivan and everything changed
5167201 it was almost like you had somebody from your own generation all of a sudden you had a contemporary or a peer
5167202 you go back and you look at the old radio playlists and you had all these different things
5167203 today everything is so narrowcast nobody gets any cross pollination which i think is a huge loss
5167204 all i wanted to do was record myself it never occurred to me i could actually have a real studio
5167205 of course everybody wants to do the record in the basement and come up with a grammy
5167206 but thats not going to happen at least i dont think it is
5167207 utah has the best non bcs talent in the country
5167208 the walls were built with the blood of black people
5167209 desert menu we begin with salmon cerviche followed by saut shrimp on mango and tamarind served with a mango mousse and el mar de juan sea bass marinara
5167210 the andres experience is representative of what the world misses by not going to colombia
5167211 i started with one donut shop added a hamburger place then a diner today i have 22 restaurants a bakery my parents run and the donut factory a chain of 16 donut shops the asked me to develop a chain of coffee shops like starbucks but i could only use 100 colombian coffee unlike starbucks that serves different flavored coffees from around the world to meet this challenge i drew on colombias coffee growing regions with climates that produce a wide variety of coffees with different characteristics
5167212 our idea is to carry exclusive and unusual clothing and accessories to suit all personalities and generations from twenty years to sixty years what you will find here is art to wear
5167213 after he died it helped me mentally and economically i found other women who were needy and set up a cottage industry to transform their lives i now have 24 ladies who are happy and proud my goal is to continue to join my love of painting to make very special one of a kind pieces to sell in the united states
5167214 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5167215 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5167216 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5167217 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5167218 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5167219 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5167220 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5167221 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5167222 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5167223 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5167224 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5167225 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5167226 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5167227 the financial state of the government of guam is bleak

5167229 the only request made to takecare by the commissioner was to discontinue advertising the plan pending review which we did voluntarily one month prior to receipt of the letter
5167230 this person is attacking me because i think x and xe thinks y
5167231 i may just be a small drop in this vast universe but to my loved ones i am their universe
5167232 you mean you saw people running around with guns and shooting each other
5167233 you would certainly hope we have better luck with injuries next season and we need to compliment that with some solid recruiting
5167234 we will be very active during the off season when it comes to recruiting we are already looking at options and having discussions with players
5167235 essendon has had a difficult run with injuries and clearly that flows through and impacts on the side we are able to put on the park
5167236 i would not question the effort of the players we are putting out there but we are short on quality you would like to think you would normally have 10 12 primary listed players out there on the weekend we had just four

5167242 die europ ische digitale bibliothek wird den menschen einen schnellen und einfachen zugang zu europ ischen b chern und kunstwerken bieten

5167250 russians were told over breakfast yesterday what really happened in georgia the conflict in south ossetia was part of a plot by dick cheney the vice president to stop barack obama being elected president of the united states
5167251 modern russia may be plugged into the internet and the global marketplace but in the battle for world opinion the kremlin is replaying the old black and white movie
5167252 the west has spent a lot of time energy and money to teach georgia the tricks of the trade to make the country look like a democracy we and many other nations see through this deceit we understand that the seditious tactics of the so called color revolutions are a real threat to international law and the source of global legal nihilism

5167255 the scientific community is virtually unanimous in calling for a crash program to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and methane the principal greenhouse gases
5167256 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gases is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
5167257 in stark contrast to the oft repeated assertion that the science of climate change is settled significant new peer reviewed research has cast even more doubt on the hypothesis of dangerous human caused global warming
5167258 she can do just about anything or if she doesnt know how to do something she makes sure that she learns how to do it
5167259 she tackles things the ordinary person probably wouldnt that seems to make her happy
5167260 dees an extra special person shes a good listener very focused and a great taskmaster
5167261 they have a very close tight knit family shes always had support from her husband
5167262 when you have the support of your husband to go out and do different things other than the usual its very nice theyre very hardworking people who decide what they want commit to it and follow through
5167263 we didnt have to go the zoo we could have just come here and played with your animals
5167264 my background was not in the restaurant business in fact i didnt care to cook at home
5167265 franchising was very attractive at the time it appealed to an individual who didnt want to reinvent the wheel but wanted to be a part of something that has some proven success
5167266 he included me in the running of that business the interest was always there
5167267 about 25 percent of the restaurants are owned by the corporation thats for research and development purposes
5167268 the other 70 to 75 percent are owned by individuals in the communities where the stores are located
5167269 i could only find one bank that agreed to provide the financing
5167270 that was because of being female and being black and not having any restaurant experience
5167271 if there is a man at all in the back then people think he is the owner and not you
5167272 how many people do you know where all of their children ended up doing something wonderful with their lives three out of three
5167273 my parents had always been entrepreneurs in some way so it didnt strike us as different from other things they had done
5167274 that was a blessing for our family because it kept her from becoming a mother figure
5167275 it was a great two years we did some 9 11 bioterrorism surveillance in new york i worked on the west nile and anthrax outbreaks and a surgical site infection
5167276 if i were going to do it now was the time
5167277 there arent many jobs where you have a built in mentor who loves you
5167278 shes really good with young kids thats probably the hardest job of running a franchise she handles that group really well
5167279 its a hard job you have to do 20 million things at one time
5167280 in general people dont appreciate the intelligence hard work and skill of our employees
5167281 the general perception is this is the last place that you would work
5167282 but the skills that you are exposed to and the training process has given many people their first job
5167283 its been a wonderful experience working with ms crawford i would like to follow in her footsteps one day
5167284 she steered the way for me she let me know what road to take
5167285 makes you believe that you can accomplish anything you put your mind to all youve got to do is claim it and go for it
5167286 shes a super person she taught me everything i know
5167287 i couldnt ask for better i thank god for them everyday
5167288 if they get their ged well pay them for the hours they spend and then we give them a bonus
5167289 most of my hobbies are his hobbies because thats the only way we can spend time together
5167290 she says that shes going to go back and try it again
5167291 shes a lot of fun a lot of things ive done for the first time i did with her and because of her
5167292 that was a life changing experience they live back in the bush
5167293 its been a rewarding experience in many ways the personal growth that it has afforded us has been unbelievable
5167294 its important because we never know when we are going to roll out
5167295 my role as a squad leader is to ensure all the preparations are accomplished so my guys can complete the mission
5167296 it is easier to maneuver with all the protective gear on when soldiers are physically fit
5167297 the team leaders conduct pre combat checks and inspections on personnel and equipment
5167298 we like to sit and laugh and joke to take our minds off of being away from home
5167299 it lightens the soldiers mood before they go on patrol
5167300 our main purpose is to make sure the isf are ready for operations while we sit back in an over watch role
5167301 we facilitate local businesses pursue and detain high value individuals and train nps
5167302 we show them how to conduct the training correctly the first time and then their sergeant takes over teaching them
5167303 until the handoff of operations we are going to be working with the nps every day
5167304 while we are out we make sure they are doing things how we would do them
5167305 we are making sure that when we leave they will have a set of standards to follow
5167306 when we come in from our daily patrol we prepare the trucks for the next days patrol
5167307 the next morning we wake up and check on the trucks again to make sure they are ready to roll
5167308 we cross train all the soldiers on the different weapons systems and communication equipment to give them the experience they need to become team and squad leaders

5167312 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5167313 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5167314 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5167315 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5167316 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5167323 why didnt xyz happen in history or whats its cause
5167324 is problem such that certain percentage of lispers ask these questions or get confused by these
5167325 the time is right for the world of golf to come together for the common good of the sport to reinstate golf as an olympic sport and to the olympic program
5167326 i have no doubt that olympic golf is comfortably the biggest grow the game opportunity that exists to help us bring golf to so many countries where its just starting up
5167327 so the igf is a very strong mandate for supporting its efforts to bring golf to the olympic games
5167328 as you know im a great advocate of golf being part of the program
5167329 i think that having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
5167330 and the reason for that is it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going towards the growth of the game of golf because every country wants to be represented properly in the olympics i believe that every country would now be putting money into the game to get their young players young people young athletes into the sport
5167331 now that golf is going to have this push it means so much to the continental countries where release of funds for a sport will be taken into another dimension if it were an olympic sport
5167332 once a sport is officially accepted into the olympic program it becomes entitled to distribution through their national olympic committees by sport to some of the proceeds of the olympic financial generation
5167333 so i suspect that it would be another way importantly to jump start golf in a lot of countries
5167334 the european tour plays in so many different countries we deal with so many different pgas so many different golf associations and they all feel this will be the single biggest drive to grow the game in their countries
5167335 its been made very clear to us on several occasions by the ioc that if golf is to be in the olympics then it has to be for the top players in the world
5167336 right now i dont have any interest in doing so
5167337 i think our schedule on a global basis is pretty hectic
5167338 i dont think that golf should be an olympic sport at all
5167339 i dont think basketball should be an olympic sport i dont think tennis should be an olympic sport youve got three sports there that guys are getting paid a lot of money to play and compete week in and week out playing those sports and its just so professional and to me thats not what the olympics is about to me the olympics was founded on amateur sports
5167340 so if it was for our amateur golfers i think it would be great for our professional golfers im hesitant
5167341 i want to watch the sports where that is the absolute pinnacle of their career and they had to wait four years for this one moment and they go out and they perform they break a world record win a gold medal and they were able to perform on that spot i think thats a great athletic achievement
5167342 we have to come up with a formula which attracts the leading players of the world also allows players from a wide variety of countries to compete and also recognizes the iocs policy on a limitation on athlete numbers there are a number of possible permutations and thats really one of our big tasks in the coming months is just to decide which format to go with
5167343 certainly its globality the number of countries its played in the number of countries that have an ability to win a medal in the olympics the worldwide commercial appeal of the sport as well as all of the other values integrity that is part of our game match up so well with the olympic ideal
5167344 and where the game is 10 15 20 25 years from now could be fundamentally different because of the step were taking and the short term issues will pale in comparison
5167345 weve got to be able to play some defense but we feel like weve got a couple of good ones on offense
5167346 and we werent all that great on defense last year
5167347 weve just got to figure out ways to get him the football but keep him fresh
5167348 offensively i know well be able to drive the ball but were going to have to make some big plays on defense
5167349 if we can just get it together and play south aiken for the region championship here
5167350 it feels good very good i had two wins last year and two this year so im pretty happy
5167351 before the round i figured i was going to get beat by the youngest and oldest winners in regions cup history
5167352 i played pretty solid today plus i had two eagles
5167353 ive played plenty of bad golf and sometimes played good golf over the years everybodys going to have their day im just another dog having his day
5167354 i dont know who i have to talk to about this
5167355 but im going to make sure he has another birthday sometime during the playoffs
5167356 no pressure at all it was just another baseball game
5167357 im just excited to be back on the field i was pretty relaxed tonight and i saw the ball well
5167358 you run into one of these games and all you can say is im glad im on this end of it
5167359 give a lot of credit to their club at no point did they quit and the manager should be credited for respecting the game like that
5167360 i think its a product of what we have to do
5167361 we cant control that we have to drive to atlanta i think too many people make a big deal about 5 a but we believe in ourselves
5167362 people who want to deny global warming because its easier than dealing with it try to argue that what scientists are really observing is just the urban heat island effect this is simply wrong temperature measurements are generally taken in parks which are actually cool areas within the urban heat islands most scientific research shows that urban heat islands have a negligible effect

5167376 some children particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds do not experience risks in such positive challenging or exciting ways for them risk taking can refer to threats to their safety including the threat of violence
5167377 risk taking can also refer to young people experimenting with drugs and alcohol public parks are sometimes the sites where this activity takes place
5167378 the ambiguity which results from this could lead to misinterpretation and misunderstanding particularly given recent reports and media concerns about cotton wool kids

5167421 the situation was chaotic and horrible i saw dead bodies wounded people and blood stains on the ground later ambulances arrived and picked both the wounded and the dead some shops nearby were damaged
5167422 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself

5167594 most people have a notion that elderly people have very weak immunity or they have lost immunity
5167595 this study shows that extremely elderly people have retained memory of being infected with the 1918 flu even 90 years later
5167596 its important to know that you can develop immunity to such a pandemic virus that has implications for new pandemic viruses
5167597 the elderly might be a very good donor source for finding antibodies against viruses
5167598 this study shows that humans can develop very potent immune responses against dangerous influenza that cause pandemics
5167599 it gives us hope that we can develop vaccines and antibody treatments for any other pandemic viruses that come along
5167600 the implication of this study is the 1918 virus was so powerful that the immunity you had to have in order to survive was so prominent that it lasted for the rest of your life
5167601 so those in certain age groups who had seen a related virus had the strongest responses
5167602 either they died or they developed a profound immune response

5167608 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5167609 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5167610 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5167611 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5167617 i would argue that if you are making more than 250 000 then you are in the top 3 4 percent of this country
5167618 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
5167619 to be fair to both of them rich is an adjective
5167620 economic science is not going to tell you that this is the cutoff point
5167621 if you set the bar at half a million youre talking about the top 1 of taxpayers if you think about the last eight years those are the folks who have benefited the most
5167622 give me a specific number is it 100 000 dollars is it 50 200
5167623 if you do surveys 95 of people think they are middle class
5167624 this is including people who are objectively quite poor and people who are objectively quite rich
5167625 i guess it says something nice about america that rich people dont want to act like theyre better than anybody else and poor people dont like complaining about how tough it is to pay their bills
5167626 it should come as no surprise that john mccain believes the cutoff for the rich begins at 5 million
5167627 it may explain why his tax plan gives a 600 000 tax cut to the richest 0 1 of earners

5167658 it recognised that while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on march 29 2008
5167659 the negotiating parties are convening and will look at whatever matters might be outstanding the sadc organ did not give a cut off date
5167660 lets really allow the people of zimbabwe to determine their future any solution thats imposed from outside wont last it wont last unless its a common product that is owned by the entire collective of the leadership of zimbabwe
5167661 failure is not an option it is critical that we continue this dialogue
5167662 we will need to resuscitate that shared vision and commitment the unity and cohesion that have characterised sadc from its inception as we consider the next steps to advance our regional integration efforts in southern africa
5167663 we need to ensure that all members are able to jointly meet that milestone

5167665 no one likes to be perceived or seen as being arrogant and i dont like that i dont like it and i admit its a problem for me
5167666 if i get asked a question i normally give a straight answer and some people perceive that as arrogance
5167667 thats the way i approach things i try to answer everything truthfully i try to answer everything as directly as i possibly can i call things as i see them
5167668 some people see that as arrogance i admit that and it is a problem for us and it is something i have to work on
5167669 when i found out jade was going on big brother india i was as shocked as when i first met her why go through this again
5167670 but part of me was really happy because it is an opportunity to show how welcoming we are
5167671 shes going in as someone who has had misconceptions about our country i hope jade learns first hand about our culture and how wonderful our people are

5167674 two of these things zipped past me yesterday on saint viateur
5167675 two pembroke teenagers have been charged in connection with a series of playing cards that were defaced with threatening writing and left at stores in christiansburg and pearisburg a gesture police said the teens admitted had been inspired by this summers batman movie
5167676 we the minutemen below respectfully demand a 3 hour running time for the forthcoming movie watchmen from warner bros directed by zack snyder 300 dawn of the dead watchmen is a film adaptation of what is widely regarded by comic fans as the greatest superhero story ever as with any movie warner bros have a responsibility to make watchmen a commercial success and to appeal to a broad audience many of whom will not be familiar with the story and therein lies the issue while discussions with wb studio executives are ongoing about the running time of the movie there is pressure to ensure that it comes in at below 2hrs and 50 minutes we the minutemen below submit that watchmen must be a 3 hour movie and ask wb to respect and extend the courtesy of this longer running time to the giant of all superhero stories
5167677 if the atoms never swerve so as to originate some new movement that will snap the bonds of fate the everlasting sequence of cause and effect what is the source of the free will possessed by living things throughout the earth
5167678 the president will address the nation at 1 00pm 0700 gmt
5167679 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall
5167680 he has seen the sentiments of not just the elected representatives but various institutions who all asked him to move in a particular way and do not destabilise things here
5167681 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter
5167682 i think during my lifetime i will see the reunification of the two koreas
5167683 it can happen any day and it can happen suddenly we must be very much prepared for that
5167684 more than anyone else i have deep deep affection for the people in north korea they are our brothers and sisters i dont want to engage in any political showmanship i want actual and genuine dialogue towards mutual benefit and co existence on the peninsula
5167685 we must maintain thorough preparations as there is always the possibility of a limited conflict with north korea
5167686 steadily attempt to promote an ideological rift in south korea we should be fully prepared for that
5167687 the us really stands for these things that is freedom democracy and also free trade so for any us administration and president to be less enthusiastic about a free trade agreement with any particular country i think that goes against what the us stands for
5167688 the fta not only benefits south korea but also has huge potential benefits for the us economy and consumers whoever becomes the next us president will look at the hard facts and make the right decision in the interest of the us people
5167689 we knew that we needed to win this race and more in order to close down valentinos advantage so this makes the championship very difficult for us
5167690 anything can happen in racing but 50 points is a big gap against such a strong and consistent competitor
5167691 anyway i never throw in the towel nor does anybody at ducati and we will keep fighting until the end
5167692 misano is a home race for the factory and there will be lots of ducatisti there so my main thought now is to stay positive and bounce back with a good show for them in two weeks time
5167693 obviously we are all disappointed with this result because our pace in practice was good everything went very well this morning and we felt we could push out in front
5167694 i was doing the same lap time over and over and i was quite happy with the pace i was running
5167695 the crash came out of the blue that corner was an easy one but i lost the front and it happened very quickly very suddenly and i didnt manage to save it
5167696 its a hard one to explain and we will look at the data but sometimes this kind of crash happens at this level of racing and it was my mistake
5167697 id carefully prepared for a difficult duel with stoner which the first laps of the race confirmed
5167698 but i have to say as well that my motorcycle was running perfectly and allowed me to ride very calmly towards victory
5167699 lius injury has been diagnosed as something wrong with his hamstring but not with the bone
5167700 it is an accumulated injury due to long training and it will affect him if he uses power
5167701 it wont cause problems for the heats but im worried about the semi finals and the final
5167702 the march of the volunteers chinas national anthem is ringing out in every stadium
5167703 chinese lag behind in track and field despite all the efforts we have made to improve it is still a long way to go before we catch up with the world level
5167704 with events like track and field chinas pace in winning gold medals will slow down
5167705 the guidelines are designed to minimise the use of animals in scientific research through focusing on the three rs the replacement of animal research with other types of research when possible reduction of the number of animals used in research and refinement of research techniques to minimise pain and distress
5167706 when it is necessary to study animals in medical research all involved have an obligation to care for the animals in the best ways possible
5167707 but the issue remains though that while we have these great documents there is still no compulsory training for new and existing researchers on the laws and the best ways to reduce pain and distress
5167708 and they are not trained in the many excellent alternatives like computer modelling for example that can do just as good a job in testing without involving animals
5167709 at the moment there is a feeling there is far too much animal testing going on because of a lack of knowledge in many quarters and unfortunately a document while encouraging is not going to change that
5167710 the president will address the nation at 1pm 17 00 aest
5167711 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall
5167712 he has seen the sentiments of not just the elected representatives but various institutions who all asked him to move in a particular way and do not destabilise things here
5167713 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter
5167714 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5167715 most of what you see is his input along with mine he has gone into the detail he has been part of it and comes here to look at things
5167716 if the foundation of the american polity was laid by the federalists the anti federalist reservations echo through american history and it is in the dialogue not merely in the federalist victory that the countrys principles are to be discovered

5167734 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5167735 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5167736 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5167737 the two heads of state have agreed on the establishment of diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level and have discussed various topics including the demarcation of the joint border in the course of the meetings that took place during this visit which constitutes the highest level of contact between the two countries since 2005

5167742 we are waiting for them to come back with the law in english
5167743 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5167744 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission

5167749 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5167750 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5167751 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5167752 die zahl der kioske in deutschland wird sinken wir bekommen eine konsolidierung
5167753 gef hrdet sind vor allem jene gesch fte die weiterhin nur altbew hrte sortimente wie zigaretten anbieten an denen es nicht viel zu verdienen gibt die betreiber die auf den convenience zug aufspringen die mehr kleine mahlzeiten tiefk hlpizzen und frische produkte anbieten haben eine gute berlebenschance
5167754 eine gute bude nicht an irgendwelchem schnickschnack sondern an der werbung f r eine lokale biersorte einem schild von langnese eis und einem handgeschriebenen schildchen hier klingeln
5167755 sie brauchen die langen ffnungszeiten um berhaupt den notwendigen tagesumsatz hereinzubekommen wenn man sich die produktivit t und den stundenlohn ausrechnen w rde m sste man wohl die meisten kioske schlie en
5167756 die meisten kioske funktionieren nur weil die ganze familie mitmacht m ssten die betreiber mitarbeiter bezahlen w rden sie keinen cent verdienen

5167758 wenn die bei mir am spielautomaten nicht rauchen d rfen kommen die kein zweites mal
5167759 die b dchen konnten aber davon profitieren dass die bundesweiten handelsketten in den vergangenen jahren viele kleine superm rkte in den wohngebieten geschlossen haben in diesen f llen bernahmen die kioske einen teil der aufgabe als nahversorger gerade f r ltere leute
5167760 bei einer durchschnittsmarge von 30 prozent bleiben 60 000 euro brig davon muss der betreiber aber noch miete energie und schlimmstenfalls personal bezahlen

5167772 the ayrshire extra is a popular and well respected newspaper which has been recognised for its work on behalf of the local community

5167774 the results at leeds town hall were pretty conclusive as the episode shows
5167775 we had all kinds of activity which proves to my mind that spirits are all around us
5167776 the cells were a fantastic location filled with a real sense of atmosphere and being completely honest a horrible feeling of foreboding
5167777 as viewers will see we ended up with much more than we bargained for
5167778 this is a real first for the yorkshire evening post
5167779 this is a fully fledged series of programmes that we hope will prove to be truly groundbreaking for our website
5167780 these buildings are iconic and we were lucky enough to be given unprecedented access to parts the public never gets to see
5167781 this series represents the opportunities the web has given newspapers like ours
5167782 with this series were hopefully going to show what can be achieved by pushing our own relatively modest understanding of video to its limit
5167783 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5167784 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5167785 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5167786 a 110 meter hurdles race without liu is such a pity
5167787 but they will understand when somebody has an accident you cant help it
5167788 the situation was getting pretty serious and i knew that the weather was getting worse and i was starting to have to really plan ahead for something dramatic
5167789 i just knew that i had to try and survive to help them out
5167790 i tried to make the right decisions and luckily we got out
5167791 there were a couple of moments where i had to lead them up quite a dangerous avalanche slope and i told them to hang on and when i went up i set an avalanche off and i really feared for their lives but we just had to continue on and try
5167792 literally we were digging ourselves in a hole deeper and deeper and getting buried more and more
5167793 i just wanted to try and jot down some of my thoughts and what was happening because i didnt know if wed get out of it and i just wanted to write a record down when i was still sane because in such cold conditions your body starts deteriorating quite quickly
5167794 they the us have been issuing statements saying they want fiji to return to democratic rule the us has also increased investment in its military base in guam
5167795 globally the big concern is that the region is not on track to meet its development goals and thats despite economic growth and lots of aid from australia new zealand and the us
5167796 these countries are the highest per capita receivers of aid anywhere in the world but there are still law and order and corruption problems in papua new guinea and the solomon islands the economy is still too reliant on australia and aid it is the fragility of some of these nations that is in question some of them could revert

5167802 this is a prime example of how able forensic investigations is concerend with its responsibility to provifde a pubilc service to the cumminity and specifically allow a professional service to those who may normally not be in a position to retain a private criminal defense investigtor
5167803 in this case our backrgound and success within the field of criminal defense investigations as well as our reputation within the community has allowed us the ability to offer this service
5167804 we also conduct surveillance activities historical and transactional research perform forensic accounting analysis collecti and review evidence prepare thorough accurate and professionally written investigative reports as well as presenting expert testimony

5167812 people are afraid to leave their house after 7 p m
5167813 i am still a student but this was an order from the commander of the academy that we should come out and search the vehicles
5167814 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me and without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas ill never forget that no matter where you are no matter how difficult the circumstances there will always be someone who will pick you up
5167815 i wouldnt expect a resolution any time soon but we will get these guys we will hunt them down
5167816 we may get a few extra false alarms i dont have a problem processing those
5167817 the remoteness probably helps the criminals i would think somebody could stash a car make their way through the woods and after the robbery easily get away without being detected
5167818 if you do your homework you figure out how to stash the car and go through the woods who is going to find you on foot
5167819 you dont have a good escape path many of the roads in barrington hills are dead end streets if someone becomes aware of your presence you have no way out
5167820 chris puts forth nothing less than extraordinary performance and devotion on and off duty
5167821 well have to take a taxi down to the public transport system and those cost
5167822 i would like to walk and i feel in need of it
5167823 we dont have a lot of choice anyway there isnt a vehicle in sight theyre all driving people up at this time of day with the elevators out this place is falling apart
5167824 i did watch it its gruesome and if you play with it itll grew some more hello lani big piece of beefcake you got yourself
5167825 hello dee so this is where you got to after school
5167826 its a dirty job but someone has to do it and the pays good even if it doesnt have the glamour of the force
5167827 besides you never could fight your way out of a brown paper bag
5167828 hey leave him alone hes mine besides he doesnt like it see
5167829 hes yours entirely not just trial wow bid sealed the lot
5167830 stop it youre making him cringe and hes all mine you havent gotten any less coarse have you dee youve got a mind like a sewer
5167831 nope just as coarse not much else to think about on the job except fried electronics and sex is more fun
5167832 search me its none of the electronics modules weve tried pulling and replacing all of them in case it was something that wasnt showing up on the tell tales we had a job getting out the people who were stuck ill tell you took about four hours and the car stinks like hell it stuck just here where the control module is too so we have to work with the pong in the background at least all the others came to a stop at the nearest floor
5167833 lovely bouquet in there mind you ill just take him in there for a little while lani you have a nice rest
5167834 holy susan you never give up do you put another hand on him and ill take it off at the wrist you maneater
5167835 that stuff is tough big boy its the electronics that doesnt last forever oh
5167836 you could just be right beefcake heh and weve spent days testing the electronics i reckon i could just get a bonus out of you two
5167837 well i think you owe us a ride down in the cargo elevator if thats still working
5167838 tch hes big enough for both of us arent you big boy
5167839 its just shocking i cant believe it all these years you have these copper gutters here and come to work one day and theyre gone
5167840 the price of copper has gone up and theyre police assuming thats why
5167841 explained anne carlino building supervisor for the libertyville civic center foundation which operates the building
5167842 somebody had to get up in a very difficult spot to get that gutter off
5167843 we see reports of thieves just taking copper wire off the utility poles
5167844 typically when we see the economy gets a little more tight if theres a profit to be made somebody is going to do it
5167845 unfortunately there is a market for stolen copper and things of that nature
5167846 its going to cost a lot more than that to fix the building
5167847 if we want to maintain our historic status the expectation is we replace them as they originally were on the building
5167848 something like this happening really points out this building is an important structure and its costly when something is taken
5167849 skipper weve got an unscheduled hyper footprint at six million kilometers
5167850 its a single footprint maam very small probably a dispatch boat
5167851 i have a communications request i think youd better take
5167852 but youre going to have to do a bit better than that captain brangeard was it there are proper channels for diplomatic exchanges ones that dont let havenite dispatch boats into sensor range of sensitive installations so i recommend you try a bit harder to convince me not to open fire
5167853 lets see if i cant just do that little thing for the captain
5167854 but i have a message for her majesty from the president of the republic of haven
5167855 weve been talking about mark spitz for 36 years now
5167856 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5167857 being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when i was tired and i didnt want to be there
5167858 im just thankful for him having done what he did
5167859 the sport of swimming has come a long way so far and i think it can go even further
5167860 mike is opening a lot of doors with what hes doing
5167861 coach bob bowman has a saying putting money in the bank
5167862 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank
5167863 i guess i put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years and we withdrew pretty much every penny in the bank after bob and i both grab a little break itll be time to start depositing
5167864 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5167865 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5167866 if i go out in public the military will be more than happy to walk with me and tell me to get my butt back to the hotel
5167867 its a little weird when people walk past you and they scream and start crying
5167868 weve all had some experience with that kobe most of all
5167869 fans are passionate we have security with us at the same time were not untouchable we can move around and shake hands
5167870 weve had fun when weve been out but its not regular
5167871 we go to the village and i look up and theyre nowhere to be found while im standing in the middle of a crowd of people
5167872 i like his 3 point shots two points is ok too
5167873 he has experience and he also plays consistently especially in the crucial moments
5167874 ive been out here several times and the support has always been great but this has been another level
5167875 i dont know how this happened or when this happened
5167876 chicago when it came down to kyle and jimmie and jimmie lost it on the restart i didnt want to have to go through that pain so i just did everything i could to have the best restart i could and it worked out great
5167877 i cant believe my good fortune ive been in the presence of really fast company
5167878 except for kyle busch finishing up there we had a chance to have two or three winners actually four winners out of the top five
5167879 kyle is just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us due to bonus points
5167880 so thats what we just have to keep doing is go out here and try to win the next three events and go into the chase on even ground
5167881 he is always strong hes been the guy that weve got to race on these mile and a half and two mile race tracks
5167882 hes been decent at other race tracks too but not as stout as he is at these and there are a lot of these in the chase
5167883 he took a giant gamble on me i felt at the time to put me in that car
5167884 jack won the race that day i believe greg biffle won it and we finished 10th and all five cars were in the top 10
5167885 to be a part of that again today for ford motor co for roush and for all the guys its an honor
5167886 thats going to have a lot of bearing on how we finish this year
5167887 the line has a lot to do with that running game too
5167888 it gives us an opportunity to prove ourselves hopefully those teams will be doing well when we face them
5167889 that way well be able to show the nation what we can do
5167890 our thoughts and prayers are with the students who were injured and their families as well as chris and his family
5167891 were here its the olympic games its time for a showdown a throwdown
5167892 i thought i was going to be able to run a little bit slower
5167893 i did what i had to do and make it through
5167894 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5167895 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5167896 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5167897 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5167898 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5167899 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5167900 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5167901 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5167902 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5167903 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5167904 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again
5167905 i am optimistic about the bilateral talk with the thai side to seek peaceful resolution to withdraw the troops totally from the keo sikha kiri svara pagoda and the surrounding areas of the preah vihear temple in the eponymous cambodian province
5167906 we want to withdraw all the troops from the areas near the preah vihear temple clear the mines there and finally plant border demarcation posts between the two countries
5167907 we will discuss step by step to withdraw the troops there and end the problem in the near future
5167908 if voices like mine are not heard in new delhi i will have no option but to resign from parliament
5167909 mainstream leaders should resign from the parliament and support the separatist movement
5167910 a t il d clar lors de son allocution t l vis e hebdomadaire
5167911 can china still be considered a developing country or can we say it has developed
5167912 were excited we managed to get these dates scheduled so we can celebrate the release of our first ever live dvd by playing an extra long set for all of our diehards this tour will hit a bunch of cities we werent able to hit on the jager run so be ready to rage we also plan on doing some special signings so stay tuned for more info these will be our last shows until stillborn fest 08 so dont miss out
5167913 the hardest thing at the olympics in the high jump is just getting to the finals once youre in the finals youre carefree you dont have to worry about anything
5167914 my clearance at 7 4 1 2 wasnt that great i knew i needed to give a lot more at 7 6 i definitely put forth the effort it just wasnt good enough
5167915 there has been just so much support from my family and friends especially back in raleigh
5167916 itll be hard to go home and face everyone i let myself down i know i didnt let all of them down because i made it to beijing but i really expected to do a lot better you put so much effort in one meet so when you dont do well it really hurts it stinks
5167917 i shot a great match its just a crazy thing that happens
5167918 just worrying about calming myself down and just breaking a good shot and so i didnt even look at the number
5167919 the way i come into a target is i start above the target and come down from 12 oclock and get into the
5167920 and as i get down into the is when i start to get on the trigger
5167921 as i was starting to get on the trigger the gun just went off
5167922 i was like uh thats not going to be good
5167923 hearing the spectators cheering i felt maybe i got the silver but my coach told me i got the gold
5167924 i said that last time and its the truth maybe last time the reason was katy this time i dont know yet but im sure something goods going to come from it
5167925 when hes been at the top with a chance he usually wins
5167926 i felt i was letting the tournament slip away at 10 and 11 with bogeys
5167927 i made a nice positive stroke at 12 and that was the turning point
5167928 something just clicked every time i saw him it was just michael when erik got hurt and theyd show him on the jumbotron my seatmates would look over at me and id be crying
5167929 i went ballistic i never had words like that come out of my mouth really bad words
5167930 i still love the hockey team but i think jim rutherford has made a big mistake
5167931 i cant support that i may be one out of thousands but thats just who i am
5167932 of course when youre training your whole life to get to the olympics you train for gold
5167933 but honestly a silver around my neck three times at the olympics means more to me than anything
5167934 i am not as excited as i was when i won the mens team gold medal
5167935 because we finally released the pressure that had built up for so many years
5167936 to make it here and make a mistake is hard but she did a great job no matter what shes one of the most respected gymnasts out there
5167937 i knew izbasa had beaten me in prelims so i was a little more nervous
5167938 i had a little bit of hope inside me but seeing how beautifully she did her routine i knew
5167939 ill never be able to get that out of my head i guess you learn to move on and its something you have to live with
5167940 i remember him getting into the car and saying god wants me to go to michigan
5167941 his fathers dream was to watch him play college football and so the first time he comes out of the michigan stadium tunnel and the first hit he takes its going to have a different meaning than it would have
5167942 i dont think its so much that hes putting up a brave front i think hes a brave person i think hes a courageous person and i think hes a faith filled person
5167943 i think that if there is a dc exploit and people are using it ea should just clear the leader boards and get rid of the ranks if they can do that after released problem fixed
5167944 the top issue at the sydney summit is data security
5167945 it is a necessary part of a security program and is big because it reveals the limitations of a purely technological approach to security
5167946 there hasnt been that much data loss happening here in australia but being a security person i assume that these terrible things are happening but nobody talks about them
5167947 its become a big phrase but weve been talking about computing in the cloud for 15 years
5167948 theres still a big debate about what it exactly means i tend to want to specify aspects of cloud computing for example software as a service is an example of a cloud computing
5167949 i get a little tired of the marketing fight over who owns the concept lets get on with the business of security and not worry too much
5167950 i think they had some good moments and some not so good moments
5167951 the witnesses said it appeared they were familiar with the weapon that maybe they had handled it before
5167952 some of these things come back right away and theyre ready to go
5167953 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5167954 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5167955 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5167956 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play
5167957 ive been in magdeburg since the middle of last winter im just back for a month or so now for a fire prevention training conference
5167958 start with this the fire marshall of our wonderful united states of europe is that prick from baltimore archie stannard one of the masaniellos relatives who got caught in the ring of fire because of vince and carlas fortieth anniversary party over at pray your rosary catholic church or whatever theyre calling it these days
5167959 from the minute the grantville fire department chief steve matheny picked him up as assistant chief stannards been trying to make us more professional sometimes i thought that if i heard the word professional one more time i would gag steve kept us right up to the mark on equipment and training but he didnt preach about it stannard does i guess i could have lived with that though since the ring of fire wed all been on call 24 7 and that wears you out so i sort of put it down to stress but then in the fall of 32 stearns made this agreement with whats his name the captain general you know and stannard started on this kick of expanding modern fire prevention into the rest of the new united states its one thing to work your ass off for grantville its something else when they expect you to do it for a bunch of foreigners
5167960 you didnt have anyone in magdeburg back then did you
5167961 no but they sent me over to rudolstadt right off the bat as soon as steve insisted that he needed me to go full time rather than volunteer which i agreed to do even though with overtime i was sure making more at ollies than the government pays us the count over there speaks some english at least even though he sounds like one of those shakespeare plays that lisa dailey tried to make us read in high school
5167962 shakespeares not so bad we even read some of his stuff back in my day and he sounded a lot like the king james version which the reverends jones never should have gotten rid of and put in one of these so called modern translations of the bible
5167963 im not even at the navy yard which might make some sense
5167964 i never heard anyone complain that bibi couldnt handle it shes a big woman
5167965 at least her boys are grown and sara stayed back here in grantville with dean and his new wife so shes not distracted by having to find child care and schools ill give her that much
5167966 deans new wife would you believe that her name is krapp
5167967 you cant believe how many decent americans are marrying these kraut whores there must be a half dozen or so who are actually taking classes at that kraut church out on what used to be route 250 on the way to rudolstadt so they can marry them in kraut ceremonies and it wont be any too soon for ryan baker and his girlfriend if you know what i mean believe me little slut she works in cora ennis kitchen at the cafe
5167968 i can see that its getting to be a problem hell veda mae have you heard what lenores dad did
5167969 wes not a word not since he and the other people we sent over to fulda were kidnapped by a bunch of ungrateful krauts that was in the paper a while back i dont have time to read the papers much though
5167970 well the rest of our people over there got them back including wes anyway he celebrated his delivery from the dungeon or wherever he was by marrying a kraut woman himself sister of that dietrich bachmeier from badenburg whos a sort of cousin of the guy whos birdie newhouses partner these days that farmer up at sundremda same last name
5167971 hey keep us out of this the dungeons and dragons guy is royally creeping us out
5167972 conforme al decreto el estado de excepci n se mantendr vigente de las 21 00 horas locales 17 00 gmt del 17 de agosto hasta las 21 00 horas locales del 17 de septiembre

5167975 sigo las pol ticas econ micas en las ltimas d cadas y por primera vez tenemos avances equilibrados en el plano econ mico y social lo cual es extremadamente positivo y poderoso pero nuestro punto de partida es tr gico seguimos teniendo una concentraci n de la renta simplemente indecente indecorosa comparada con otros pa ses seguimos teniendo un fuerte desnivel de remuneraci n entre hombres y mujeres de renta entre regiones pobres y ricas en brasil m s all la direcci n en que estamos avanzando es muy positiva y es importante hacer presi n para que se avance cada vez m s pero tenemos que tener conciencia del atraso hist rico que el pa s acumul en el plano social
5167976 this is an issue that is not on the table
5167977 everyone knows that we disagreed with his decision in terms of the state of emergency that he declared but he was he kept to his word he took off the uniform theres now a democratic government in pakistan
5167978 when al qaeda was in afghanistan they had the partnership of a government they had ready access to international communications ready access to travel
5167979 i spoke to the people in york this morning and they have had plenty of rain as well the ground is heavy and well just have to see how duke of marmalade which would prefer it better gets on at this stage hes not a defiite runner
5167980 if you dream your biggest dream anything is possible no matter what you set your imagination to anything can happen
5167981 our quarterly economic forecast highlights a significant worsening in uk economic prospects
5167982 i found the movie a good one it had great battle scenes the effects were great one of the best ive seen since the last star wars movie the actors we
5167983 you can phrase it a lot of different ways but we just have to get better up front
5167984 if you dont have a good offensive line you just aint going to be very good period
5167985 their rear end needs to be kicked out of there theyre shiftless they nascar just need to do something
5167986 im surprised they got caught when people get an advantage they dont want to give it up and sometimes they go to extremes to keep from giving up an advantage and thats just what they did
5167987 its a loop thats unaffordable i cant afford to do a new engine for nationwide right now
5167988 nascar can establish parity with the tests that theyve done or they can leave it be
5167989 if they leave it alone they will establish not only the truck series but also the nationwide series as a single manufacturers bastion
5167990 i want to apologize to nascar our partners the toyota guys a couple guys made a decision there that impacted all of us to me the big question is why
5167991 i know they were frustrated and wanted to make it look like were handicapped on horsepower even more than we were i understand that but that is not an excuse
5167992 full responsibility and any penalties nascar levies against us it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5167993 to have your number retired its one of the greatest things that could ever happen to you
5167994 i knew the significance of it so i was nervous i havent been this nervous in a long time
5167995 implementing a cooperation with china aimed at promoting clean coal technologies
5167996 our storyline today is that of a city in the pink of health
5167997 it was not easy the pain will never go away
5167998 we are set to honor the new class of workers who are competent confident and courteous and caring who consistently demonstrate first rate public service as a way of life
5167999 the benefits that will accrue to this town and the whole district as well and the province as a whole in terms of taxes investments and employment opportunities are tremendous

5168013 the rupee is tracking the weakness in other asian currencies and even in the offshore the dollar was quite high on friday so that also led to some dollar buying in the morning
5168014 the rupee may fall towards 43 50 if it breaks 43 30 in a major way but state run banks are likely to sell dollars to hold it above that level
5168015 here are the positions we are in the process of filling
5168016 ok that felt like you were making it up as you went
5168017 is there anything youd care go back lead yourself into
5168018 were going to fox trot and its going to be silver
5168019 der schiedsrichter wollte hier unbedingt im mittelpunkt stehen er hat unserem team zwei punkte geklaut
5168020 mit den beiden punkten h tten wir den zweiten satz gewonnen und im entscheidenden dritten satz h tten wir sehr gute chancen auf den sieg gehabt
5168021 es ist einfach schade dass ein schiedsrichter bei so einem wichtigen spiel nicht in der lage ist ein wenig fingerspitzengef hl zu zeigen wir waren unserer meinung nach im recht und dann gleich einen punktabzug hinnehmen zu m ssen das ist nat rlich bitter

5168068 it is troubling that there are so many countries that appear not to record the lives of those animals suffering in their laboratories
5168069 knowing the number of animals used gives real ammunition for the general public to put pressure on their governments to play their part in the global reduction and replacement of animals in experiments
5168070 the paper makes too many assumptions and extrapolations to have any confidence in its conclusion
5168071 they know the media will pick up 115 million as the top line result and not delve deeper into how they achieved this number
5168072 this year is the first time in 16 years that we have seen the number of animals used in uk labs exceed three million
5168073 the human genome project threw up many new genes but we dont know what their functions are
5168074 the reintroduction of turkey oak and the re invasion of gall wasps into northern europe may simply represent restoration of a previous natural situation
5168075 no one likes to be perceived or seen as being arrogant and i dont like that i dont like it and i admit its a problem for me
5168076 if i get asked a question i normally give a straight answer and some people perceive that as arrogance
5168077 thats the way i approach things i try to answer everything truthfully i try to answer everything as directly as i possibly can i call things as i see them
5168078 some people see that as arrogance i admit that and it is a problem for us and it is something i have to work on
5168079 we knew that we needed to win this race and more in order to close down valentinos advantage so this makes the championship very difficult for us
5168080 anything can happen in racing but 50 points is a big gap against such a strong and consistent competitor
5168081 anyway i never throw in the towel nor does anybody at ducati and we will keep fighting until the end
5168082 misano is a home race for the factory and there will be lots of ducatisti there so my main thought now is to stay positive and bounce back with a good show for them in two weeks time
5168083 obviously we are all disappointed with this result because our pace in practice was good everything went very well this morning and we felt we could push out in front
5168084 i was doing the same lap time over and over and i was quite happy with the pace i was running
5168085 the crash came out of the blue that corner was an easy one but i lost the front and it happened very quickly very suddenly and i didnt manage to save it
5168086 its a hard one to explain and we will look at the data but sometimes this kind of crash happens at this level of racing and it was my mistake
5168087 id carefully prepared for a difficult duel with stoner which the first laps of the race confirmed
5168088 but i have to say as well that my motorcycle was running perfectly and allowed me to ride very calmly towards victory
5168089 i think during my lifetime i will see the reunification of the two koreas
5168090 it can happen any day and it can happen suddenly we must be very much prepared for that
5168091 more than anyone else i have deep deep affection for the people in north korea they are our brothers and sisters i dont want to engage in any political showmanship i want actual and genuine dialogue towards mutual benefit and co existence on the peninsula
5168092 we must maintain thorough preparations as there is always the possibility of a limited conflict with north korea
5168093 steadily attempt to promote an ideological rift in south korea we should be fully prepared for that
5168094 the us really stands for these things that is freedom democracy and also free trade so for any us administration and president to be less enthusiastic about a free trade agreement with any particular country i think that goes against what the us stands for
5168095 the fta not only benefits south korea but also has huge potential benefits for the us economy and consumers whoever becomes the next us president will look at the hard facts and make the right decision in the interest of the us people
5168096 the guidelines are designed to minimise the use of animals in scientific research through focusing on the three rs the replacement of animal research with other types of research when possible reduction of the number of animals used in research and refinement of research techniques to minimise pain and distress
5168097 when it is necessary to study animals in medical research all involved have an obligation to care for the animals in the best ways possible
5168098 but the issue remains though that while we have these great documents there is still no compulsory training for new and existing researchers on the laws and the best ways to reduce pain and distress
5168099 and they are not trained in the many excellent alternatives like computer modelling for example that can do just as good a job in testing without involving animals
5168100 at the moment there is a feeling there is far too much animal testing going on because of a lack of knowledge in many quarters and unfortunately a document while encouraging is not going to change that
5168101 the president will address the nation at 1 00pm 0700 gmt
5168102 he is a wise man he is a very experienced man and he has seen the writing on the wall

5168104 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter

5168108 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter

5168113 the march of the volunteers chinas national anthem is ringing out in every stadium
5168114 chinese lag behind in track and field despite all the efforts we have made to improve it is still a long way to go before we catch up with the world level
5168115 with events like track and field chinas pace in winning gold medals will slow down
5168116 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed the 40gb ps3 is 50 more than an xbox 360 elite 250 and comes with a decent blu ray player too assuming the 80gb ps3 replaces the 40gb amp 60gb models when it comes to the uk probably this fall and with the dualshock 3 controller too how is this bad value just about every retailer will throw a game in with that cost too there is no difference of blu ray to standard dvd unless your screen size is 60
5168117 my immediate reaction to being on the ground i cant believe the difference between what ive learned in graduate school and what im currently seeing here ive learned more from the researchers government officials law enforcement and ngo officials in the last week than i did in my last year of academic research in my academic reading i learned we tend to victimize trafficking survivors while here in thailand ive learned why that is so off base and potentially damaging in my readings i learned about the importance of cross cultural communication in global development efforts while here ive learned why it is crucial and how delicately communications must be handled this program exposed us students to entirely different frameworks of understanding the international sex and labor trades speakers topics ranged from a variety of backgrounds and vantage points and occasionally discussion points contradicted each other the discussions made me more aware of the diversity of factors for which i must account in my future anti trafficking efforts i am now more aware of a broader and globalized spectrum of exploitation the combination of economic and structural factors perpetuating exploitation and human traffickings position within the spectrum i can better recognize the need for a holistic community development approach addressing human traffickings root causes

5168141 team sports like cricket should not be included in the olympics olympics is a personal game where sportsman tries to excel within himself

5168153 i wonder will i find bliss if i commit wholeheartedly to her lifestyle suggestions
5168154 i didnt think it was possible for her to do it or anyone to do it for an entire year
5168155 if she merely says mary j bliges cds are in stores today i dont buy it
5168156 with some of the things like the clothes in the beginning i was like how dare she tell me what to wear
5168157 but recently when i went shopping with my mom i was really excited to fulfill some of the rules i felt kind of proud of myself it takes a huge amount of pressure off to be handed a spiritual path
5168158 im kind of embarrassed to admit but i can understand why people want it to be that way
5168159 oprah says you must savor every meal so now i eat more slowly
5168160 its about what it really feels like to take oprahs word as gospel and about what robyn learns from this
5168161 i think they want her personal help because they think she has the secret
5168162 she has a private plane and she came from nothing if shes lifted herself up from the horrible background she came from shes got the key when she gives advice its sort of like doling out some of that
5168163 oprahs like the popular girl in high school who knows how to emotionally blackmail us
5168164 the way shell deliver advice is this will make you happy unless you dont have enough self esteem to do it
5168165 a frustration we all feel with oprah over the years
5168166 at the same time that she is one of the richest people in the world
5168167 when oprah really lived by her advice and i think that time was 1988
5168168 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
5168169 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
5168170 they both conducted drives that scored which i thought was important
5168171 on the surface i would say they both played well the best thing about it today is to win on the road
5168172 just to manage the game to see things to get comfortable in the pocket again all those things i felt very good for the limited action i got its always fun when you get out there
5168173 you always want to try to get a drive going and we stumbled a little bit
5168174 we couldnt make some plays myself included i wanted to get a good drive in and we did in the second half a nice long drive converted on third down and got a touchdown
5168175 it was good to come out two weeks in a row and get a sustained drive and some third down conversions
5168176 but we want touchdowns we dont want field goals weve got to eliminate the three and outs
5168177 the first play we knew they were going to go deep on him hes a competitive guy it wasnt too big for him
5168178 i felt pretty comfortable out there i think overall i had a decent game
5168179 tim every time hes gotten an opportunity has shown to be a pretty strong runner
5168180 i think hes got a good knack around the goal line of finding a way to get the ball in
5168181 there was a feeling that there should be a single trophy for the plate and elite divisions we also thought of reducing the number of elite teams from 15 to 10 but decided to defer a decision on the issue
5168182 knowing the difference between what you have a right to do and what is the right thing to do
5168183 just the emergence of the efforts are a signal that the political will that seemed totally nonexistent is at least rebirthing
5168184 what were finding is such insensitivity among a number of representatives because they dont have the foresight you have so many folks who only understand their communities and their needs
5168185 mississippi is not able to sustain poverty and its impact

5168372 the art district has really degenerated into an art theme park instead of a real soho like art district
5168373 there were these unique workshops the rent was low and we were able to freely create art here
5168374 people here are more open to our work and they respect us as contemporary artists
5168375 but in other places such as yuanmingyuan and songzhuang where established artists gather our works are often not accepted
5168376 the art district has really degenerated into an art theme park instead of a real soho like art district
5168377 the district has become a fashionable spot with a fake art feel
5168378 even something as simple as adding or getting rid of pockets can give an old shirt a new look

5168382 el equipo va bien creo que hoy logramos un triunfo que ven amos buscando si hablamos de una derrota que no merec amos ante am rica y de dos empates ante pumas y puebla que bien pudieron ser triunfos vemos que el trabajo finalmente nos da frutos lo importante es mantenerse junto a los primeros lugares del grupo
5168383 el tirador oficial es arce pero con una ventaja de 3 0 y el partido definido bien se puede modificar esta situaci n
5168384 los t cnicos siempre estamos en la orilla el trabajo hecho se ha realizado bien pero no tuvimos el gol no hay ultim tum pero al final de cuentas son los due os los que deciden este tipo de situaciones pero hasta ahora tengo su apoyo me siento orgulloso del equipo hizo un trabajo en la cancha para merecer el resultado lamentablemente no se dio el gol creo que el futbol lo hizo mi equipo mientras santos tuvo el dominio t ctico al jugar con el gol e ir por el pelotazo en definitiva creo que el resultado no reflej lo que pas en la cancha

5168396 tengo muy claro que la fe p blica es un tema que representa estabilidad social legalidad y contribuye a la consolidaci n del estado de derecho
5168397 creo que el estar invirtiendo doblemente pues solamente se puede ver como una falta de eficiencia en la aplicaci n de recursos econ micos del gobierno del estado y eso se debe subsanar con una correcta planeaci n y administraci n del dinero y no da ar el patrimonio o el erario
5168398 hacemos un llamado para que presenten un plan claro concreto a la ciudadan a del desarrollo de la ciudad y el estado y se haga una correcta administraci n de los recursos

5168418 the stewards contributed close to a quarter of a million dollars last thursday when they opened the solevu
5168419 actually this will be the last time any group or province will be opening the solevu becauase as of next year we will still have the solevu and choir competition but no one will open it
5168420 today is the youth day and we are expecting around 40 choirs from churches circuits and divisions around the country
5168421 most of the youths have been here since 11am while waiting to sing at the podium
5168422 most of the old scholars look forward to helping out after work and some take their leave at this time of the year to help out
5168423 we are responsible for co ordinating the choirs as they reach furnival park and how they would be placed until they reach the podium to sing
5168424 however we have made some changes additional pages taking into account the changes that were made at the council meeting
5168425 therefore the cost most likely will increase slightly maybe in the vicinity of 120 000 to 130 000
5168426 this regrettable and unfortunate situation of fiji not participating in the forum meeting in niue arises because of the decision taken by the government of new zealand
5168427 a part of the niue forum meeting the bi lateral meetings will be held in auckland new zealand but the members of the fiji delegation are being denied the opportunity to participate in those meetings and these meetings are integral to the forum meeting
5168428 what was there first the chicken or the egg tobias rehbergers wall painting cannot be imagined without his sculptures just as the egg is impossible without the chicken but is a three dimensional work conceivable without a two dimensional sketch is a chicken possible without an egg what came first rehbergers sculptural work and its shadow image confront one another like the chicken and the egg
5168429 its difficult to get the players i dont think we have the financial backing the top four clubs do
5168430 the longer they are in the champions league the more money they generate normally that money is put back into the team and they can attract more players
5168431 the champions league is a carrot as well most players want to play there which makes it even more difficult for us to attract people
5168432 but as far as im aware the club are trying very hard behind the scenes to get the players in
5168433 you guys with your glass fibers are hitting a roadblock arent you its easy when there is open right of way land available and you can just trench to your hearts content but what about here in the city what makes you think that anyone is going to fork over the capital that metro fiber installation requires
5168434 bandwidth bandwidth copper man youre drained dry when it comes to higher bandwidth but theres an infinite bundle of bandwidth opportunity right under our feet and no one can get at it except for me
5168435 fiber access is too expensive customers are just going to have to lease our copper circuits

5168437 i pull the copper core right out of your cable then i put my fiber bundles into the hollow outer jacket of the cable that is still left in the ground a copper trunk becomes a fiber trunk
5168438 i believe we are good enough to win the title i think were better than the other two
5168439 were in a tricky situation because people want to see big name signings but they also want to see good young players coming through

5168459 instead of criticising the manner he had performed the swearing one should admire his courage to do so
5168460 that is what he is crying for we cannot ignore that
5168461 alcohol can produce detectable impairments in memory after only a few drinks and as the amount of alcohol increases so does the degree of impairment large quantities of alcohol especially when consumed quickly and on an empty stomach can produce a blackout or an interval of time for which the intoxicated person cannot recall key details of events or even entire events

5168465 i think we can do a much better job and not increase taxes
5168466 several years ago the economy was strong we gave that break to people who made over half a million dollars
5168467 now the economy is weak we need to this group of californians to contribute to the economy so those people who make 60 000 40 000 30 000 a year can afford to send their children to school
5168468 we spend every penny the state receives and we spend them on new programs and bigger government
5168469 if we dont pass a budget soon we are going to have to engage in a different type of borrowing borrowing just to pay the day to day services that the state provides
5168470 the governor continues to push legislators to pass a bipartisan budget that he can sign
5168471 i just want to hug my mom spend some time with my family and lie in my own bed and relax if just for 10 minutes

5168475 after the 200 individual medley i started to think we could get there that was when i allowed myself to believe a little bit
5168476 after the semifinal of the 100m butterfly i thought oh my gosh i am really tired but what helped me close all of this out was that i had plenty of time to recover i could take ice baths and i got massages so that helped there was also time that i could just sit on my bed or watch movies
5168477 it has been from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredth to doing my best times in every event
5168478 it has been nothing but an upward rollercoaster and it has also been nothing but fun
5168479 after every final i was tested at a few heats in the run up to the olympics its been a bunch of times but it is part of the game and it is good for the sport
5168480 from here it is a continuation with my goal of raising the sport of swimming as high as i can in the us

5168503 giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5168504 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5168505 mccain may not have been in the cone of silence
5168506 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5168507 mccain may not have been in the cone of silence
5168508 the fact is that during senator obamas segment at saddleback last night senator mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5168509 mccain may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5168510 ive been playing ever since i was in junior high i have always played in bands
5168511 a lot of the stuff that theyre doing now is stuff that they did back in the 50s and 60s with a different twist on the rhythm and on the distortion
5168512 when youre feeling down you just mess around and it feels good
5168513 i like rock because its loud and its fast and its kind of crazy all at the same time
5168514 i just like bands that have great guitar players pretty much

5168519 we may get a few extra false alarms i dont have a problem processing those
5168520 the remoteness probably helps the criminals i would think somebody could stash a car make their way through the woods and after the robbery easily get away without being detected
5168521 if you do your homework you figure out how to stash the car and go through the woods who is going to find you on foot
5168522 you dont have a good escape path many of the roads in barrington hills are dead end streets if someone becomes aware of your presence you have no way out
5168523 thats going to have a lot of bearing on how we finish this year
5168524 the line has a lot to do with that running game too
5168525 it gives us an opportunity to prove ourselves hopefully those teams will be doing well when we face them
5168526 that way well be able to show the nation what we can do
5168527 most of the people that live in naperville and the muslims that live here are professional people
5168528 we mix with them on the same level and theres nothing that singles us out or makes us different
5168529 theres a misconception about what islam stands for and the alleged connection of islam to violence
5168530 when you couple it with the so called war against terror and the focus on global negativity of islam that has made things very difficult for muslims
5168531 this has helped the muslim community mature faster in the united states and build up their own identity
5168532 it is hard to find a good balance between how much you can afford and what is good for your kids
5168533 i dont think that people really focus on the issues of affordability and access of child care for young children
5168534 we want to help policymakers and elected officials understand the issue
5168535 i see this as a vehicle to educate the public and create new advocates

5168537 most painful workout there have been too many to pick one
5168538 im not sure people realize the schedules of these swimmers
5168539 its a tough grind in high school most swimmers practice before school and after school
5168540 if you have multiple kids swimming in a meet one is in the morning session and one swims later
5168541 youre at the meet from 6 a m to 9 p m sometimes but thats just how it is and you deal with it
5168542 every kid is watching swimming right now and thats great
5168543 but i wish broadcasters would talk more about phelps regime people dont have any concept how grueling it is
5168544 but swimming is not an easy sport the older kids swim so many laps it takes a lot of dedication
5168545 all of them tried other sports but they all migrated back to swimming
5168546 they made some of their best friends on swim teams and the sport gave them a great work ethic
5168547 football is something you cant do for the rest of your life
5168548 i plan on not getting any sleep or going to bed before midnight until then
5168549 when they were in mumbai savita used to work and hand over her entire salary to sunil however over three years ago she had taken a break from work and thats when he refused to give her money even for basic necessities like foodgrains or vegetables she was then forced to take up work again the situation repeated itself in pune once again she was without a job and completely dependent on him
5168550 we filed the application under the domestic violence act on december 5 and in march we had demanded that rs 10 000 be paid as maintenance it was orally agreed but he never gave her the money in june when we brought this to the notice of the judge during a hearing the husband was directed to hand over whatever he had in his wallet at that time he handed over rs 3 000 and continued to give her the same amount for the past couple of months
5168551 however neither sunil nor his lawyer would turn up for the hearings and when we brought this to the notice of the judge he passed the interim order
5168552 we are broadly questioning these people about their links and their involvement direct or indirect in bomb blasts in jaipur and other places
5168553 we have known about abdul subhan qureshi for a long while now but several attempts to locate him have failed as he is a wily simi activist who has always managed to give us the slip his name first cropped up after the 7 11 serial blasts when arrested accused like simi members asif khan bashir khan alias junaid and ehteshaam siddiqui dropped his name even let lashkar e toiba operative faisal shaikh named him during his interrogations the ats tried very hard to locate him but he had gone underground
5168554 according to our information at the time qureshi was an important simi member who had undergone training in explosives and was a bomb making expert while we were told he was a class x pass out he was also supposed to be a computer expert
5168555 even in the 7 11 serial blasts case arrested accused like naved hussain and muzammil shaikh got jobs with big companies even though they were not even graduates they attended some computer training courses and also forged documents to get employed
5168556 khans father who runs a medical store in the slums of juhu was called for enquiries to ascertain the whereabouts of his son who is presently absconding
5168557 there is one reason for all these examples of anarchy the absence of the state
5168558 we can only hope that all this will change with the election of a new prime minister
5168559 you can phrase it a lot of different ways but we just have to get better up front
5168560 if you dont have a good offensive line you just aint going to be very good period
5168561 congressman dent is so deep in the pocket of big oil companies and ive noticed the tanker outside hes refusing to publicly defend his record and have an open debate about the issue
5168562 thats fairly juvenile in my view there was a debate candidates forum scheduled for tuesday she sent me a challenge to debate this week i said id look forward to debating her on energy or any other issues we have received a number of debate invitations were going through those right now but she failed to show up and meet with the parkland alumni there were fifty people in the room
5168563 she was invited elmer heiney invited her he most assuredly did i asked him directly she was not there she did not attend
5168564 i talked about my energy policy and hers and i can assure you i am not afraid to debate siobhan bennett i look forward to debating siobhan bennett on energy and other issues during the course of this campaign shes going to have that opportunity i can assure you of that she can go ahead and do her little faux debates on the infomercial but she better be ready laughing she better be ready because well be loaded for bear
5168565 therefore on this data the dark cloud of the market slowdown has still not cast that large a shadow
5168566 in an ideal world we would get it to the point where there would be no barriers
5168567 there have been complaints from time to time but those have been modest
5168568 now i see why ive only been to certain parts of this tunnel
5168569 if these buildings and these tunnels are open to the public they should be ada compliant
5168570 a public accommodation shall remove architectural barriers in existing facilities including communication barriers that are structural in nature where such removal is readily achievable i e easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense
5168571 our buildings including jpmorgan chase tower are handicap accessible at the locations that were designed and constructed per the city of houston building codes including handicap accessible routes that provide access to the tunnel system
5168572 i can go from the four seasons to allen center for a dental appointment without encountering a barrier
5168573 its going to be different its going to be historic and everyone should come out to vote
5168574 im keeping up some with it this year for some reason maybe because there is a black man running
5168575 if i have four people in the car after 9 a m will i have to pay a toll
5168576 the idea is to shut off the lanes so you can collect tolls from 9 a m to 4 p m
5168577 i cant imagine proposing anything to commissioners court that would be taking away something from people who use the hov today
5168578 we want to know if there is really capacity available to be sold during peak hours
5168579 you dont need an ez tag during the first six months
5168580 for years and years and years we tried to redevelop that area but for some reason nobody paid attention to it
5168581 this program might help us move forward and attract more development there
5168582 if somebody wants to invest here more power to them but were not some podunk community
5168583 if youre sitting in beijing or milan or moscow theres a huge mental block
5168584 how am i going to come to the u s set up an active business and hire 10 workers from day one for many people thats a very impractical thing
5168585 its been like this all my life nothing has changed im getting lost here
5168586 we hope to extract about 30 million ounces of silver over the next 10 years and we hope well find more down there
5168587 they call it a ghost town but there are no ghosts here
5168588 at times one feels very alone here everyone who lives here is a family but we need more people
5168589 the local residents were worried about traffic and noise and their water supply cyanide understandably they dont want their lifestyle changed they were looking for jobs
5168590 there will be changes but were trying to not be disruptive we intend to be good neighbors and shafter will continue to be shafter
5168591 i think the chronology indicates other factors are reducing the flow in the creek
5168592 as you can imagine people who move to a place like shafter value their peace and quiet so in a perfect world id rather nothing change
5168593 i knew when i moved here that it was in a mining district so theres always been a sense we were on borrowed time that the mine would reopen
5168594 the problem with the mining company as friendly as it is its a very big dog for the neighborhood
5168595 when i moved here in 1997 the water was knee deep most of the year
5168596 im against the mine but most people in town are a little cautious about what they say against the mine because they provide the water
5168597 the people who are against it werent here when the mine was running all these years weve had the hope of it reopening
5168598 during the mexican revolution my family came to presidio from ojinaga and in 1917 my grandfather came to shafter to work as the main clerk in the company store where all the miners shopped
5168599 the mine was very dangerous it took strong backs and many people died
5168600 in one way it would be good for jobs for the people i know there will be changes
5168601 no more quiet days and nights but i believe it will be all right
5168602 we should not negotiate out of fear but we should not fearful to negotiate
5168603 an eye for an eye keeps the whole world blind
5168604 die isaf bedauert diese trag die zutiefst wenn frauen und kinder get tet und verletzt werden
5168605 we should not negotiate out of fear but we should not fearful to negotiate
5168606 an eye for an eye keeps the whole world blind
5168607 believe me when i said that the feeling was still the same as the first month i got together with you all these while it only got stronger i really love you a lot

5168642 we played well in the first half and their goalkeeper made several good saves to keep them in the match
5168643 our attacking play in the first half was good but as soon as we lost ryan giggs to a hamstring injury and michael carrick with an ankle which is swollen up badly hell be out for two to three weeks we lost a bit of our experience in midfield
5168644 we had possession of the ball but didnt make it count at times but in light of the people we had missing it was a creditable result for us
5168645 that was a good good performance from us and we thoroughly deserved a point
5168646 of course you are going to have to ride your luck when you come to a place like this and we did but no one can say we got more than we deserved
5168647 newcastle fans will go away saying how they witnessed a team playing for the supporters playing for the badge playing for the club and thats what they deserve

5168671 democrats have hitherto said new drilling would do little to relieve consumer pain at the pump accusing republicans of misleading the public and being a pawn of big oil companies yet signs are emerging that they are easing their opposition to the comprehensive ban
5168672 more than 30 democrats have signed up to sponsors legislation that could pave the way for fresh drilling off americas coasts democratic presidential candidate barack obama has also moderated his stance moving from staunch opposition to suggesting that new drilling could be part of a new energy strategy that shift led to accusations from some of his supporters that he had flip flopped
5168673 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
5168674 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most you know the difference between potential and kinetic energy they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us everyone here is working too hard to do stuff we dont care about

5168685 me and matt kemp were out there looking at each other when they tied it up saying what the hecks going on its a big emotional swing but youve got to jump right back on it and stay mentally tough in that situation
5168686 weve had to come up big in some situations and when they present themselves dont back down go up there tough it out really grind out that at bat and make the most of it
5168687 were certainly in a good place right now with a lot of confidence
5168688 we expect to win when we come out here i mean its that intensity without being tense which is where you really want to be i like that type of attitude that we have right now
5168689 that was a gut wrencher there when you lose that kind of lead in the ninth inning especially with two out
5168690 and then to be able to come back and win the game what can i cay i mean it goes from tragic to magical

5168701 i had won an award for my telugu film bommarillu priyan sir had noticed that thats how i got mere baap pehle aap however for aamir khans film i had been screen tested a year before the shooting commenced i was too busy down south however as i had been working non stop i decided to take a months break and come to mumbai the day i was supposed to come back i got a call from aamir khans office saying they wanted to meet me and a week later i was on board
5168702 well films were not on my agenda when they happened it took me a while to realize where i was heading towards initially it was just the excitement of being a star after having done a few films i have fallen in love with the industry
5168703 imran my co star in jaane tu and i hit it off from the day we met we hardly chatted or spoke initially but then as shooting progressed we became friends and today imran is my best friend
5168704 while narrating any sequence he used to sub consciously act it out that made our task much easier

5168710 i think most of us grew up watching these girls i think i was 10 years old when lisa leslie played in her first olympics it was a good experience i think we played pretty well all things considered
5168711 we in the united states are focused on swimming u s won 12 of 32 golds china just one track and field and basketball and we hardly notice that china just won five gold medals in sports like badminton shooting and womens weightlifting
5168712 trying out the indian look any resemblance to my father

5168716 and we find that employee morale is greatly improved after a celebratory occasion and bonuses are handed out
5168717 its my hope to get people out of their cubicles and into the hall for some fun laughter and cocktails

5168727 plamen is a very important part of the team if you have an engine and you take out a piece of that engine you need time for it to start working correctly
5168728 plamen is the right piece of this engine and his return is important for us to get confident before the quarterfinals
5168729 this season coming up after several seasons of the it bag and it shoe were looking at other it items
5168730 were seeing belts in all kind of bright bold colors
5168731 the belt just stands out so much against the skirt
5168732 something that complements the dress or shirt that you are wearing
5168733 but this is my true passion and love this is what ive dreamed of doing since i was 14
5168734 eventually blending at least half of the classic original comic strips with new material
5168735 im starting right at the very beginning when elizabeth was a little crawling baby and couldnt say too much and michael was in kindergarten
5168736 everything in september is new the punch lines the drawing all are new
5168737 the only thing retro is the way im drawing everything i want it to flow into the classic material seamlessly
5168738 at first i thought that i could segue back and forth from today to yesterday but that became very confusing
5168739 because i dont have to work 365 days of new material into a year i can still take some time off to paint and travel
5168740 well im not the type to call attention to myself especially not when im playing golf
5168741 i like the real meticulous look of guys like sam snead and ben hogan they had their own tailors making their clothes back then
5168742 i can fire in the 70s a couple of times a year and then i have been known to blast scores into the hundreds
5168743 we always had fashion photography books around and the pictures reminded me of movie stills
5168744 the fact that i have no one in my life might be reflected in my style
5168745 i dont dry clean my clothes and i live alone oh boy this has taken a depressing turn
5168746 thats why eric clapton wears them all the time you always look better in a suit than a t shirt
5168747 its a little disappointing but all in all i tried to pull out what i could and im really happy
5168748 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5168749 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5168750 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5168751 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5168752 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5168753 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5168754 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5168755 why do you want to become president of the united states

5168760 this camp is a good opportunity for us to see the players after their off season break
5168761 most of the players have just started or are about to start their respective domestic competitions and we can now start focusing on the world cup qualifiers which are just around the corner with that in mind we will be looking to try a few different things in the match against south africa on tuesday night
5168762 if you start to cry then i will buy you candy floss when we go back to liseberg

5168776 we had some mistakes that obviously need to be corrected but we did some things we came in here to do
5168777 we ran the football effectively and im pretty pleased with that we worked this week on the running game and wanted it to click early on
5168778 i dont know whether its unsportsmanlike or not but the first laps i was yelling at them come on guys lets pick up the pace weve got a chance to get seven guys through in this heat
5168779 thats how pedestrian it was i was actually yelling at them
5168780 but in the heat of the moment you do what you can
5168781 nicks capable of a medal on tuesday definitely if he puts the right race together
5168782 he closed great today hes just got to position himself well especially if its slow but hes got all the tools
5168783 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5168784 whether its the seats or the concrete or a door hinge its about the memory
5168785 all these stadiums have come down in the past 15 years and each one has 50 000 seats some more with every stadium down there are x number of people who want a chair then once they get one theyll want another then theyre collectors
5168786 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5168787 it was a total wipeout day for the pitchers that pitched
5168788 a tough day for all of them consequently we got embarrassed everything we threw up there they hit it hard
5168789 they got a couple of hits then a couple more it was kind of over before it even began
5168790 he threw a couple of good pitches that got smoked and he threw some really bad pitches that got smoked he didnt have much but both starters were terrible
5168791 im not talking about getting inside to where youre hitting people or any of that stuff
5168792 but when you have really hot hitters and you dont make them uncomfortable theyll wear you out and thats what he did to us
5168793 he hit the ball like he knew what was coming
5168794 and he probably did too but this was just an unbelievable game im going to get a tape and play it over and over during the winter
5168795 but it didnt happen you cant harp on it you really cant play hard the next day theres not much else you can do
5168796 that weve not been able to maintain a streak because of pitching
5168797 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5168798 its fine that were not ranked because we know what were capable of
5168799 were in the best shape of our lives everyone talks about our defense but i see our offense in practice every day i dont think teams are gonna be ready for that speed
5168800 people are gonna be shocked when they see what they can do
5168801 everybody wants to have pride in the program being ranked but i understand why its not
5168802 it shouldnt be a big deal to our players you look at the guys that have moved on and its understandable
5168803 those guys are quicker picker uppers and i know that sounds like a commercial
5168804 weve thrown a lot of stuff at the quarterbacks and theyve been able to handle it were probably further along installing the offense at this stage than any place before
5168805 its pretty exciting but at the same time pretty nerve wracking
5168806 im not comfortable with any of it right now im more comfortable than a week ago and id better be more comfortable two weeks from now
5168807 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5168808 my mom and dad are not flying over from delhi my birthday is not such a big deal for me id just be happy to spend it with kareena kapoor and my kids
5168809 rakha bandhan is always special for me as my two sisters celebrate it in a big way every year and this year it is even more special because it also coincides with my birthday on earlier occasions of raksha bandhan i have always presented them with gifts but this time i am expecting a gift from them

5168811 a systems capacity to produce unanticipated change through unfiltered contributions from broad and varied audiences
5168812 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5168813 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5168814 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5168815 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play
5168816 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here
5168817 he wanted to earn his keep i wasnt real confident that everything was right just yet but he wanted to give it a shot so we let him give it a shot
5168818 also for selfish reasons we cant have guys down there youre worried about pitching
5168819 i tried to come back too quickly and help the team
5168820 i want to stand up and take my medicine whether its cheers or boos i could throw but i couldnt pitch my velocity was ok but i didnt have any command thats the first sign you are losing it
5168821 i was able to command my mechanics on the side but i couldnt during the game
5168822 its killing me i cant help out i dont want to be a hero i just want to help out
5168823 they didnt make a bad call though they gave me the discretion to try to come back and throw i tried it and proved to myself that i can play catch i just cant come back and pitch
5168824 is that its important to me to take my turn and be accountable now i cant take the brunt of this with everybody
5168825 i physically cant make pitches and if i cant make pitches i get pounded theres something in the back of my shoulder thats loose and clicks
5168826 but im not going this time because the temptation to throw would be too much
5168827 the first time on the dl i wasnt a very good teammate i was kind of pouty and feeling sorry for myself that wouldnt be the case this time because i know i cant throw
5168828 hes above the international league i also did some checking around on my own and got some good reports hes always had a good arm maybe we can hit the right button
5168829 i think the russians have made a significant mistake here

5168844 there was no concept of social networking so i couldnt explain it to people
5168845 the idea was to help you hang out with different groups of friends all in one night it makes my tuesdays more fun
5168846 1 2 3 people and you never never hear about them
5168847 it is a very serious problem and it has led to a whole host of additional problems in the marketplace
5168848 its definitely a vehicle that has and can be used by those who effectively want to push the price of the stock down and do it rapidly
5168849 an extension to every stock is going to begin to make trading in all securities more cumbersome and more expensive
5168850 theres a lot more guys ahead of me in that
5168851 i just worry about making my starts i figure that if every fifth day im ready to pitch at the end of the year those things play themselves out
5168852 ive had some good years but this year ive kind of stood out a little bit more
5168853 maybe because were in the race and people are paying a little more attention i dont know ive played good defense this year
5168854 i made a lot of mistakes when i was young i came up to the league and made a lot of errors that i didnt need to be making
5168855 ive got the ability to play good defense i didnt take advantage early in my career but now im more mature i used to make a lot of throwing errors a lot of stupid errors

5168858 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5168859 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5168860 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5168861 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5168862 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5168863 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5168864 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5168865 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5168926 kalau hendak muzakarah juga kita tanya mereka sebab apa tidak mahu menerima islam dalam semua aspek kehidupan termasuk ekonomi dan budaya kita kena tanya mereka di mana tidak kena islam sehingga umno tidak mahu menerimanya
5168927 hanya ini sahaja yang boleh kalau kita hendak muzakarah dengan umno
5168928 saya hendak tanya siapa yang tidak berikan kalau tidak umno yang sejak dari dahulu lagi tidak mahu orang ramai mendengar ceramah agama
5168929 jadi buat apa kita hendak berunding juga dengan mereka yang tidak mahu membenarkan orang ramai mendengar ceramah agama
5168930 saya pun hairan satu pihak hendak berunding dengan umno dan satu pihak lagi hendak perkukuhkan pakatan rakyat macam mana boleh berlaku sedemikian ini menggelirukan orang ramai
5168931 kalau umno tiada di muka dunia ini orang melayu pun tidak rosak di lima negeri yang dikuasai pakatan rakyat sekarang orang melayu pun boleh hidup juga

5168964 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5168965 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro

5169041 the ayrshire extra is a popular and well respected newspaper which has been recognised for its work on behalf of the local community

5169096 our goal in pursuing a combination of cadence and mentor graphics was to create a company that would offer customers a broader and more fully integrated product and technology portfolio in a timeframe that would better enable them to address urgent and complex challenges associated with their next generation product development
5169097 cadence is a disciplined buyer and will only pursue transactions that make sound financial sense for our shareholders mentor graphics failure to engage in substantive discussions on our all cash premium proposal prevented us from confirming for our financing sources the significant synergies associated with this transaction that along with our revised outlook and the present economic climate led us to conclude that financing terms for the transaction are no longer attractive for our shareholders we remain focused on executing our strategy of delivering holistic solutions that address our customers key challenges while ensuring that cadence operates in the most cost efficient manner

5169099 the payday lending legislation has taken effect from two weeks ago
5169100 some of these people are very unscrupulous people so its hardly surprising that they would look for a number of ways to avoid the law
5169101 the critical difference is that the liberal national party will be paying you for every bit of energy that the solar panels you have generates
5169102 compare that to what labors proposing where theyre only going to pay you for the surplus and for most homes we use more energy than we create at the moment
5169103 what weve seen is that those people who do have a solar panel on their home are actually taking this up at a very very quick rate
5169104 that tells me the scheme is working but of course well monitor it and have a look at it over the coming years
5169105 this is an immense opportunity for the country to get back on the right track and i want to be part of it

5169110 i set some great stage times on friday and with a bit more consistency i will be able to fight for a top place on this surface but i couldnt match the speed of the top two here but i feel my asphalt driving has improved and it was unfortunate i lost time with a puncture last night
5169111 it started well on friday and i had a good position and feeling with the car but yesterday and today were nightmares
5169112 i had a new experience in comparing pirellis hard and soft compound tyres they did a good job for us and were strong this rally also showed me how important mental preparation is i need to work on that this week before rally new zealand and start from zero again to move forwards i also want to complete some asphalt training before the next rally on that surface in spain in october
5169113 we made a good start on friday with a terrific performance from mikko but a lack of experience on the most difficult asphalt rally in the championship with a constantly changing road surface resulted in us not taking as many points as we would have liked however the drivers have learned a lot for the final two rallies on this surface
5169114 weve relinquished the lead in the manufacturers championship here but the fight to win it back begins in new zealand in a fortnight the gravel roads there are more favoured by our drivers and well look to reclaim the series lead immediately

5169243 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5169244 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5169245 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like

5169265 het voedsel raakte op en je oma en ik hadden honger steeds meer honger het werd zo erg dat ik geen andere oplossing meer zag dan er op uit te trekken ik moest voedsel gaan vinden en snel ook anders zou het toch echt niet goed aflopen met ons ik trok er op uit hoeveel kleren had ik aan vrouw

5169345 trump las vegas will bring a new level of luxury and sophistication to the strip
5169346 i had the pleasure of creating a marketing program for the project during the apprentice and i could not be more excited to be putting that plan into action
5169347 im looking forward to getting to know las vegas better and becoming a true member of the community
5169348 las vegas is a perfect place for a trump condominium hotel
5169349 when the tower opens in 2008 residents and guests will be assured that their share of the trump lifestyle is as opulent as they imagined
5169350 the overwhelming response to tower i which is nearly sold out demonstrates the tremendous demand for the trump brand and the level of service and luxury that comes with it
5169351 the addition of a second tower to this already successful project makes perfect sense
5169352 the amenities of tower ii will complement those planned for tower i
5169353 our residents and guests will have everything they need to live the trump lifestyle in las vegas
5169354 donald trump revealed his plans to build the trump international hotel amp tower las vegas during the finale of the apprentice season 2 and the project was 100 percent reserved within three weeks
5169355 i am confident that tonights announcement will have a similar impact
5169356 not only did mr trump go over each detail of the construction progress with the team but he also looked closely at the fully decorated models displayed in our sales office
5169357 he reviewed every facet of the models from the living areas and bathrooms to the bedrooms
5169358 each unit is delivered completely furnished so our homeowners benefit from new products and technology even after they have purchased
5169359 this utilizes the most current technology available saves space and gives guests an added convenience during their stay at trump las vegas
5169360 when people visit a trump property they expect the ultimate luxury experience
5169361 our tv mirrors are designed as one complete unit with speakers installed right into the piece this will debut at the trump international in las vegas offering guests something they truly cant see anywhere else
5169362 the tower is being built by the most successful real estate developer in the world and our buyers trust that we will deliver a product that lives up to its name
5169363 we have seen better than average sales in las vegas
5169364 a large part of our success is due to the trump brand and all that it implies our buyers know that a trump development will be the best possible from the design and construction to the hotel operations and service

5169371 the ownership of money and property comes as a result of doing things in a certain way those who do things in this certain way whether on purpose or accidentally get rich those who do not do things in this certain way no matter how hard they work or how able they are remain poor it is a natural law that like causes always produce like effects therefore any man or woman who learns to do things in this certain way will infallibly get rich

5169378 the olympics is truly about participation but it is also about your moment in time
5169379 my moment in time was with my sister who i love almost more than anyone in the world
5169380 its just amazing to think that we could participate and bring home the gold medal and i am so excited i cant even speak
5169381 i know in the tennis world the grand slams are a little bit more important than here but here you only have one chance every four years
5169382 probably for the tennis players the slams are a little bit more important but for the sportsmen the olympic games are more important than anything
5169383 we really wanted to win we knew this was a really tough tournament but we never gave up we had to be focused
5169384 they were having so much fun we thought we should join them
5169385 this is a wonderful wonderful experience to be here and take in all of this atmosphere
5169386 to walk with all of the other athletes in the opening ceremonies to be in the athletes village just to go out onto the floor each day and compete its a big step forward and a big move for sports in our country
5169387 it was a very big thing in our country to win the african championship
5169388 there was a great deal of national pride for the accomplishment we even received congratulations from our mens team and from men on the street
5169389 it is not just mali it is so many of the african countries that are dominated by the muslim religion
5169390 there are long held beliefs and attitudes that can be difficult if not impossible to overcome many of those people are never going to change where the progress has to be made is among the moderates
5169391 it wasnt so very long ago that when a woman who was an athlete in mali had a baby that meant that her career in sports was over
5169392 women who played sports in senegal would have children and get back into shape and resume playing now we see that the attitude has slowly changed in my own country and women can continue their careers
5169393 many girls that i grew up with and knew had a difficult time playing sports with all of the muslim rules and regulations
5169394 there are prohibitions against wearing shorts against bearing your arms
5169395 my family was always very moderate with my mother as a former player she always encouraged me to play my father too is a moderate person and a forward thinker both of my parents have encouraged me throughout my athletic career
5169396 this is about getting our experience at the international level and learning about the things we will need to someday be competitive
5169397 i played a game i truly loved to play since i was a kid
5169398 they gave me a number and now its hanging from the rafters
5169399 i got a chance to watch craig become one of the best second basemen to ever play this game
5169400 to have my number retired next to yours is not only fitting but truly an honor
5169401 we stood next to each other for so many years we had a great ride now we stand side by side forever my friend
5169402 we went to the astrodome and the rodeo was in town and there was no astroturf just dirt
5169403 so we drew a diamond and he taught me how to play the position the right way i will never forget that
5169404 i remember him telling me if we do this switch i dont want to be just good at it
5169405 i told him if you want to be really good at this you have to think about gold gloves he won four of them
5169406 like when he would accidentally move his arm out and accidentally get hit by the pitch
5169407 i have no regrets as far as any of the decision making i ever made in my career because ive done everything this organization ever asked me to do
5169408 if that day is to come and happen in a couple of years
5169409 i get goose bumps thinking about it if thats to happen how great would it be for a city i love so much an organization i love so much and for my family and i well keep our fingers crossed
5169410 it has a different meaning to win gold in my own country
5169411 i waited for four years and trained for four years it was tough and i had some setbacks it was not as seamless as it appeared to be
5169412 but she did fabulous she made me proud and she made the cougars proud we love the fact that she represents our school and the state of texas in such a great matter
5169413 its been a fantastic journey with this girl since she was 6 years old
5169414 shes like my little girl she did a nice job and im really proud of her
5169415 kenny has been such a huge influence in my life i will always treasure the times that we had together
5169416 i think hes earned the right to get some reps with the first group
5169417 were going to probably go three quarters this week with our first group hell definitely become part of that
5169418 there are still some mistakes that concern you the closer you get to the season but its obvious he can be a big help to us
5169419 obviously we didnt fix it from week one to week two
5169420 whoevers going to be back there has to protect the ball
5169421 theres a lot of responsibility there but hey this is the big boys and hes got to step up handle it and do his job
5169422 i dont know how we can keep him off the field
5169423 its easy to sit there and say well where does he fit in if andres back healthy and youve got andre davis and kevin
5169424 is he doing enough to get on the field really quick yeah at this point he sure is hes special as coaches its our job to have him in position to help us win
5169425 most of duanes mistakes are coming in the run game its not a lack of effort he knows what hes doing hes working hard and getting better every day
5169426 i have a collection of medals now which is really cool
5169427 i have a few more finals so hopefully ill add to that and at least tie my dad if not break his record
5169428 i dont care about scores i just want to go out and hit the best routine i can but if i do get the gold on beam ill be the happiest person in the world
5169429 considering she landed on her knees i thought the deduction would be higher
5169430 when you are at the home of the other gymnast its hard to win
5169431 shes a fighter she proved the last five years shes a fighter
5169432 i dont know what happened in team finals she took too much on herself in the team competition being the captain she took more from the mental aspect and this way she forgot about her own personal duties as a gymnast
5169433 this has been stressful but its a great learning experience it will make me a better person
5169434 im sure that someday ill totally appreciate what it is but i still have to kind of get to that point
5169435 i shouldnt have been thinking about the dismount and fell on one of my signature skills i shouldnt be falling on but im happy i stayed on when it counted in team finals in which the u s won a bronze medal this routine is ready for the next four years
5169436 its been four long years of heartache that weve had to relive over and over
5169437 for us to go home with a silver medal is truly an honor
5169438 i dont want the world to remember team usa as being failures
5169439 this is probably the best game ive seen him throw in two or three years
5169440 i thought it was without question his best outing this year and the second best outing ive ever seen him throw
5169441 the other was in 05 game 6 of the nlcs i think we saw two of the best ever throw sunday the other guy was pretty good but made one mistake and it cost him
5169442 i was looking for a pitch middle in from randy and i think he probably made a mistake and i was able to get it
5169443 i didnt make the pitch i needed to and roy pitched outstanding
5169444 you kind of knew after the first two games 12 2 and 11 5 arizona wins to see that kind of a performance three times wouldve been a lot to ask for
5169445 he pitched outstanding and i made one mistake which i guess is what it comes down to i started making the pitches after the fact and thats pretty much the whole ballgame really
5169446 i dont like the walks too much but i was able to recover on the one guy and pence threw the other guy out
5169447 big throw from the field and we got it going after the third inning
5169448 we always kind of check with oswalt a little bit
5169449 hes our stud so we check with him after an inning to see how he is and he was running on some fumes at the end i let the big boy finish
5169450 i started getting a little bit tired in the eighth laboring a little bit
5169451 i felt myself coming off the ball some and the ball was tailing back over the plate but i had enough to get through the eighth and valverde came in and closed it out
5169452 some of these things come back right away and theyre ready to go a lot of players play with these things
5169453 we have had some pleasant surprises like the fencing sweep along with some disappointments but we are on track compared to our performance in athens
5169454 our goal coming into these games was to find new medal opportunities to better diversify where our medal production comes from based on early results in sports like fencing and shooting we are making an impact into those targeted sports
5169455 when i crossed the line and saw sherone and kerron there that was the moment
5169456 were getting a taste of what its like to be on the bottom
5169457 the province currently the theatre of a massive us led military crackdown targeting shiite militiamen allegedly involved in weapons smuggling shares a 200 kilometre 125 mile border with iran
5169458 there is a newly discovered field in wasit province in central iraq with the potential to fill millions of barrels of oil under the law this new field will be given over to multinationals
5169459 this field lies in the two provinces of baghdad and salaheddin and probably extends southward within the province of wasit 1 hence it should be jointly managed by the provinces of both baghdad and salaheddin and perhaps that of wasit too initial production has averaged 20 000 barrels per day from its baghdad section compared with a potential production of about 120 000 barrels daily
5169460 hinting at reigniting a saddam era oil deal though such a move is clouded by iraqs stalled oil law
5169461 to review draft iraq subsoil laws and draft subsoil regulations to ensure their compliance with international legal standards
5169462 cowardice asks the question is it safe expediency asks the question is it politic vanity asks the question is it popular but conscience asks the question is it right and there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe nor politic nor popular but one must take it because ones conscience tells one that it is right
5169463 i think the coolest thing about being an astros fan is that they love the astros logo so much
5169464 but they surely love the person who wears it more
5169465 keep that number alive and this is something to motivate the next kid coming along pose that to drayton see what he says
5169466 if i were the next guy i would think that would be too much pressure
5169467 wasnt it bobby murcer who replaced mickey mantle in center field he was a great player if he hadnt replaced mickey mantle he probably would have been even greater thats intimidating when you put someone in mickey mantles place or craig biggios place at second base or jeff bagwells place thats a lot of pressure
5169468 this is the number of craig biggio for two decades he did everything this franchise asked of him he gave more effort and got more out of his ability than anybody in his generation honor his memory
5169469 you think about it and there are only two no 7s ever retired mickey mantle and craig biggio i grew up on long island in new york thats how i started off i love this game everything i have is because of the game and my passion for the game i try to give back to the game as much as i can to have your number retired thats pretty high cotton

5169477 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5169478 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5169479 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5169480 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5169481 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5169482 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution

5169614 i just see the image of this family in american suburbia loading their kid into a suburban and driving them to school thats whats been going on
5169615 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5169616 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else

5169618 most of the people that live in naperville and the muslims that live here are professional people
5169619 we mix with them on the same level and theres nothing that singles us out or makes us different
5169620 theres a misconception about what islam stands for and the alleged connection of islam to violence
5169621 when you couple it with the so called war against terror and the focus on global negativity of islam that has made things very difficult for muslims
5169622 this has helped the muslim community mature faster in the united states and build up their own identity
5169623 pinching is a way of controlling the rate of growth of a plant
5169624 its used more to control the overall shape of a plant
5169625 generally youre going to be finished with pinching by the end of june

5169635 im sick of watching films on all the other guys i want to get out there and then watch myself correct my own errors

5169639 the psu banks will be the best buying opportunity starting from state bank of india going to the other second rung banks bank of india canara bank or bank of baroda i would stay away from the private sector banks
5169640 axis bank is a good stock to own and to trade in one just has to be patient it is falling and one has to lead the decline stop that applies to most stocks today
5169641 the same thing applies to uco bank i would say that these stock is a buying opportunity for investors for traders it is going to go into f amp o segment very soon one should wait patiently let this correction decline be over both the stocks can be bought

5169672 its just shocking i cant believe it all these years you have these copper gutters here and come to work one day and theyre gone
5169673 the price of copper has gone up and theyre police assuming thats why
5169674 explained anne carlino building supervisor for the libertyville civic center foundation which operates the building
5169675 somebody had to get up in a very difficult spot to get that gutter off
5169676 we see reports of thieves just taking copper wire off the utility poles
5169677 typically when we see the economy gets a little more tight if theres a profit to be made somebody is going to do it
5169678 unfortunately there is a market for stolen copper and things of that nature
5169679 its going to cost a lot more than that to fix the building
5169680 if we want to maintain our historic status the expectation is we replace them as they originally were on the building
5169681 something like this happening really points out this building is an important structure and its costly when something is taken

5169690 we may get a few extra false alarms i dont have a problem processing those
5169691 the remoteness probably helps the criminals i would think somebody could stash a car make their way through the woods and after the robbery easily get away without being detected
5169692 if you do your homework you figure out how to stash the car and go through the woods who is going to find you on foot
5169693 you dont have a good escape path many of the roads in barrington hills are dead end streets if someone becomes aware of your presence you have no way out
5169694 ive been playing ever since i was in junior high i have always played in bands
5169695 a lot of the stuff that theyre doing now is stuff that they did back in the 50s and 60s with a different twist on the rhythm and on the distortion
5169696 when youre feeling down you just mess around and it feels good
5169697 i like rock because its loud and its fast and its kind of crazy all at the same time
5169698 i just like bands that have great guitar players pretty much
5169699 i took lessons at el rey and now shes taking lessons at el rey so its kind of an institution
5169700 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
5169701 to the mall the playground play dates to target just to go somewhere
5169702 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
5169703 we just dont have as much money as we used to
5169704 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
5169705 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
5169706 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom id rather do the job myself
5169707 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
5169708 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
5169709 we are not staying home with our children by default
5169710 if for some reason you dont get your statement on time that would be a red flag that something might not be right
5169711 trying to compare them is like trying to compare apples and oranges
5169712 the park is very versatile and can accommodate a lot of different types of users
5169713 the water temperature everything was pretty good there we just got unlucky
5169714 i was looking forward to getting a lot of laps under our belt here and getting comfortable and making sure everything was together underneath me and we were going to have a great day
5169715 it just didnt work out its just experience so its just hard thats whats bad about this deal here
5169716 we want people to know that the program is not right for everyone
5169717 its for people who drive at low risk times of day and who keep alert for others on the road
5169718 they dont make fast lane changes or follow too closely behind other drivers so they dont have to overreact or slam on the brakes
5169719 the consumer is really being given an opportunity to potentially reduce their auto insurance premium in exchange for giving their auto insurer access to information that currently isnt available to them
5169720 we see this as kind of a creeping abduction of peoples data
5169721 basically once they collect that data it belongs to the insurance company thats a big problem
5169722 i think chinese rowing has made rapid progress in recent years but we are lagging behind in terms of experience
5169723 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
5169724 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
5169725 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
5169726 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
5169727 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
5169728 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
5169729 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
5169730 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
5169731 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
5169732 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
5169733 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
5169734 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
5169735 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
5169736 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
5169737 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
5169738 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
5169739 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
5169740 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
5169741 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
5169742 most painful workout there have been too many to pick one
5169743 im not sure people realize the schedules of these swimmers
5169744 its a tough grind in high school most swimmers practice before school and after school
5169745 if you have multiple kids swimming in a meet one is in the morning session and one swims later
5169746 youre at the meet from 6 a m to 9 p m sometimes but thats just how it is and you deal with it
5169747 every kid is watching swimming right now and thats great
5169748 but i wish broadcasters would talk more about phelps regime people dont have any concept how grueling it is
5169749 but swimming is not an easy sport the older kids swim so many laps it takes a lot of dedication
5169750 all of them tried other sports but they all migrated back to swimming
5169751 they made some of their best friends on swim teams and the sport gave them a great work ethic
5169752 football is something you cant do for the rest of your life
5169753 i plan on not getting any sleep or going to bed before midnight until then
5169754 the number of people staying at lazarus house has surpassed 70 several times in the past weeks

5169764 it is hard to find a good balance between how much you can afford and what is good for your kids
5169765 i dont think that people really focus on the issues of affordability and access of child care for young children
5169766 we want to help policymakers and elected officials understand the issue
5169767 i see this as a vehicle to educate the public and create new advocates
5169768 of course then the beatles happened on ed sullivan and everything changed
5169769 it was almost like you had somebody from your own generation all of a sudden you had a contemporary or a peer
5169770 you go back and you look at the old radio playlists and you had all these different things
5169771 today everything is so narrowcast nobody gets any cross pollination which i think is a huge loss
5169772 all i wanted to do was record myself it never occurred to me i could actually have a real studio
5169773 of course everybody wants to do the record in the basement and come up with a grammy
5169774 but thats not going to happen at least i dont think it is

5169785 engrained in our dna is the spirit of jim piccolo delves into the rich history of our nation which was built on freedom and the examples set forth by our forefathers to show us what we can do to make ourselves and our nation strong again
5169786 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5169787 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5169788 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
5169789 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
5169790 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again
5169791 the concierge found the property for me with just a click of a mouse there it is they also found the mortgage company they found my lease option tenant they did all the work and we were able to close in our own living room
5169792 i know that he told me to go but my duty is here
5169793 do you have these kind of audacious friends who will take you to jesus
5169794 this is an important potential cure it is possible one injection could switch off the abnormal immune response
5169795 if it works it could reverse the disease and stop further episodes
5169796 based on previous laboratory research we would expect that this will specifically suppress or down regulate the auto immune response
5169797 we dont want the case to be handled here in murfreesboro
5169798 the police departments in this county are both working together to cover things up we want the tennessee highway patrol to come do their own investigation
5169799 this new tape proves that the police didnt take him to a hospital like they should have
5169800 instead they took him to a store to get liquids so he could sober up
5169801 we just ask that the criminal investigation in this matter be moved to another county
5169802 i believe that some of the police in this county really do believe they are above the law
5169803 the idla was founded by rickard to combat and to open the border between the united states and canada freely to indians once this aim had been achieved he and members continued the organization to carry on the fight for indian rights in general and to educate both indians and non indians on the values of indian culture
5169804 what has made you want follow this path in your life in terms of gardening
5169805 for as long as i remember i liked to work in the garden when i was five i would harvest cucumbers with my parents for the pickle factory to make money we would use a horse drawn stoneboat to pull the load uphill
5169806 when we had 12 people sitting at the table we really had to have that garden produce
5169807 i just hope i am helping them eat good food and keep seeds we are all seed keepers
5169808 beware of thinking of our lord as only a teacher if jesus christ is only a teacher then all he can do is frustrate me by setting a standard before me i cannot attain
5169809 but when i am born again by the spirit of god i know that jesus christ did not come only to teach he came to make me what he teaches i should be the redemption means that jesus christ can place within anyone the same nature that ruled his own life and all the standards god gives us are based on that nature
5169810 if then you have been raised with christ seek the things that are above where christ is seated at the right hand of god set your minds on things that are above not on things that are on earth for you have died and your life is hidden with christ in god when christ who is your life appears then you also will appear with him in glory
5169811 is your relationship with god sufficient for you to expect him to exhibit his wonderful life in you
5169812 he did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief
5169813 why doesnt god appear to us today like he did in the scriptures
5169814 do i really dare to let god be to me all that he says he will be
5169815 artificial intelligence involves programming a computer to perform tasks that model human behavior often with the goal of making the computers performance indistinguishable from that of a human two aspects of this pursuit have been applied to the evolution of cognitive behavioral therapy first learning about performance in computer models of aspects of disorder may make it possible to learn about ways to cognitively remediate a disorder the second involves using computers to actively perform therapy with people

5169821 the mosque itself exceeds the narrow purpose of being a place for prayer
5169822 its a place for social gathering a place for personal growth
5169823 my philosophy about this is we are part of this country we are part of this civilization
5169824 interfaith programs are something that weve been focusing on especially after sept 11 because of negative things that are exposed on television
5169825 to me its very telling of the growth of the muslim community and their involvement with their american counterpart
5169826 by being part of this country muslims have to give back to society take care of americans and american institutions around them
5169827 muslim americans have a significant role to play in the betterment of this country
5169828 it has been an effort of the whole parish and the culmination of six or seven years of work
5169829 we have a growing community a committed group of parents and a whole group of parishioners enthusiastic about a grade school everything came together at the right time
5169830 now a whole new group will have christ at the center of all of their classes
5169831 it will help parents raise their children in the faith and it is a statement of hope in the future batavia is a vibrant city and its an opportunity to say that we want to be a part of that
5169832 its been a blessing to be able to meet all the parents
5169833 the fifty fifty calls go the way of the team thats creating the momentum
5169834 the tackles we were making were putting them behind the advantage line so we were going forward
5169835 when you get a situation like that the calls tend to favour the guys going forward and i think thats where we perhaps got a couple of calls
5169836 i just felt the tackle players were lying there but we will have to go back and see if we could have done something about it ourselves

5169843 we cant tell the justice department not to do it
5169844 the question will be how the department decides how to implement the regulations and to what degree the department has tried to minimize them but its uncertain how much

5169856 our strikers did such a great job that i even told them they should start playing for our mens team now
5169857 its so beyond an embarrassment that it almost seems like a comedy

5169874 if its under 100 its not going to be generally profitable for us to do anything
5169875 so its a complimentary service the hotel is giving away and the hotel is paying us to provide that
5169876 its literally a desk with a computer on it and a printer
5169877 when you get over 200 rooms and stay below 700 rooms thats kind of a sweet spot for a business center
5169878 there is so much behind the scenes that is incredibly complicated and very difficult to do
5169879 thats why theres not very many people specializing in it
5169880 most of the deals where we are charging are revenue share we make money by the hotel guests using our stuff
5169881 it can be everything from we keep it all to they get 90 percent and its everything in between
5169882 we are really very flexible with our customers depending what the requirements are for what they are trying to accomplish and what we are trying to accomplish
5169883 paul and i got together and said if we are going to be for real in this business we are going to have to develop our own solutions
5169884 hotels will be our biggest revenue for five more years
5169885 in the hotel segment you typically have clients that expect everything to be perfect all the time and you have an industry that promotes that perfection

5169891 about the time that happened i started hearing horror stories from friends whose parents were experiencing severe health problems and racking up astronomical medical bills that werent adequately covered

5169905 the best hoax are done by religious guiltless individuals or groups that are supported by fanatic members
5169906 watch how the desperate move of the iglesia ni cristo of mr manalo to malign the person of bro eli soriano considering the intelligent viewers of the philippine televisions and us who have the original copy of the tape these ministers of inc got the unimaginable nerve to televise a mangled and intentionally adulterated tape to show up a different meaning in a scheme to discredit bro soriano
5169907 bottom line these republicans want to debate straw men because theyre afraid to debate real men and this time it wont work because were going to stay in their face with the truth
5169908 let all therefore thank god for having with us bro eli who is ready and willing to defend the truth and gods words from the abuses of false bible scholars salamat sa dios
5169909 the water temperature everything was pretty good there we just got unlucky
5169910 i was looking forward to getting a lot of laps under our belt here and getting comfortable and making sure everything was together underneath me and we were going to have a great day
5169911 it just didnt work out its just experience so its just hard thats whats bad about this deal here
5169912 i could move the car around i wasnt tight at all which is really good for us get the best of foxtel
5169913 thats a very delicate age and i wanted to see if poetry could survive better if we exposed students not to a sampling of poets per se but to poetry you can get on the first reading
5169914 thats how poetry 180 a poem for every day of the school year was born i wanted to use the poems as bait to snag the students interest
5169915 its one of only two things thats impossible to teach
5169916 the first is rhythm and the second is metaphor its just so basic to poetry a connect the dots as you go along kind of thing
5169917 i used to fish but when everyone got environmentally conscious and switched to catch and release i had to quit
5169918 i was always killing the fish before i could release them from the hook and back into the water
5169919 catch and release that sounds like a metaphor for a lot of relationships ive seen
5169920 i think im just being brought in as a spectacle of some kind
5169921 whats surprising to me is that theres not 20 to 30 other poets enjoying this kind of success or selling more books than they are if my books sold the way poets books tend to sell 3 000 to 5 000 copies id be very happy poets dont have the expectations of novelists of selling options for movies
5169922 i think its very dangerous to be clear i dont think its at all risky to be unintelligible sometimes extremely difficult poetry is just a hiding place for poets who dont have anything to say its hard to detach envy from honest criticism i think so called difficult poetry is often very rude it ignores the presence of the reader it wants to be an act of writing taking place in front of you but it doesnt want to address you
5169923 if youre writing the poem in solitude in a room writing to a single reader it tends to make the tone of the poem more intimate
5169924 i think it has something to do with slowing down because poetry is a short form you can read a poem in a minute or a minute and a half people have a concentrated experience as opposed to sitting with a novel all night or watching a movie for a few hours
5169925 people dont read poetry to find the poet they read it to find themselves
5169926 people are tired of the public noise it lacks the personal element of one person speaking to another poetry is like standing on the edge of a lake on a moonlit night and the light of the moon is always pointing straight at you
5169927 its sort of like mr hyde wants to muddy up the laboratory theres a little salieri and mozart in everybody we want to sound like mozart but it often takes a lot of salieri like plotting and revision
5169928 theres always the question about where the poem is going so you cant really take a break for lunch instead you take out a screwdriver and you go at it someone once said that revision isnt cleaning up after the party it is the party the point is to make the poem as good as possible poetry is an act of understanding i try to stick around long enough to figure it out
5169929 in most of my poems theres a shift into another avenue somewhere near the end of the poem
5169930 thats what makes me smile when i move the poem to another arc that im not so sure about anymore when the scene shifts im not so sure of myself
5169931 to use that question how many angels fit on the head of a pin was meant to make fun
5169932 by bringing in the jazz angel i was being a bit of a theological provocateur it was a slight bit of sacrilege i didnt know that angel existed before i wrote the poem poetry is a fishing expedition you dont know whats out there until you start to write
5169933 i have no idea where that came from it just popped out youd think i struggled over it but i didnt its kind of a cleaning out the brain thing a theme arises that just gets you going and then you come out the end of the tunnel with this big fat song
5169934 i think its a reflection of the times quite frankly
5169935 its a pretty uncertain world that looks like were heading into chaos any minute every civilized country ends in ruin and just like ancient egypt i think this one will too
5169936 you run through it with rehearsals to see if everyones got their stuff together
5169937 this kind of song wouldnt be possible without bob dylan
5169938 somebody had to write the book open minds to this kind of writing
5169939 i came up with the title years ago around the time i was writing the short stories for carp fishing on valium
5169940 i was lucky enough to have a credible publishing house st
5169941 anyway i had that idea of a song title and i tried it with a reggae beat but it just wasnt there
5169942 now fast forward to modern times and the bush administrations and this whole new thing thats kicked in the sunday new york times did this big expos about video news being released on tv made by the government they did it in the clinton years as well but this administrations bread and butter is to influence the media theyve done it on no child left behind theyve done it on the iraq war the thing ends with a woman saying something like this is carol ann so and so reporting shes not reporting shes reading a damn script
5169943 has rock n roll just died or does it just smell bad
5169944 you need a real strong finish that never quits like english toffee on hominy grits a buttery flavor that goes on and on with a hint of grease and a nose too long but you gotta do it your own way on cigarettes and bad chardonnay yeah cigarettes cigarettes and bad chardonnay
5169945 thats a good line that is it reminds me of the taste of chardonnay that just goes on and on you get a mouthful of treacle english molasses and it just wont go away it relates to the awful foulness of chardonnay i mean is there such a thing as a good chardonnay its ubiquitous i guess kendall jackson might be good ive had a long standing joke in my rider demanding that promoters supply a bottle of bad chardonnay it fuels my life
5169946 what are you gonna do with all this stuff man
5169947 ive got a large parcel of land here whereas id have to be as rich as elton john or prince charles to get this in england
5169948 im still expecting that any minute now sammy hagars gonna call up and say hey man what gives
5169949 you take a grain of reality and blow it up thats drama you riff on it like a jazz musician and it builds and builds you make changes and rewrite it
5169950 i strive to find deep threads i reject bad ideas as best as i can front brain ideas i call them the things that any other songwriter can come up with i toss off
5169951 its like playing pinball and wherever the ball goes youre looking for an escape route
5169952 my biggest fear is mediocrity and thats why songwriting is so hard theres no two ways about it
5169953 theres a guy who had the temerity to sing in a band with bob dylan and sound like bob dylan
5169954 my mother didnt try to stab my father until i was six
5169955 never have your dog stuffed and other things ive learned
5169956 one of the things i was doing in the book was writing about somebody who was just one of us who turns out to be famous after awhile but even then is still just one of us
5169957 its not a book about a famous person about somebody destined for fame but about somebody trying to learn how to live
5169958 what ive learned is that whatever happens happens and eventually you move on from there
5169959 its a little like what happened with my mother i could have said i wanted a different mother but if i didnt have a sick mother i wouldnt be the man i am today theres no point in regretting anything except if you do something reprehensible then its not a good idea to do it again but if you can understand what you did at the time then theres a chance to learn a lesson from it its all building blocks like when youre writing the main point is to put down everything that comes to you at the time without editing you cant rewrite the past
5169960 i learned more about life being married for 48 years than from any job i ever had
5169961 one saturday we spent a few hours on the boardwalk by the ocean taking publicity shots about a week later i came down with polio
5169962 never have your dog stuffed and other things iive learned
5169963 i learned that i can apply the same skills to life like listening im talking about really listening and not just waiting for your turn to talk
5169964 the older i get the more i learn about myself and about other people from playing other characters i always end up different than when i started out but thats the lesson
5169965 it was a world of coarse jokes and laughter late into the night a world of gambling and drinking and the frequent sight of the buttocks thighs and breasts of naked women
5169966 the newspaper printed the picture and ran a story under it that sixty seven years later is a gold mine of information on how not to raise a child
5169967 im struck by how i grew up among people who didnt seem to know what children were
5169968 i suspected i was dumped in wilmington because of a pig my parents loved more than me
5169969 if it didnt involve putting the dog in the ground and starting in with the shovels again it sounded good to me
5169970 losing the dog wasnt as bad as getting him back
5169971 i wish i knew he probably fell to pieces on the porch where we left him when we moved back to new york i know we didnt take the dog with us thank god
5169972 joe strummer called me up in jamaica and asked me to come to london and work this song for them
5169973 it was a rock song and i turned it into a reggae song it was a great song but their record company didnt want to release it so they released it in germany and it was a huge hit eventually because of the fans they had to release it in england and it became their first big hit
5169974 everyone who was anyone kept coming by the studio and finally we couldnt get anything done
5169975 i still love joe strummer mick jones paul simonon and topper headon because i dont think they did me wrong
5169976 i dont blame the clash i blame the people around the clash i still feel good that joe gave me the opportunity to take them and their music to this whole new idea and for the whole thing to be a success
5169977 it all depends on the people there and the vibe of the place
5169978 the show became an overnight hit with the everyday people
5169979 i spent five years fighting to get back the rights to all of my old records and ive learned a lot along the way that i try to use and help educate new artists just starting out
5169980 twenty five years after producing the clash and after they and i became successful ive still got no money
5169981 people are just fascinated with new england in other parts of the country to me its just going outside but if you live in arizona going into the maine woods has a frightening allure
5169982 mcmorrow is me without the compromises people make in real life the decisions that take you away from doing good journalism
5169983 he doesnt have a family for one thing having a family was important to me hes sort of the quintessential reporter in my view the one who doesnt compromise as hes writing the story or afterwards in some ways hes doing the kinds of things we all hope we could do if he feels an injustice is being done he plunges in we have the same past same experiences one of us is stalking the other im not sure who
5169984 when i was a reporter i guess i always wanted to be like him mcmorrow
5169985 id been in situations not dangerous to the point of people shooting at me but there were a couple of times where i was threatened to the point of where i was worried about it or worried for my family
5169986 i was in a seedy situation in waterville where i was pushed from one guy to another and another and finally this one guy went for my notebook we got in a bit of a wrestling match and then i got out of there with my notebook but the thing that was more dangerous to me was heading off into the hinterlands looking for a story i didnt know where i was going nobody knew where i was going and this was in the days before cell phones id be at the end of some trail in the boondocks and if something did happen theyd just roll your car out behind the barn and take it apart bury you out in the woods
5169987 id had some experience with the world of the connellys being on the coast in the summer
5169988 i like boats and being on them some time ago we were on penobscot bay and i said to myself what would mcmorrow think of this in the beginning you think well theyre just trash but thats too easy to hate the wealthy so i turned it around to make the wealthy connellys much more sympathetic
5169989 roxanne saves her from being badly beaten by a bunch of kids and he latches onto jack but he brings all his problems and his familys problems with him in his wake this ones set all in maine and its very gritty there are some really complex characters especially the kids
5169990 she had lived out in the woods and shed told me how when she came to portland the initiation on the streets was to just get the crap beat out of you because you were the new kid that story always stuck with me
5169991 when i started i didnt have any idea how to do it
5169992 but that was probably more rewarding than all the other things that happened along the way because then i knew i could do this
5169993 up til then i kept thinking what if im crazy
5169994 wir m ssen uns jetzt damit besch ftigen wie das jahr 2020 aussieht
5169995 wenn wir sozialdemokraten diese unbestreitbaren erfolge unserer politik nicht loben werden andere diese erfolge f r sich reklamieren
5169996 wir k nnen uns doch nicht den launen von oskar lafontaine aussetzen
5169997 twelfth night is of no genre it is not of hamlets cosmological scope but in its own very startling way is another poem unlimited one cannot get to the end of it because even some of the most apparently incidental lines reverberate infinitely
5169998 most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them
5169999 the only man for me does me wrong never calls me on the phone leaves me all alone stands me up always lets me down and cannot be found
